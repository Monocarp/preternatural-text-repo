Saint Walbert, contemporary of Gregory VII and founder of the order, had there erected an oratory to the Blessed Virgin. In his life he had, when a dying monk was grievously terrified by a vision of a demon, driven it off with a cross which he took from the hand of the dying man. The monks preserved the cross there, and it soon served to test the possessed with it to determine whether they were truly demonic. Later the arm that had borne the crucifix to victory was also discovered; and from that time the Church of Our Lady at Valombrosa became a refuge for the possessed for all Tuscany; indeed, they came in swarms even as far as the borders of France.

He was well informed about everything that occurred with her day by day; for she concealed nothing from him. All are unanimous that he was learned enough not to be easily deceived in matters of the spirit; sufficiently clever not to be taken in by appearances; possessed of adequate keenness to distinguish false virtue from true; and if no other testimony existed, his writing would speak for him. He declares that he has written with all truth and exactness, and he appeals each time to what he saw with his eyes and touched with his hands, mentioning only in passing other things that he had learned by hearsay. He knew, moreover, that he had unusual things to relate, and warns the nuns not to let themselves be led astray by them.

With further inquiry the cathedral library was indicated as the place to which the books had been delivered; and soon there everything that could possibly be found was put before the inquirer with friendly willingness. The following manuscripts were among them:\n\nI: A parchment volume in small quarto from the year 1465 (8 Kal. Jun.), written in old Italian, under the title: Jesus Maria. Hieronimus s. P. Presbyter ad Eustochium monialem reclusam et ad ceteras sorores. In the beginning it says: \"Dilecta filia, in me ha domandato et tu desidero de intendere alguna cosa utile del giudicio finale.\" --- \"Beloved daughter, you have asked me and you desire to understand something useful about the final judgment.\" This desire, he then continues, is just, and in no way should its fulfilment be refused, and he cites in this matter the judgment of St.\u00a0Bernard. He then proceeds in the first part to the workings of the malignant spirits, setting forth the experiences and thoughts of St.\u00a0Anthony about them; he then expatiates on the diversi inganni del Demonio --- the various deceits of the Devil --- further on le arme de' Demoni --- the weapons of the Demons --- and on the weapons of prayer against demonic apparitions. Then he treats of the angels and the good spirits and their helpful activity. The second section then speaks at length of the Last Judgment, of Gog and Magog, of the Antichrist and the other apocalyptic apparatus. The third deals with the manner in which one should humble oneself before God's judgment in life, and with patience accept what He has decreed.

When the exorcism was applied, his spirit began to speak and recounted how he, bound by a charm, could not free himself until that charm placed under his threshold was removed. The monks, however, attached no credence to these words and continued with the invocation. The possessed then became entirely furious, and with a wild, burning eye cried out: \"O cross! O torment! what must I endure; for what, you villains, all the praying, and the singing and toil! You well know what I said before.\" Some of those who had brought him into the monastery thought now that one must remove whatever might be found there; the monks, however, prevented anyone from proceeding to the work, so that it should not appear as if they had credited the devil, or that he had only departed after the removal of the charm. They therefore continued calmly and unconcerned with the exorcism; but he now tore himself away from the hands of those holding him, was thrown to the ground by the demon, and tormented as never before. This continued for a while; at last the demon, exhausted and unable to resist further, departed.\n\nBut it was worth the trouble, says Hieronymus, to hear what voices he uttered, even afterwards wandering about in the sanctuary; it would have seemed incredible to me were it not for the credible persons who, as eyewitnesses, gave me an account of everything. Such a clamor and tumult and trembling accompanied the departure that one thought the church and monastery were coming to ruin. Having returned to Florence, the people, disregarding the prohibition in the monastery, searched what lay beneath the threshold, and found a bundled, silk\u2011thread\u2011bound cloth, and in it a piece of the bone of a dead child, a woman's hair, the skin of a donkey's hide, with certain signs and c"}, "Possessed Woman of Calcia, Necromantic Formula, and Death of the Monk at Perusium": {"start_char": 39344, "end_char": 42230, "pages": "10-11", "keywords": ["possessed woman of calcia necromantic formula and death of the monk at perusium"], "verbatim": "\nOne sees that the ancient idea of magic and counter\u2011magic underlies this report. What the fingers of the dactyls, brooding mischief, had bound to the left side, the fingers of the right again loosened, preparing good fortune, and thus good and ill kept equal balance. So here it was words, formulas, and the relics of a child that had bound the possession; but the power of fire was to unravel the knotted thing as a counter\u2011charm. The Church, rightly, has not adopted this doctrine; she has not wished to regard the exorcism and her aid as merely a counterpart to witchcraft, lying on the same level with it; but rather as the higher thing, lying above magic and counter\u2011magic, because rooted in God; and in advancing unerringly along the appointed path she has broken the one and rendered the other unnecessary.\n\nSimilar things have at times occurred in other cases. A woman from Calcia was possessed on the eve of the Feast of Our Lady of the Snows. They took the sufferer to Valombrosa, and Hieronymus of Raggiolo himself exorcised her there; but her demon remained silent for a long time. Then a stranger monk, well versed in necromancy, happened to come by and begged to be allowed to speak something into the mouth (ear) of the possessed woman. He was permitted, and he delivered his speech. Immediately the demon looked at him threateningly and burst out with the words: \"Hypocrite and flatterer, not a brother, but a corrupter! How dare you in this holy place, with evil art, force him whom God has not yet forced? You would rue it on the spot, if what you bear on your breast were your work.\" The monk answered: \"I do not fear your threats!\" The demon then formally challenged him, and the challenge ran to the Alps or elsewhere, wherever it pleased him; \"you will not reach Perusium without having felt my power!\" When the monk on his journey had come to the Perusinian lake, he sat down, weary, beneath an olive tree on the bank of the water. In a short while a black vapor and smoke rose from the waves, wrapped him completely in night and shape, and then lifted itself into the air. The monk died, probably of fright, in Perusium. (The word he had spoken into the woman's ear was probably the formula: Exi daemon quia Ephimolei tibi praecipiunt!) For, according to necromantic tradition, these words have the power, in distinguishing possession from falling sickness, to act healingly upon it. If the possessed person falls, having heard the formula, and drops senseless, but after some time rises again and relates what has just happened --- proclaiming things true and unknown --- then he ought to be freed; but if nothing of the kind occurs, then it is the falling sickness that is afflicting him.

An old woman who was brought to Valombrosa was there severely tormented; at times, however, she would break out into jest and laughter, during which she would then recite the Creed and other chants, in the manner of priests not badly sang. At last the sorely pressed demon cries out from her: If what she hides beneath her dress is not taken away, I cannot go out. It is found, and all the monks saw it with their eyes; it was an amulet marked with various signs, letters and words in the corners, set in wax and bound about with ribbons. Among the words were also Gog and Magog, the Tetragrammaton, Adonai and Sabaoth. It was burned, and the demon came forth with a great noise. It was not Gog and Magog that held him bound; but in all probability it was her intention, which the woman, in the agitation of all her powers, had directed to it, and which now formed the knot by which she "}, "Possession of the Girl from Citt\u00e0 di Castello and Demon\u2019s Accusation of a Priest": {"start_char": 42841, "end_char": 44338, "pages": "11", "keywords": ["- girl from citt\u00e0 di castello"], "verbatim": "It is found, and all the monks saw it with their eyes; it was an amulet marked with various signs, letters and words in the corners, set in wax and bound about with ribbons.

Thus a girl from Citt\u00e0 di Castello becomes possessed. At times she is perfectly quiet and calm, at other times she wants to kill herself with a sword, and she attacks others with nails and teeth.

We have already, on the occasion of the sect that worked in the north of Germany, cited what was believed there of their gift for miracles. C\u00e6sarius has adduced another example concerning this, which clearly expresses the opinion of the time about miraculous power, and its relation to the ecclesiastical. \\[Page 21\\]\n\nAt the time, he says, when the heresy of the Albigenses first began to make itself known, some of the evil sort, strengthened by the power of the devil, wrought certain wonders and signs which not only confirmed the heretics but also seduced many faithful. They walked, among other feats, upon the water, and did not sink. When a priest, honest in faith and religious disposition, perceived this, and reflected that true signs could not stand with a false doctrine, he carried the Body of the Lord in a pyx to the river where these people were performing their powers before the people, and spoke aloud in the hearing of all present: I adjure you, Satan, by Him whom I hold here in my hands, that you cease, on this river, to exercise such conjuring to the corruption of these people! After these words, when the false teachers went on, as before, to walk upon the waves, the priest, thereby agitated, cast the Body of the Lord into the flood.

The same appears in another account preserved by his contemporary Cantipratanus. When M. Conrad preached in Germany against the heretics, where he also suffered the martyr's death, one of them, as I heard from Brother Conrad, the Dominican provincial in Germany, being led astray by demons, sought to win over a brother of the same order to the heresy. But when he perceived the brother's violent resistance he said to him: \"You are very stubborn in your faith, of which, however, you know only some things from Scripture; but if you were to give me your belief, I would by actual sight show you Christ, his mother, and the saints themselves.\" The brother suspected a deception of the demon, but, because he wished to try what was true in the matter, he said: \"I would with good reason give you belief if you could accomplish that.\" The heretic rejoiced at this, and set a day for the meeting; the brother, however, took the Sacrament of the Body of Christ secretly under his cloak with him. The heretic now led the brother into the cave of a mountain, into a spacious, light-filled palace. As they entered the interior of the castle they saw thrones set there as of the purest gold, upon which sat a light-encircled king and a queen arrayed in serene beauty; at her side were chairs of the elders, who, like patriarchs and apostles, surrounded her in the midst of the angels; everything shone so that it seemed anything but demonic. When the introducer beheld them, he fell on his face and worshipped them. The brother, however, stood unmoved, astonished at the spectacle before his eyes. Then the heretic turned to him and said: \"Why do you not worship the Son of God whom you see before you? Come forward, and, paying him homage, receive from his mouth the mysteries of our faith!\" The brother then came nearer, drew out the pyx, and offered it to the queen who sat on the throne, saying: \"Are you indeed the queen and mother of Christ?

The heretic, however, terrified by the marvelous guile of the demon, returned to the faith.\n\nEven more fully is the narrative preserved for us in the form in which Picus of Mirandola gives it. In the Rhaetian Alps, about twelve years earlier, there was a pious priest who, being summoned to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist to a sick man and the road being long, mounted a horse and, after hanging the pyx with the sacrament about his neck, rode on his way. After riding for a while someone met him who invited him to dismount from the horse so that, in his company, he might witness a wonderful spectacle. The parish priest, out of curiosity, imprudently followed the invitation, and had hardly alighted from his horse when he felt himself borne through the air with his companion. After a short while they stood on the summit of an exceedingly high mountain, in a wide, exceedingly lovely plain, bordered by the noblest trees and enclosed by dreadful rocks. Beneath the trees they found ring-dances winding and divers sorts of games, tables laden with costly foods; they heard sounds and songs full of every loveliness; whatever could delight the mind and gladden the heart was present there in abundance. \\[Page 23\\]\n\nThe simple, good clergyman, astonished at the unexpected sight, and, from wonder, daring neither to speak nor to move, stood there as if stunned and out of his senses. Then the companion who had brought him said: would he not venerate the queen present, and visit her with a gift? She sat on a high throne, dressed in royal adornment; all those present approached her, two or four at a time and in perfect order prostrating themselves before her, and paying her homage while presenting gifts. The clergyman, when he thus perceived her in the radiance of her glory, surrounded by many, believed: it was the Mother of the Lord, the Queen of Heaven and Earth; and he had no inkling that anything demonic was hidden behind her. Considering to himself what he should present to her as a gift, he thought: he could bring her nothing dearer or more pleasing than the body of her Son. So he went up to her, and, as he fell at her feet, he took the little case with the Sacrament, which he had hung about his neck, and laid it in the woman's lap. Wonderful! Everything vanished at once. The man, struck by this, now recognized how he had been ensnared by false signs and wonders; and when he found himself abandoned in the gloom of dense forests, he cried to God for help with trembling, that He would deliver him from such dangers. After having wandered for a long time astray and about in the woods, he at last found a shepherd who informed him that he was some hundred miles from the place where he had wished to"}, "Knight at the Crossroads Sees and Speaks with the Devil from Within a Magic Circle": {"start_char": 84409, "end_char": 88367, "pages": "25-26", "keywords": ["knight at the crossroads sees and speaks with the devil from within a magic circle"], "verbatim": "\\[Page 24\\]\n\nThis idea here is the conviction of the magical powers of the heretics, as formerly of those of heathenism; powers which, before the force of truth that, if need be, pours forth miracles from the Church, can never endure. The miraculous gift of the false doctrine, however, manifests itself here by deceitfully clothing evil with borrowed splendor, making it appear as something good; a deception which then dissolves at the approach of truth. It can also make itself known in another way, by letting this evil consist in its terror and dreadfulness, yet presenting it as a power that, though fearsome, is bound to it. From this mode there then sprang another class of tales, which extends from the invocations of the demon in front of the circle of the necromancer to the necromancer's relations with it; a root of legend that has burst forth in many shoots and that connects itself with the historical in manifold entanglements. \\[Page 25\\]\n\nCaesarius thus relates: a knight, who could not be convinced of the reality of demons, had urgently entreated a cleric, who was very proficient in necromancy, that he would show him some. This man, after having strongly admonished him, at last --- once he had obtained a safeguard for every contingency --- led him at noon to a crossroads. There he drew a circle around him with his sword, and then warned him: that in his absence he should not make the sign of the cross, give or promise anything to the demanding spirits, nor by terror or encouragement be induced to bring even a limb of his body out of the circle, because otherwise he would be dead; after this he went away. The knight sat for a while in the circle, when he perceived the inundation of many waters coming toward him; he heard the roaring of furious winds, then the grunting of many swine; but none of this could frighten him. Soon, however, he saw in the nearby wood a dreadful shape, like the shadow of a man, coming toward him over the trees, and understood that it was the Devil. The figure stopped at the circle, and asked him what he wanted. It was to be compared to a great, exceedingly black man, clad in garments of the same color, and so hideous that the knight could not bear to look at it. Meanwhile he said to the coming one: You come to me at the right time, for I have asked to see you. --- For what? --- I have heard much of you. --- What have you heard? --- Much evil, little good! --- The Black (one) replied: Often people judge without cause; I have injured no one without being provoked; therefore ask your master, who is my friend, whether I have ever done him any harm; I do what pleases him, and he commands me in all things. The knight, however: Where were you when I called you? The answer: I was as far beyond the sea as the distance from here to the sea; therefore it will be fair that you reward me somewhat for my trouble. Now he first demands his cloak; on his refusal then the belt, then a sheep from the flock, lastly the cock of his yard, that it should crow for him. But when he refused him everything, he stretched his arm toward him; so that the knight, shrieking, recoiled; whereupon the master ran up and made the specter disappear. Another man, who allowed the same master to show him the demon, was not so fortunate. He let himself be terrified, was drawn out of the circle, and so treated that he died on the third day. In a third tale it is Swabian and Bavarian students who make the attempt in Toledo. Before the circle the spirits appear in the form of armed bands of warriors, who play at war and with lances and swords try to frighten them from their security. Then they change into beautiful girls, who practice all the arts of seduction to lure them out. They all, however, remain steadfast except one, who is enticed to put a finger into the ring which one of these sirens offers him; he is therefore pulled out and disappears.

He had given himself up, by constant association, to learned but unbelieving people, magicians, and men of similar ilk, who initiated him into their arts and doctrines and infected him with their evil habits. He, who now wished to put into practice what he had learned theoretically, in order thereby to satisfy his desires --- which he could not accomplish without demonic help --- allowed himself to be carried away by them to give himself over to him who granted them and to his service, and in turn to seduce others to that service. The relationship had already continued for a good number of years, when one night he was so badly mistreated and almost strangled by him to whom he had given himself, that --- since even his mother had pleaded to God in prayer for that reason --- against his will he resolved to return to God and to call for His help.\n\nPartly on the advice of his elders, partly through the encouragement of Father Carolus von Belitri, Vicar of the Holy Office in Tarvis, finally determined, he betook himself, as to a safe place, to the house of the Office with that vicar, as to a friend. He was now to go there to confession, and for that purpose a pious and discerning theologian was chosen; who, finding him by no means sufficiently prepared, took every pains to bring out what was still lacking by his exhortation and to examine his conscience in a fitting manner. But behold, at that moment his evil spirit again began to seize upon all his senses, and repeatedly to call out from his mouth: I, I am Satan; I, I am this man's lord and owner; he, he may not and cannot make his confession, and I will never permit it. By virtue of the pact which he has concluded with me, he is bound to me and belongs to me; he has solemnly promised me to obey me in all things, never to make a proper confession, nor ever to forsake me. The clergyman was at first frightened by this speech, but then, strengthened in the Lord, he asked the speaker what he wanted here. Thereupon the instigator of all evil answered: This man is the worst scoundrel, who has long consorted with unbelievers, still possesses many of their books, and is always ready for every evil; since he therefore does not commit as much evil as his baseness and wickedness prompt him to, I remain here to watch over him. Thus and the like said the crafty guardian who had plunged him into the abyss of all vices, and who now vaunted himself to be guarding him against greater evil. But when the priest ceased to speak of things that concerned his soul's salvation and turned to indifferent matters, the voice likewise at once ceased to speak through him, and did not hinder him in the use of his senses and faculties. Yet when another time the priest exhorted him with exorcisms not to hinder his confession any longer, the man burst into a furious laugh, and, with face, mouth, and fists, attacked the exorcist, mocking and scoffing at him, so that he appeared utterly mad. If the clergyman desisted a second time, he likewise ceased his rages and his laughter and his taunts, and addressed him seriously and with mature consideration, like a learned and prudent man; asserting at the same time that he from the bottom of his heart cursed all wrongdoing. \\[Page 28\\]\n\nBut as soon as, with his mouth --- the man who spoke these words --- he would renounce these misdeeds, confess them sacramentally in confession, or would name the companions and co\u2011sinners of his vices, he immediately felt his heart bound and pressed; whereupon he then burst forth with the greatest violence and vehemence, and was driven to laughter and ridicule by a power which he could not resist. He confessed that it inwardly determined and carried him away to despise, to deride and to abase the priest who advised him to do penance; and nothing then appeared to him more pleasing and delightful than to hold all religious people and clerics, all clerical ordinations, offices, usages and ceremonies in contempt, to mock them and to trample them underfoot. This did not happen merely once, but whenever he was appointed to any act that could be useful to his soul; especially when, being persuaded by the priest, he was to renounce his errors before the Vicar of the Inquisition. Then he at once broke out into the most violent derisive laughter, and although he strove to drive away force with force, and to write while kneeling and to produce good acts, nothing came of it; he was suddenly overcome by the demon, upset the inkwell, and fled, wrenching himself away with great fury. \\[Page 29\\]\n\nWho can resist referring all this to the evil spirit, which, supported by many years of bad habit, applied every means to assert its right over this its adherent. Not that it possessed him in his body, tormenting and afflicting him like the possessed, without extending its power to their souls. Rather it was, as with all sorcerers and evildoers, always present to him merely as the owner of his soul as well as of his body, and acted according to the circumstances; now in his body binding his heart, contracting it, expanding it, and exciting in it many often opposite passions; then again moving his throat, mouth, tongue, eyes, lips and the other members of the body in many ways; and alternately affecting his internal sensitive powers by diverse objects, as seemed advantageous to it, so that it might hold him forever in its subjection.\n\nNow I, relates Father Brognoli, in the same year, coming from Rome to Bergamo, lodged in a place only a little distance from the city, which that magician inhabited; I was urged by the venerable father\u2011provincial of that reformed province and by the clergyman of whom I have just spoken to take under my charge the aforesaid jurist, whom the clerical exorcists declared to be possessed by the demon, but whom the physicians pronounced insane. When he was brought to me, I first began to speak with him alone about many matters, and I recognized from his speech and answers soon that he was not foolish and out of his senses, as the physicians said, but of very sound understanding, learned, quick of spirit and sharp\u2011witted. Now, however, in the presence of that clergyman and of a noble jurist, his friend, I began to invoke the demon with exorcisms. But the one being exorcised was not, as commonly happens with the possessed, tormented by the exorcisms; instead he burst into laughter and threatened me with his fists. When I had seen this, and remembered the pact that he had concluded with the demon, and how he had already served him for eight years and been devoted to the magical being, I judged it necessary to employ other means.\n\nTherefore, partly urged by himself, partly appointed by the entreaties of his friend, the other legally trained man, as well as by the clerics, to take him more closely under my supervision; I went to the place where he himself lived, had from the Father Inquisitor the necessary authority over him transferred to me, and then, after invoking divine help, in the monastery there, in the presence of our reverend provincial, of a Father Definitor, and of the companion of that man, commanded in the name of our Lord the demon: that they in no way hinder the external or internal faculties and abilities of the person, and that they answer all my questions freely and without obstruction. \\[Page 30\\]\n\nI then asked him for what reason he had turned to our Order, and had especially summoned me, and what he required of me. He answered: So that I might learn whether I am bound by a maleficium, or possessed, or suffer from some other illness. For I feel my heart bound and compressed toward a young man, so that I can scarcely draw breath; and yet I will not break forth into love toward him; but that, I suppose, comes from a maleficium. If therefore you bring out that the evil has its origin in this; then I beg that by your remedies you will restore my health.\n\nWhen from this speech I perceived that he was not moved for the love of God, nor out of sorrow for having offended Him; but, like another Antiochus, willing to give way to the demon in order to avert the scourge from his body, I said to him: I assure you with all the certainty that a servant of Christ and of the Church can have, that if you are struck by a maleficium you shall be healed, on the following three conditions: First, you must obey me in all things that I shall command you, spirituallly or bodily. Secondly, you must reveal to me all the thoughts, words and deeds of your life, as far as possible, and especially from the time onward when you engaged with unbelievers and consorted with demons, up to this hour. Thirdly, you must give ear to the reasons and authorities which I adduce to persuade you of the evangelical truth; and if anything occurs to you in opposition, you must communicate it to me, so that I may resolve your doubts. He promised solemnly in the presence of the clerics and the legally trained man to fulfil all this.\n\nSo that he might not again break into his laughter and mock me, I commanded him on the spot to make the following retractation: \"I, N. N., have learned that whenever I would undertake any act conducive to my healing, I am compelled with the utmost force to laughter, and thus forced to reject all remedies useful to my body and soul. Therefore I declare here on my knees before God, my Creator and Redeemer, and before you, my spiritual father, with all my heart and with my whole soul and with all my strength: that if from this moment I laugh, or perform any act which is meant to express scorn and contempt, I do then laugh Beelzebub, the prince of the demons (so he called him to whom he had devoted himself), to scorn and derision, as do all his adherents; because they, out of pride, have abandoned their God, and, yielding themselves to eternal punishment, have forgotten Him.\" \\[Page 31\\]\n\n\"I will likewise laugh for joy that God, in the infinite fullness of his mercy and goodness, has forgiven me all my sins, which, whenever I laugh, I every time from my whole heart denounce; for they are insults against my God, Creator and Redeemer, whom I must love above all. Therefore, you devils, having tempted, moved, and driven me to laughter at your pleasure; yet it shall, according to my intention, always be to scorn you, and to the salvation of my soul!\"\n\nAfter all this had thus been arranged among us, the laughter was suddenly turned to sorrow. From then on, when things holy were spoken of, he never laughed again; rather he seemed seized by the deepest pain and the blackest melancholy. Wherefore I begged the others to leave us, so that I remained alone with him, and then questioned him about everything he had done and what had happened to him: about the pact he had concluded with the demon; about the confession he had made to him; his promises, accomplices; about the books of the heretics; his master H\u00e4mmerlein; about his presence at the Sabbath, and all that there is done there by the sorcerers, the lords and demons; the pleasures and the magnificences that he had obtained from the demon; finally, about everything that had occurred during the eight years that he had served him --- all of which he told me, albeit with some difficulty.\n\nHe said how, a year earlier, before he had bound himself to the demon, he had had much intercourse with magicians and malefactors, among whom there had been Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Manichaeans, but for the most part atheists; and how he then set himself to the study of their books and teachings. Then first he came to renounce God; and now he found himself prepared to perform everything necessary for the demonic confession. As to the initiation, he reported that it had proceeded thus: the act took place in the year 1638, in a cave of the Genoese mountains, to which he had traveled with nine other magicians, in the company of all the heretics with whom he had then been staying in a certain city on account of his studies.\n\nWhen they arrived at the appointed place they had found the demon there in human shape, sitting upon a stone; with fire-spraying eyes, a goat's beard, horns, clawed hands, ox-like feet; with a hoarser, thinner, but terrible voice. At his sight they all fell down with their burning pitch-torches, which they carried in their hands, and paid him homage by kissing his hindparts. Then the first magician rose from their circle and, while the others remained on their knees, addressed the seated one, setting forth how he brought a new novice to him --- a learned doctor of both laws, likewise well-instructed theologian, whom he presented here and begged him to receive among his own.\n\nThe Prince of Darkness, pleased thereat, answered that the neophyte should present his wishes. He replied: \"My wish is that you show me a treasure and the way to raise it; also that you use no deception or other trick upon me, but provide me with true gold and silver. Then you should teach me the art of going and walking invisibly to wherever my lust and desire strive. Furthermore, the demons that I call should not refuse to comply with my wishes, and should bring me everywhere I wish with the greatest speed, and perform everything that I demand of them.\" \\[Page 32\\]\n\nThe demon then said: All this is easy, if he first renounce God and firmly believe that there is no other God than him, the demon; renounce the remaining articles of faith, the sacraments and sacramentals; all his life hold religious and clerical persons in contempt and deride them; regard all clerical rites as null, never go to confession, and consider that confession itself as an invention of the priests to deceive the simple. The novice promised to observe all of this exactly, except the first. \"That there is no other God but the demon\" contradicts my reason, which bids me the contrary, he said. Then the most distinguished of the magi, who among them was regarded as a kind of bishop, took the mediation upon himself, addressing the newcomer with the words: If you will not immediately believe as I do that there is no god but the demon, then at least believe: there are two gods, one, the Creator of the invisible and spiritual things; the other, the demon, founder of all corporeal and visible things. The novice answered: I can readily give my belief to that.\n\nThus were now the Lord, the Holy Virgin, the sum of all articles of faith, sacraments, clerical rites and ceremonies abjured; and to the demon, after repeated kisses, fidelity was pledged, the confession made; and over all this a written bond was drawn up and sealed by the magician's own hand. He then received from the prince of demons a Martinet or Martinell assigned to him, so that it should be at his hand everywhere. This one, in company with the Martinelli of the other magi, brought before them a splendid carriage drawn by four white camels; which the whole magical society mounted, and was then borne with the greatest speed before sunset to the city which they inhabited. He told all this not jokingly, but in full seriousness; adding that he had earlier communicated it to the reverend inquisitor, before whose tribunal he had appeared, indeed with his mouth but not with his heart: all in accordance with what Petrus of Abano left in his writings. Moreover he said he was ready to abjure all these errors from full conviction.\n\nHe then went on to say: he had been led by the demons to England, France, Germany, and had in Trento, Bergamo, Briren, Verona and in many other cities, together with other sorcerers, attended the gatherings, and again related this all in earnest. Fully in his senses he also told me: We magi and necromancers, when we do not wish to go to such nocturnal assemblies ourselves, then our art teaches us to draw certain necromantic circles, by murmuring a few words, to summon certain demons, and to offer certain adorations to their chief; then we are relieved of being present there and of the labors connected with it, and the demon appears on our behalf. Thus I myself have often acted, by making the circles in my room and adding the rest; yet at other times I have also attended the Sabbath in nearly all the cities of the Venetian territory. \\[Page 33\\]\n\nThe women, however, and the magi of low rank, since they do not possess the higher knowledge, are obliged to appear at every assembly, unless they can produce a sufficient, truly excusing cause. At the third hour of the night the Martinelli assemble; then their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must also be present. Those who come too late or not at all are, wherever they are, struck with illnesses, and are tormented not only during the night of the celebration but also for the following days in body and soul: so that everything they undertake comes to nothing in their hands, until they swear an oath to be more attentive in future.\n\nIn order not to be recognized, the more distinguished and wealthy persons in particular appear covered with a mask, a net, or a veil, which he confirmed by repeated testimony. They would also, for the same reason, not appear under their own proper names. Instead they are called by the names of their native towns, or even of foreign places, with the addition of another place-name, e.g.\u00a0Brescia of Venice, Palatiolum of Milan, when several belonged to the same place.\n\nWhat is told of the pitch-torches at these festivals, of the offerings that each brings, &c.\u00a0he confirmed all from experience; and, asked what he himself sacrificed, he answered: the blood of menstruating women, which the witches of his place supplied to him, and which seemed to be especially pleasing to the demon. He added: the commanding demon of the city where he lives is called Beelzebub; and he has 20,000 demons disposed to every sort of evil under his rule. To himself, however, by virtue of his magical insight, full dominion over the demons had been granted at his will; and he could, by a ring or by some other instrument, bind them and use them for his purposes; but he would neither be used nor forced by them. For all who truly possess magic could, by the power of that art, summon the demons, tame them, make them do their will, and enclose them in rings, vessels, and the like. \\[Page 34\\]\n\nWhen I, says Brognoli, exposed to him the folly of this fancy, he replied one day that he would give me a proof of his power, and by his necromantic circles summon the 30,000 demons that served him. I, for my part, answered: I will for that purpose on the following day, with God's help, preserve myself in the power of Him and of the name of Jesus, to whom sufficient authority and efficacy have been given to put all demons to flight. At that time he lived in the house of the Inquisition, directly beneath the sitting-room of the Inquisitor, Carlo of Velitri. On the following night the latter, as well as one of his friends from the laity, in the room where the magician was alone, heard much speech of the demons; it seemed to come from a great assembled multitude, in which all cried out confusedly, raged in fury, blasphemed God, and boasted how they would do me to death; which they twice attempted that night, yet each time were driven off from my cell by a fear that came over them. By this noise and the shouting which they raised, the Inquisitor and his companion were filled with great terror; and both dared not go to the door of the room in which the magician lived, until I came, and, trusting in divine help, entered the room, and thereby impressed upon him the powerlessness and weakness of the demons. The same was also attested to me by his grown brother, who told me how he had very often heard the voices of many speakers, although the sick man had been alone in the room or in the stable of his house, who, under loud laughter, blasphemed God; which each time caused him the greatest fright.\n\nThe same man, a serious person, also solemnly declared that the brother was heard on almost every night uttering dreadful blasphemies against God, and mocking and deriding Him; which he himself, when I afterwards asked him about it, admitted, adding that he cast them forth in his inward wrath, roused by the violent passion that filled his heart against that young man, and from which he could only free himself by such outbursts. All of that then led directly to atheism, to which several of the magicians with whom he associated daily, according to his own statement, professed themselves.\n\nAll this and his whole remaining behaviour left little hope of his deliverance. I had appointed a day on which he should come to Mass and make the beginning of a sacramental confession. He promised everything; but the demon produced a stiffness and numbness in his body, so that it seemed to him as if it were cold, hard and earthbound; so that he could not stir himself from his bed. After two days I visited him, reproaching him for not having come at the appointed hour. He replied, \"Excuse me, for I cannot rise from the bed nor move from the spot; yet I am content and satisfied and feel no sort of pain.\" When I thereupon commanded the demon not to hinder him, he rose immediately and went to our cloister. But when he wished to confess his sins, there was not the smallest sign of sorrow or inwardness to be perceived in him; which occurred repeatedly over the course of the month. He several times appeared ready to make his confession, and said, \"My offences grieve me in my heart,\" although he was not in a state to show any outward contrition. But hardly had he knelt down when it seemed as if the whole act he performed were entirely empty and altogether irrational; and he said he was aware of no mortal sin. After scarcely begun questioning he already stood up, saying, \"I remember no transgression at all.\" \\[Page 35\\]\n\nOften, when I sought by wholesome exhortations to prepare him for confession, he immediately broke off the conversation and went away, as if someone had urgently summoned him; which he also did frequently with the Inquisitor. When I reminded him to accuse himself of diabolical magic, the invocation of spirits, and other such crimes, he answered: he could not accuse himself of that, because it was an excellent, holy thing worthy of no reproach; he had a pure conscience, unstained by any crime, nor defiled by any vice; and all that he undertook was permitted and right and holy. If, therefore, he had formed a purpose of repentance, the matter was always turned by the demon to the contrary; because his purpose never aimed at God, but at the removal of the bodily evil with which he felt afflicted.\n\nHe told me this often in the words: \"I do not want you to cleanse my conscience by confession; for we magicians and necromancers are all sure of our salvation, and do not need confession; because contrition is sufficient for us, as Peter of Abano teaches us in his writings. I therefore ask only that you free me from the maleficium, should such a thing have struck me.\" Thus he referred everything solely to his bodily health, and no desire arose in him to attend to his spiritual health in order to cure himself of the illness that kept him down. After I had dealt with him for a month he was, for the time being, dismissed home by the Inquisitor. With the increase of this illness he, despairing of any cure, wished to put an end to his own life.\n\nSince he could not leave the bed on which he lay, he incessantly called to those present: Give me a sword or a dagger, with which I can quickly remove myself from the world! Why do I delay any longer? I need only a rope to hang myself. So wills my patron, to whom I have given and devoted myself wholly and entirely; to whom, with body and soul, by virtue of the concluded covenant from which I cannot free myself, I belong! He often made similar speeches, and would have carried them into effect had not someone kept watch over him day and night, as a worthy priest who saw him often at that time testified to me.\n\nIn the year 1667, nineteen years later, when his book was to be printed in Venice, Brognoli asked another priest, who was his countryman, whether he was still alive; and this man replied: I believe so, but I have not seen him for a long time; for years now he has lain bound in chains, naked, covered all over with hair, and entirely without sense. For one day, when he, with some of his companions, outside the city, was performing his necromantic circles to summon the demons, and in some respect erred against his art, the spirits rose up against him and beat him with cudgels all over his body, and especially upon the head, so that he was scarcely carried away half dead by his companions; from those blows he afterwards entirely lost the use of his reason, and became more senseless than an animal. Thus had happened to him what I had often foretold him, when I begged and entreated him to return to sound reason.\n\nIf one considers more clo"}, "Manichaean Demon\u2011Cult Rites, Cannibal Communion, And A Prophetic Demoniac": {"start_char": 121107, "end_char": 130376, "pages": "37-39", "keywords": ["manichaean demoncult rites cannibal communion and a prophetic demoniac", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "This touched directly upon that question earlier debated among the Genoese. \"The exclusive godhood of the demon contradicts my reason,\" replies the novice, refusing to make such a profession. In truth this doctrine could hardly have pleased Manichaeism, because it rested on the denial of all that is spiritual, and would soon have to threaten even Satan himself in his existence. The chief magician, who was regarded as a bishop among the others, therefore stepped forward as mediator; and although he himself professed that doctrine, he permitted the novice to hold to it at his pleasure so long as he seriously acknowledged the duality of the divine being: one invisible who created spiritual things, and another who created the visible, corporeal things. \\[Page 37\\]\n\nBoth, however, are Manichaean doctrine, as Pfellus found in the last half of the eleventh century among the Euchites or Enthusiasts, a Manichaean sect in Thrace. According to his account these took a Father and two Sons as principles. They left the government of the super-world to the Father; of the sons, the younger had the dominion of the heavenly, the elder that of the underworld. In accordance with this threefold principle they themselves again divided into three parts. Some paid divine veneration to both sons at once, because they were, although often not in agreement, nevertheless children of the same father and would once more be received into grace. Others worshipped the younger only as lord of the higher region, without, however, refusing the older his honor, which they did not withhold for fear of harm from his power. Those among them who attained to the highest godlessness entirely renounced the service of that heavenly one and turned all their veneration to the elder, whom they called Satanaki and the firstborn, alienated from the Father, and acknowledged as the author of plants, animals and all composite bodies, together with all corruption and degeneration. To honor him especially highly, they impute to the heavenly all injustice: he envies his brother and persecutes him, who governs the earthly well, with the bitterest hatred, arousing earthquakes, hailstorms and famine; wherefore they, among all other imprecations, also utter that shameful anathema against him. \\[Page 38\\]\n\nThis Satanaki was also present at the initiation in the cave; how much of that was capricious and how much derived from traditionally transmitted, magically visionary practice cannot be determined from the account. Psellus likewise relates: the demons promised gold, possessions and honours, all of which they were in fact unable to provide. To the initiated they often presented many phantasms and fiery displays of light, which they dared to call theoptia or divine visions; and to obtain these they were obliged to undergo every shameful and abominable thing. He then speaks of the solid and liquid excrements of mankind, which they were bound to taste, because that made the demons favourably disposed toward them. He then explains their secret sacrifice. On the evening of the day on which we celebrate our Lord's Passion they would be brought into a house; there, with lights extinguished, all would intermingle without distinction. After the lapse of nine months they would then meet again in the same place. Four days after the birth the children would be taken from their mothers, all their blood drained off, and they would be burned alive on a pyre; the blood was then mixed with the ashes, and with that they contaminated food and drink, and that was their communion. They believe that thereby the symbols impressed on our soul are driven out and obliterated, so that the demons can gain access to it.1) All their deeds and endeavours are indeed directed to making the demons visible to them.\n\nLater he also speaks of some among them who possessed a prophetic spirit. One of these, speaking of him in an assembly of his own people, once said: \"Know that a man will be sent against us who will persecute our faith and abolish its customs! He will, like many others, put me also in chains; yet, however much he may toil, it will not succeed in bringing me hence bound to Byzantium.\" He described me at that time down to the very countenance, clothing and everything; and that at a time when I had not even passed the suburbs of Byzantium. When I had indeed captured him and asked him whence he had his gift of prophecy, at first he would not answer; but finally, forced to speak, he said that he had learned his arts from a wandering Libyan. This man, he related, led him at night to a mountain, made him taste of an herb, then spat into his mouth, anointed his eyes with an ointment, and caused him to see a multitude of demons, among whom he perceived one that flew toward him in the shape of a raven and entered through his mouth into his entrails. From that time until the present day he could look into the future, as often and in all matters as pleased his demon. Only on the days of the Cross and of the Passion, and on the day of the Resurrection, does he never, even if I wish it, reveal anything to me. But when one of the men struck one of them on the mouth, he said to him, \"You will pay dearly for this one blow!\" and, turning to me, \"but you will suffer much misfortune in your body! For the demons whose service you have overthrown are very hostile to you, and have brought upon you dangers which you will not escape unless a power higher than theirs frees you from them.\" And all came to pass as he had foretold, and I narrowly met death in the many dangers that surrounded me, from which, contrary to expectation, the Redeemer delivered me.\n\nThe ways of the Abomination --- on which, in the deep Orient, they knew how to prepare the sacrament of Hell, under sin and homicide, and the bread of the abyss which, whoever has tasted it, attaches him to the nether-realm and, as we heard elsewhere, never lets him recover --- these ways had also been opened in the peninsula of the West; the deep had foamed its venom into the food, and the unhappy Manichaean had sat at its table. Now the trunk of the good, which springs up in man, had not, as if struck by frost, cast off its green leafy adornment; the axe had not cut away its branches and shortened the trunk itself down to the ground: the stump left behind would then still have been able to put forth new shoots. No --- the last root of what was better had been torn up, the last living germ killed; the higher symbols were all extinguished, and to the dreadful night of death that had now fallen the demons had free access; and the seed of evil, buried down in the depths, could now develop freely.\n\nHe was not possessed, now, in the manner in which possession is commonly understood --- an involuntary entanglement with the hostile power, therefore bound merely in the body; rather the soul had surrendered itself in full deliberation, and from it the body was then occupied with its full knowledge and will. The bird of darkness had flown down through his opened mouth into the depths of his heart, and there, finding already the culpable inclination for that youth, had fastened itself to it and made it the center of his whole being. Thus it was he himself who had committed the evil deed, while his suspicion clung continually to others; just as he, thinking himself the possessor of the demons, became possessed by them. Precisely because a reversal of his whole being had taken place, no notion of his condition remained to him; because no object, not even God, was present to him by which, through comparison, he might find his bearings. The ground of his condition appeared to him good and right, for he believed himself to be perfectly oriented; he was certain of his salvation in it. Only a small flaw disturbed his happiness --- the supposed enchantment with the youth, to which he endeavored to attach all the contradictions into which his perverse state had entangled him with the proper order of things. When, at night, one abyss within him called to another, and a hundred voices spoke blasphemies and vented their despair, then he found in their fury a relief for his flaming passion, and believed that it merely poured itself out there. The bondage of his body when the physician approached him, the grim mocking laugh that burst from him, and the grief that possessed him --- it was all, as he knew, the consequence of his own doing; his caprice, however, had only surrendered to vicissitudes; another power, which continued itself alone in his will, had made the choice.\n\nThis power had bound him with fetters of necessity, and this necessity was not the expression of a power that binds in love under the law of order; but of a violence, hating and destroying in the division of lawlessness, that compelled him to all evil. Thus he was the true canon of a condition that will hereafter meet us more often; a condition that united him intimately with everything that in any way created evil on earth. \\[Page 39\\]\n\nHe therefore attended all the Sabbaths of the brethren, but with the unboundness of a high magnate of the realm, coming and going according to his pleasure, as it pleased him.

For by the poison which she hurled upon him, Satan has gained a permanent assault upon man. Great therefore is the power permitted to Satan by God over the world; the Satanim dwell with man and beside him, and mock him; and their purpose is to do him harm, and they pursue his blood.\n\nNot only does Satan draw to himself those who voluntarily surrender to him; he also persecutes the pious, and disturbs their well-being by the Ruach Thesa\u1e63\u1e63ith, the spirit of confusion or possession. The man in whom such an evil spirit has entered does everything he does and says by the inspiration of the evil spirit that is in him. Thus it was also with the serpent in the case of Eve: all that she did and spoke came from Samael. In the city of Ferrara a Jewish woman was thus possessed; she fell into a stupor, and a voice issued from her throat while her lips were without movement, and the voice spoke. In the time of Luria there was a widow into whom a Ruach had entered, and it inflicted extraordinary torments upon her. People went to her, spoke with her, and received answers to what they asked. The relatives of the woman came to Loriah, and begged him that he would drive the Ruach out of the woman. Loriah sent his pupil R. Chaim Vital, and gave him certain holy names with him, and told him what intention he was to observe in the matter. He also commanded him that he should pronounce over the Ruach the small and great ban, and should by force drive it out. When R. Chaim came to the woman, she turned her face away from him. R. Chaim said: Why do you turn away? The Ruach answered: I cannot look you in the face. Then R. Vital commanded that it must turn around, which immediately happened. He now asked the spirit: who are you? whereupon it related its former criminal life. It said it had formerly been a Jew, and had already been wandering in the world for twenty\u2011five years, incessantly pursued by three angels of destruction. Vital further asked: who gave it permission to enter the woman? The Ruach said: I was in the house when the woman rose in the morning and wanted to strike a fire.

In Spain, since the conquest by the Saracens, they were continually accused of collusion with the enemy of Christendom. In the year 1321 letters were said to have been found in France in which the King of Granada reported to the Jew Samson that he had loaded three pack animals with riches and poisons to poison the waters with them, and had sworn to them as reward to carry them back into the Promised Land.

An enormous terror fell upon them, and by the hundred thousands they went over to Africa, Greece, Romania, Egypt and Babylonia; others fled to Portugal, France, Italy, Germany; many perished in shipwreck or at the hands of pirates: it was a calamity greater than that which they suffered in the time of Titus and Hadrian, and it even stirred the compassion of Christians toward them.\n\nIn the century that ran from 1394, when Charles VI likewise again drove them out of France, to this catastrophe, we again find the child\u2011murders reappearing with force, and now by means of judicial inquiry taking on a more documentary character. Outstanding among them, above many others, is the story of the boy Simon, who was born in Trento in the year 1472 of poor parents, and in the year 1475 found his death at the hands of the Jews. At the instigation of the old Moses, who was reputed to be a seer, knowing the day and hour of the Messiah's coming, their elders---Tobias, Angelus and Samuel, in whose house the synagogue was---had resolved to sacrifice a Christian boy at the Easter festival. But since their servants refused the plotted seizure of such a one, Tobias at last undertook it himself, his medical profession giving him the best opportunity to execute the commission. The boy was brought in, hidden for a time in the synagogue, and on the appointed day was most cruelly murdered. The corpse was concealed by the murderers for some time, because the elders searched everywhere for the child with armed men; and finally, as the danger pressed all too near upon the awakened suspicion, it was thrown into the nearby flowing water, and the discovery was then reported to the authorities.\n\nThe bishop ordered the most exacting inquiry; the Schulthei\u00df Johannes and the prefect Jacob de Sporo were appointed as judges; they summoned Archangelus Baldin of Trento, Math(eus) Tiberinus of Brescia, Chr(istus) de Fatis of Turlach, as physicians and surgeons, to report on the condition of the corpse and its wounds, and the report sharpened the grounds for suspicion. The Jews were brought in; they chose the most eminent jurists at the University of Padua as their defenders; their statements contradicted one another, torture finally forced the full confession which---being found to agree completely with the circumstances (one had, for example, also discovered the hidden flask containing the collected blood)---now resulted in the judicial condemnation of the proved perpetrators, the expulsion of the Jews from Trento, and the transformation of the synagogue into a chapel of the miracle\u2011working murdered one. All this is reported by the physician M. Tiberinus in an authentic letter to the senate and citizens of Brescia. The deed had taken place on the night of 23 March; the sentence was executed on 21 June; in the three months between the rumor ran through all Italy. \\[Page 47\\]\n\nOn 22 April the Doge of Venice, P. Mocenigo, issued a mandate; it was believed that the rumor of a boy murdered by the Jews had been invented only for certain purposes; he, however, wished that the Jews should dwell undisturbed and secure in his lands; he therefore forbade any change in their condition, and prohibited preachers and other persons from stirring up the people against them. That was without doubt worthy, just and sensible; but when meanwhile the trial had taken its course and led to the result above mentioned, then a second decree of 12 August of the same year revoked that judgment, permitted the carrying about of the images of the martyr, allowed preachers to treat the deed from the pulpit, but even then forbade them to incite the people against the Jews; because those who were not guilty could not be struck by the punishment. \\[Page 48\\]\n\nIn September the magistrate of Trento wrote a letter to Venice --- still to be found in the archive of St.\u00a0Franciscus de Vinea --- in which he reports the affair in complete agreement with Tiberianus, and among other things says: \"how the judges, although they were deeply moved by the murder, and well recognized the deceit and guile of the Jews, their cunning, their hatred against the Church, and the corrupting power of their gold, nevertheless dealt with them so moderately, with such gravity and such leniency, that whoever runs through the records will rather complain of excessive indulgence and tenderness than of severity. Torture, it is true, finally wrested the truth from them; but after Tobias had first confessed, all, as with one mouth, confirmed the matter with regard to place, time, circumstances, and those who had been present.
