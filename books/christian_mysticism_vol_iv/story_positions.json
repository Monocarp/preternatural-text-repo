When the exorcism was applied, his spirit began to speak and recounted how he, bound by a charm, could not free himself until that charm placed under his threshold was removed. The monks, however, attached no credence to these words and continued with the invocation. The possessed then became entirely furious, and with a wild, burning eye cried out: \"O cross! O torment! what must I endure; for what, you villains, all the praying, and the singing and toil! You well know what I said before.\" Some of those who had brought him into the monastery thought now that one must remove whatever might be found there; the monks, however, prevented anyone from proceeding to the work, so that it should not appear as if they had credited the devil, or that he had only departed after the removal of the charm. They therefore continued calmly and unconcerned with the exorcism; but he now tore himself away from the hands of those holding him, was thrown to the ground by the demon, and tormented as never before. This continued for a while; at last the demon, exhausted and unable to resist further, departed.\n\nBut it was worth the trouble, says Hieronymus, to hear what voices he uttered, even afterwards wandering about in the sanctuary; it would have seemed incredible to me were it not for the credible persons who, as eyewitnesses, gave me an account of everything. Such a clamor and tumult and trembling accompanied the departure that one thought the church and monastery were coming to ruin. Having returned to Florence, the people, disregarding the prohibition in the monastery, searched what lay beneath the threshold, and found a bundled, silk\u2011thread\u2011bound cloth, and in it a piece of the bone of a dead child, a woman's hair, the skin of a donkey's hide, with certain signs and characters written on it, all of which they immediately ga"}, "Possession of Woman from Calcia and Death of Necromancer Monk": {"start_char": 39344, "end_char": 42199, "pages": "10-11", "keywords": ["- possessions in denmark"], "verbatim": "\nOne sees that the ancient idea of magic and counter\u2011magic underlies this report. What the fingers of the dactyls, brooding mischief, had bound to the left side, the fingers of the right again loosened, preparing good fortune, and thus good and ill kept equal balance. So here it was words, formulas, and the relics of a child that had bound the possession; but the power of fire was to unravel the knotted thing as a counter\u2011charm. The Church, rightly, has not adopted this doctrine; she has not wished to regard the exorcism and her aid as merely a counterpart to witchcraft, lying on the same level with it; but rather as the higher thing, lying above magic and counter\u2011magic, because rooted in God; and in advancing unerringly along the appointed path she has broken the one and rendered the other unnecessary.\n\nSimilar things have at times occurred in other cases. A woman from Calcia was possessed on the eve of the Feast of Our Lady of the Snows. They took the sufferer to Valombrosa, and Hieronymus of Raggiolo himself exorcised her there; but her demon remained silent for a long time. Then a stranger monk, well versed in necromancy, happened to come by and begged to be allowed to speak something into the mouth (ear) of the possessed woman. He was permitted, and he delivered his speech. Immediately the demon looked at him threateningly and burst out with the words: \"Hypocrite and flatterer, not a brother, but a corrupter! How dare you in this holy place, with evil art, force him whom God has not yet forced? You would rue it on the spot, if what you bear on your breast were your work.\" The monk answered: \"I do not fear your threats!\" The demon then formally challenged him, and the challenge ran to the Alps or elsewhere, wherever it pleased him; \"you will not reach Perusium without having felt my power!\" When the monk on his journey had come to the Perusinian lake, he sat down, weary, beneath an olive tree on the bank of the water. In a short while a black vapor and smoke rose from the waves, wrapped him completely in night and shape, and then lifted itself into the air. The monk died, probably of fright, in Perusium. (The word he had spoken into the woman's ear was probably the formula: Exi daemon quia Ephimolei tibi praecipiunt!) For, according to necromantic tradition, these words have the power, in distinguishing possession from falling sickness, to act healingly upon it. If the possessed person falls, having heard the formula, and drops senseless, but after some time rises again and relates what has just happened --- proclaiming things true and unknown --- then he ought to be freed; but if nothing of the kind occurs, then it is the falling sickness that is afflicting him. That, then, was the counter-charm the monk had probably intended to use, the application of which, however, turned out so badly for him bec"}, "Possession of Old Woman Bound by Amulet": {"start_char": 42303, "end_char": 43442, "pages": "11", "keywords": ["- possession of johanna 1584"], "verbatim": "\nAt other times it has been amulets to which the spell was tied, even if only in the belief of the bound person; after their removal the release then proceeded more easily.

It is found, and all the monks saw it with their eyes; it was an amulet marked with various signs, letters and words in the corners, set in wax and bound about with ribbons.

When a priest, honest in faith and religious disposition, perceived this, and reflected that true signs could not stand with a false doctrine, he carried the Body of the Lord in a pyx to the river where these people were performing their powers before the people, and spoke aloud in the hearing of all present: I adjure you, Satan, by Him whom I hold here in my hands, that you cease, on this river, to exercise such conjuring to the corruption of these people!

The same appears in another account preserved by his contemporary Cantipratanus. When M. Conrad preached in Germany against the heretics, where he also suffered the martyr's death, one of them, as I heard from Brother Conrad, the Dominican provincial in Germany, being led astray by demons, sought to win over a brother of the same order to the heresy. But when he perceived the brother's violent resistance he said to him: \"You are very stubborn in your faith, of which, however, you know only some things from Scripture; but if you were to give me your belief, I would by actual sight show you Christ, his mother, and the saints themselves.\" The brother suspected a deception of the demon, but, because he wished to try what was true in the matter, he said: \"I would with good reason give you belief if you could accomplish that.\" The heretic rejoiced at this, and set a day for the meeting; the brother, however, took the Sacrament of the Body of Christ secretly under his cloak with him. The heretic now led the brother into the cave of a mountain, into a spacious, light-filled palace. As they entered the interior of the castle they saw thrones set there as of the purest gold, upon which sat a light-encircled king and a queen arrayed in serene beauty; at her side were chairs of the elders, who, like patriarchs and apostles, surrounded her in the midst of the angels; everything shone so that it seemed anything but demonic. When the introducer beheld them, he fell on his face and worshipped them. The brother, however, stood unmoved, astonished at the spectacle before his eyes. Then the heretic turned to him and said: \"Why do you not worship the Son of God whom you see before you? Come forward, and, paying him homage, receive from his mouth the mysteries of our faith!\" The brother then came nearer, drew out the pyx, and offered it to the queen who sat on the throne, saying: \"Are you indeed the queen and mother of Christ? See there your son! If you acknowledge him, then I will acknowledge you as his mother.\" At these words the whole phantom vanished, and after the fading of the brightness so dense a darkness spread that the brother with his guide scarcely found the way out.

In the Rhaetian Alps, about twelve years earlier, there was a pious priest who, being summoned to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist to a sick man and the road being long, mounted a horse and, after hanging the pyx with the sacrament about his neck, rode on his way. After riding for a while someone met him who invited him to dismount from the horse so that, in his company, he might witness a wonderful spectacle. The parish priest, out of curiosity, imprudently followed the invitation, and had hardly alighted from his horse when he felt himself borne through the air with his companion. After a short while they stood on the summit of an exceedingly high mountain, in a wide, exceedingly lovely plain, bordered by the noblest trees and enclosed by dreadful rocks. Beneath the trees they found ring-dances winding and divers sorts of games, tables laden with costly foods; they heard sounds and songs full of every loveliness; whatever could delight the mind and gladden the heart was present there in abundance. \\[Page 23\\]\n\nThe simple, good clergyman, astonished at the unexpected sight, and, from wonder, daring neither to speak nor to move, stood there as if stunned and out of his senses. Then the companion who had brought him said: would he not venerate the queen present, and visit her with a gift? She sat on a high throne, dressed in royal adornment; all those present approached her, two or four at a time and in perfect order prostrating themselves before her, and paying her homage while presenting gifts. The clergyman, when he thus perceived her in the radiance of her glory, surrounded by many, believed: it was the Mother of the Lord, the Queen of Heaven and Earth; and he had no inkling that anything demonic was hidden behind her. Considering to himself what he should present to her as a gift, he thought: he could bring her nothing dearer or more pleasing than the body of her Son. So he went up to her, and, as he fell at her feet, he took the little case with the Sacrament, which he had hung about his neck, and laid it in the woman's lap. Wonderful! Everything vanished at once. The man, struck by this, now recognized how he had been ensnared by false signs and wonders; and when he found himself abandoned in the gloom of dense forests, he cried to God for help with trembling, that He would deliver him from such dangers.

There he drew a circle around him with his sword, and then warned him: that in his absence he should not make the sign of the cross, give or promise anything to the demanding spirits, nor by terror or encouragement be induced to bring even a limb of his body out of the circle, because otherwise he would be dead; after this he went away. The knight sat for a while in the circle, when he perceived the inundation of many waters coming toward him; he heard the roaring of furious winds, then the grunting of many swine; but none of this could frighten him. Soon, however, he saw in the nearby wood a dreadful shape, like the shadow of a man, coming toward him over the trees, and understood that it was the Devil. The figure stopped at the circle, and asked him what he wanted. It was to be compared to a great, exceedingly black man, clad in garments of the same color, and so hideous that the knight could not bear to look at it. Meanwhile he said to the coming one: You come to me at the right time, for I have asked to see you. --- For what? --- I have heard much of you. --- What have you heard? --- Much evil, little good! --- The Black (one) replied: Often people judge without cause; I have injured no one without being provoked; therefore ask your master, who is my friend, whether I have ever done him any harm; I do what pleases him, and he commands me in all things.

Furthermore, the demons that I call should not refuse to comply with my wishes, and should bring me everywhere I wish with the greatest speed, and perform everything that I demand of them.\" \\[Page 32\\]\n\nThe demon then said: All this is easy, if he first renounce God and firmly believe that there is no other God than him, the demon; renounce the remaining articles of faith, the sacraments and sacramentals; all his life hold religious and clerical persons in contempt and deride them; regard all clerical rites as null, never go to confession, and consider that confession itself as an invention of the priests to deceive the simple. The novice promised to observe all of this exactly, except the first. \"That there is no other God but the demon\" contradicts my reason, which bids me the contrary, he said.

A young man, called Jakob, a nephew of my husband, began to be beset with fear by the spirit of temptation. For when he went to bed at evening he began to lament and to cry, and said he could not sleep in his room because of the demon and the ghosts. So we made his bed in ours; but when he lay down there he began again to bewail himself; and when we ran to him his whole bed trembled; and the boy's eyelids were so widely torn apart that they could not be closed or brought together by anyone; his mouth, however, was so tightly shut that no one could open it. After he at last came to himself and began to speak, we asked him how he was. He answered: God knows it; to me it is unknown. At last sleep came over him, so that he rested the remainder of the night, and slept until the tenth hour on the following day. On rising, however, he looked so corpse-pale and emaciated that it was a terror to all. That evening, as he stood at the table during supper, I said to him: Take something to eat, Jakob! Lie down, and commend yourself to God's protection, so that you do not again behave as on that accursed night, whereby we all were thrown into terror, and finally must leave the house! As I spoke these words, the doors of the chamber and the kitchen were torn open of themselves, and so violently that they struck against the walls; the youth, however, was torn from the room into the hall, where he was raised two ells high into the air, hanging suspended; without anyone present who supported him or held him aloft. His arms were stretched up, his eyes wide open, his mouth drawn together, his chin twitched up and down as if it were about to be torn off. \\[Page 82\\]\n\nWe tried with all our strength, grasping him by hands and feet, to pull the one hovering down; but the limbs hung so motionless that we could not even shift him or move him from the spot. We therefore all, kneeling in the hall, called to God that He would remember His mercy. Then the youth was released and set again upon the ground. But his mouth was still closed so that he could not speak, until we made him vomit with a silver spoon. Then he sighed, and his tongue was loosened, and his speech restored; and when we asked him how he was, he said: I hope that, with God's help, I will now grow better; for when you called to God on your knees, he went away, and moved from the well to the wood-pile. When I asked, \"Who has gone?\" he answered, \"Satan.\" When I further asked whether he had then bound himself to Satan, he burst into tears and said, \"You do me a great wrong, mother, in holding me capable of such a crime; my years have not taught me such things!\"\n\nWhile he spoke thus, a great noise was heard in the entry-hall, and a monstrous voice was heard, which however no one understood. The young man said: it is the voice of Satan, who speaks with him. At that moment a great fire flared up in the entry-hall, running about here and there. The young man said: Satan had spat the fire from his throat. We then took him into the room and read to him from God's Word until two o'clock after midnight, whereupon sleep at last came upon him, which lasted until the eleventh hour the next morning. He was, however, soon assailed again, and the terrors in our house increased day by day; all the more because I kept the matter secret until my husband's return. Of him Satan said: he had dogged him for fourteen years, but on account of the great man (so he used to call God), whose assistance he invokes day and night, I could do nothing against him; instead of him you are now delivered to me! The young man wept as he told this, and lamented that he had ever set foot in Denmark; for he was a German, and his temptation by Satan grew worse and worse thereafter.\n\nAt times he crucified him, bowing his head and crossing his feet one over the other, as Christ is represented on the cross: then no one could bend him, or move him from the spot, or alter his stance and appearance; he turned the whites of his eyes outward as if he were dead. At last my blessed husband returned home, and was informed of what had occurred. He caused prayers to be said for us in the town and the neighboring churches. He appointed the three successive Sundays as days of penance for the whole household, on which none, neither man nor beast, should eat or drink anything.\n\nOn the first of those days it was as if Satan would force in the windows, and the young man wailed that he would carry him off through the open window; the Evil One also appeared to some as a raven, to others as a goose. --- For a month the afflicted one had not slept soundly; now he began to enjoy some rest and awoke cheerful; likewise nothing had occurred in the house during the whole night, and the awakened man related that during the night his angels had told him he would get better.

The next morning it was frantic, tried to bite everyone who came to visit us; and we were obliged to kill it. When at last the time came in which the tormented young man was to be freed, he rose in bed and wrestled with Satan, using God's Word for the conflict; he recited many prayers that the neighbors we had summoned listened to; finally he lifted his hands to heaven and cried out: Now be God praised, who has delivered me from Satan! Then, turning to the other side, he extended his hand to someone we did not know and said: Hail to you, angel who standest at the right hand of God; forsake me now never, whether I travel by water or by land! He spoke other such words, reached out his hand again after kissing it; then wrapped himself in his blanket so that we saw nothing but the crown of his head; and we heard him, like a small boy with a clear voice, sing: Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth to men of good will.

My husband now began to be assailed day and night, harder than anyone can imagine; namely from eleven o'clock in the morning and evening until two o'clock after noon and after midnight. It began when I had stayed at home from the Sunday service because of a boy's illness; thereupon such a terror seized us all that we altogether fell upon benches and chairs, or upon the floor. We came to ourselves again, and after we had prayed the evil vanished again. The maids and the children, however, again saw apparitions; and my husband, who had already been sorrowful for three weeks, became all the more downcast when he learned of it. Once, when I adjured him by God to at least tell how he was, he collapsed; and when he came to himself again he said: God, who is always gracious and merciful to those who call on him, may he also be mindful of me and of ours, and bring us help! So sorely am I pressed by Satan day and night that heaven and earth seem to lie upon me with their weight. You will not long have me with you further as a husband, and my children will soon be orphans. From that time on he was harried more and more fiercely; according to his account something lay upon him daily at that hour like a sack of fruit; and at times swellings, as large as hen's eggs, would break out at his side. I again had prayers held in the churches, and also drove by carriage out to Mr.\u00a0Johannes in the parish of Norderup to solicit his assistance. But when, on my return, I entered a wood the carriage became so heavy that the horses could scarcely move it; the trees crashed about us, something as high as a tower rose up before us, and a dreadful voice was heard which we could not understand. When I, having come home, went to bed and, my right hand bowed over my head, fell asleep, it was as if a mouse were gnawing my finger.

But when we rose the next morning, there lay on the lower sheet, from the pillow to the feet, a hanging of filth, two and two as masses united in a link of the chain, as if they had been strung on a thread, and so numerous that one could scarcely see the sheet beneath them. Our neighbors looked on this in amazement. Ingeburg, the wife of Mejer, who had come over, heard a loud laugh but saw no one. When she, frightened, withdrew again, my husband fainted. We brought him to bed, and sat in the front room until the ninth hour; but when I then wished to go to bed, he was no longer in it, and at last we found him in a small room, weeping and lamenting. This continued until it finally ended as the whole affair had begun: in my husband's head-pillow, into which the spirit had thrown itself, and from whose lower side, when it was removed, it had torn a piece out of the covering so that the feathers flew about the whole room. My husband was then freed.\n\nWhen we gave thanks to God for this deliverance in the churches, our nine-year-old son fell ill.\u00a0Yet we could not fathom his sickness; he said something living ran through his body, gnawing at him here and there. We tried baths and other remedies, but he grew worse. A surgeon we consulted likewise could give no explanation, and directed us to a woman versed in healing who at that time visited our town. She said the boy was possessed, and that nothing would help but prayer. Meanwhile, as the boy lay in his willow-woven bed, the bed together with him was lifted two ells into the air and was moved hither and thither. When I therefore called my husband, the boy had meantime been pulled out of the bed and stood on his head, his feet turned upward and his hands outstretched; so that we could hardly get him back into bed. Something continued to run through him; his body sometimes swelled horribly, his tongue was thrust out of his mouth, and then again was wound up like a cloth, while blood pressed through his lips. His limbs were drawn so together that four strong men were not enough to pull them apart. He grunted like a pig, clucked like a cock, and howled like a dog. At times it carried the boy onto the beams of our room, or on a pile of wood, and left him there; so that he did not know where he was and wept bitterly. It also threw him over the wall into the gateway of our neighbor Mejer. Sometimes it drew his eyes and cheeks so far back into his head that they were no longer visible. The boy became rigid like a log, and we set him up in this condition against the wall, where he then stood motionless like a statue; so that even the most hard-hearted were moved to tears at the sight of him.\n\nOnce, when I myself was at the evening sermon on a Sunday, it ill-treated my mother, who had stayed at home; the spirit, taking my likeness, pulled her shoes from her feet and struck her with them. She therefore received me on my return home weeping and with bitter reproaches. Although women the next day assured her to the contrary, she could scarcely be persuaded until the spirit, speaking from the boy's mouth, told my husband about it, adding: Had the Great One permitted it, I would have treated her so that the whole town would have wept for her. When we in the evening prayed the 46th Psalm, he neighed like a horse to it; he spat upon my husband's face so that it ran into his beard. He placed bare knives upon my breast; but when I said he should strike in the name of Jesus, the knives fell to the floor. He said to my husband: Be not too hasty, you will not drive me from here until those who brought me here receive their deserved reward! That is the will of the great man; even if I am a liar, he at times compels me to tell the truth. I would wish the time were already come when I could leave the house. When my husband asked when that time would come, he answered: Only that great man knows, not I.\n\nMy husband, after having borne so much himself and for his family, was now delivered from all misery; he himself passed to the other life, and left me alone, entangled in combat with the raging enemy, who would not cease to speak from the boy's mouth. The affliction continued for two years after my husband's death. Magister Glostrup held prayers for us in the church, often came to our house, spoke with Satan, and reproved him harshly. He also tried to speak with him in Latin; but the reply was: he would not burden his head with Latin. At last God would not permit him to continue his persecutions; he had to desist, and our house became as free from spectres as it had been before --- for which may the holy Name of God be praised, who does not abandon His own in their distress. I have written this down as a memorial of what happened in our house, and it contains, so help me God! the pure truth.\n\nThis is also known to M. N. Glostrup, then our pastor, now Bishop of Opfloe; likewise to P. von Duebrodere, Bartolo Foannis; to Peter Mann in Ferse, to the pastor Jakob in Nordrup, Caspar in Roeschild, Lorenz in Liemarch, Nicolaus in Vallensby --- several of whom still live, others are already dead. Magister Nicolaus had the boy in his house for half a year; the boy afterwards recovered, once the authors of our misfortune had expiated their guilt, and lived until th"}, "Witchcraft Trial of Johanna Thomana in K\u00f8ge": {"start_char": 284787, "end_char": 286973, "pages": "86", "keywords": ["- date of johanna thomana"], "verbatim": "\nOne might, on reading this account, imagine that every member of that worthy family went mad in turn; but it would not be proper to attribute the participation of all the named pastors to the influenza as well. The censor of the book, Fan Berharod, who, after reading it, believes it will help to confirm Scripture's teaching about demons, likewise must not have escaped the contagion. Then there are the two burgomasters of the town, father and son, and the senator Pomeyer, who officially and before God declare to the author Brunsmann that there is no reason to suspect fraud in what is contained in the woman's report; that they have had the truth of the matter confirmed by their predecessors, and that it also appears as such in their records, which they have placed at his disposal; they too must be regarded as having suffered from the same malady.\n\nThe circle of this strange mental disorder grows still wider when one reads the extracts Brunsmann has made from these records. The householder Barscher had taken suspicion of the authors of the mischief in his house, and this suspicion had fallen upon Johanna Thomana, with whom he had formerly been in business relations --- relations he broke off when she was accused, by Christina Capserin (who had been executed for witchcraft), of being implicated. Her grievance had been increased when he had pre-purchased a house on which she had bid. For this reason he had taken an advocate, and by him caused the suit to be prosecuted before the town council. The investigation was instituted and carried out; on 8 June 1612 sixteen judges of guilt were appointed at the Ting of K\u00f8ge, who are named in the records. They were charged to pronounce only such judgment as, according to the laws, they could justify before God and men. From 8 June until the 3rd... \\[Page 86\\]\n\nThe trial lasted through August, during which the lay judges, their hands laid upon the Holy Scripture, declared: As we desire---may God and His holy Word prosper us for good and for salvation---so in this matter we could find nothing otherwise than that Johanna Thomana had been the cause of the mistreatment of the servant in the service of the merchant Joh"}, "Hauntings and Afflictions of the Three Brothers from Rheinbischofsheim": {"start_char": 288438, "end_char": 297667, "pages": "87-89", "keywords": ["hauntings and afflictions of the three brothers from rheinbischofsheim"], "verbatim": "sition into the next consideration.\n\nIn Holy Week, 1836, three brothers of Protestant confession came from Rheinbischofsheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden --- Jakob, David and Friedrich --- bearing a letter from a Catholic parish priest from the Lower-Rhine Alsace, who recommended them for exorcistic treatment because they, their younger sister, and their whole household were continually tormented by evil spirits. From the conversations I had with the three young men in consequence, roughly the following emerged. Descended from common peasant parents and occupied from youth with agricultural work, they had always been healthy and strong. The eldest, Jakob, learned the smith's trade; the second, David, entered service in the army; the third, Friedrich, always remained at home. While Jakob was still abroad, David was one time seized by a very strange condition: he felt as if blown upon by a wind, and such a compression arose on his chest that he began to spit up blood. He was medically treated and was sent to the hospital in Karlsruhe; but all remedies applied were in vain, and he finally received his discharge. Arrived at home, his condition was not at all better, and at the same time extremely strange things happened in the house and in the stable. At the same time Jakob, while abroad, had begun to perceive what was going on in the paternal home; and now the younger brother Friedrich soon also began to be tormented, just like David; and also a younger sister, though not to the same degree as the brothers. In the house there were intermittent rumblings and bangs in a dreadful manner, and in the stable the cattle perished in an unnatural way. When the brothers went across the fields or drove with the cart, stones were often thrown at them from the air. Sometimes, they said, a thunderstorm suddenly stood up in the clearest sky; and on several occasions an unknown animal walked ahead of them and then, at a certain spot, suddenly vanished. \\[Page 87\\]\n\nPhysically Jacob suffered little, but he was a kind of visionary, and saw, as he said, the fiends coming. A moment later the brothers would be as if smitten by a breath, and feel an inner motion that increased to the point of hemorrhage; yet so that, when the attack had passed, they felt their strength restored, as if they had never lacked anything. Often it seemed to them as if they were beaten by invisible but still palpable hands; often as if they were pierced through the belly. They ascribed these things neither to the devil nor to actual spectres, but to wicked people. The seer insisted that he had positively recognized the apparitions as persons still living and even related to them; and the strangest stories were adduced in proof.\n\nThey had at the outset sought diverse medical help, but found none anywhere; what wonder, since they sought to drive out sorcery by sorcery, and went to those who were reputed to practice such arts. These assisted them on several occasions by sympathetic means, but only for a short time; because, as they alleged, the helpers were better paid by the others. What opinion I should draw from all these accounts as to the real ground of the matter I did not know. I regarded the two younger brothers, David and Friedrich, as hysterical; for their condition, especially that of the latter, pointed to a high degree of suffering. They otherwise appeared to be anything but timid, superstitious people; so that, since I noted they were Protestants --- among whom such things, especially in that district, occur even more than among Catholics --- I was inclined to ascribe the whole affair to a play of the imagination; yet on the other hand their calm narration, their ingenuous answers to embarrassing questions which I put to them, utterly disabused me of that view.\n\nAfter I had at last deliberated, and after I had to some extent explained to them the meaning of the church benediction, I gave this to them repeatedly once or twice a day. They testified that they felt easier, indeed they seemed entirely free from their plague. I therefore dismissed them in Easter week with a letter to the pastor who had sent them to me; in which I begged him, in consideration of my ignorance concerning the true nature of the affair, to make on the spot inquiries into the relations of the family, into the circumstances of the people among whom they had been raised, and in general into everything that might throw light on the matter; also himself, notwithstanding the general prohibition of exorcism, at least to employ the exorcismum probativum.\n\nAt the beginning of June the brothers, to my no small astonishment, returned a second time and brought with them a letter from the pastor, who wrote that he himself had gone to their parental house in Bischofsheim; that he had there examined and investigated all the circumstances, but had discovered nothing significant as to the cause of the matter. He had had the brothers examined by physicians, and these, as the enclosed certificates showed, had detected no bodily disease. Twice he had written to the Vicar General for permission to perform the exorcism; but the latter had only answered evasively. He had now blessed the house, and it had indeed been freed from all haunting; the half-dead cattle were now well too; only the three brothers continued to be tormented, and he therefore repeatedly begged me to apply the exorcism. The medical testimonies ran as follows --- first, that of Dr.\u00a0K\u00fchn: the three brothers had, several years before, suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage and had been treated by him; but the prescribed remedies had been without effect, because the causes of the ailment could not be sufficiently ascertained. \\[Page 88\\]\n\nSecondly, that of the physician Humann in Herrlisheim, who declared that he had examined the brothers stethoscopically, but had found nothing in them that pointed to an organic defect of the sick person, or to a physiological disturbance of the functions of her body as a whole. The brothers, once they reached me, now assured me that when they had left here on their earlier departure they had remained free of all attacks for two days; upon which, however, the evil had returned, and they were again as before in distress. During their previous absence everything at home had been topsy-turvy; there had been terrible noise, and all the cattle in the stable had seemed as if they were about to die. The distraught father had at once run to the Catholic pastor for help; but since he was prevented from assisting personally he had given him blessed palms; and when these were burned in the stable the animals immediately became healthy and rose up well.\n\nThe pastor had afterwards come and blessed the house again, whereupon nothing adverse had occurred since. Only they themselves suffered from the old malady, and begged me piteously to help them, since they firmly believed I could. I had therefore to return to the work, whether I wished to or not, which weighed on me greatly because of the obscurity of the whole affair. I had them tell their stories again, I asked fresh questions, I had them set their answers down in writing; but I could come to no foundation, any more than the first time. Their accounts partly confirmed what had been stated earlier, and partly added new details.\n\nI have again forgotten many things; I will therefore set down only some of what I have written from Jakob before me. He wrote: when he was yet away in foreign parts, a man often came to his workshop by day and by night who showed him how matters stood at home; he always demanded that Jakob should throw money to him, and he would show him what he could do. If Jakob then wished to leave, he could not stir from the spot; nevertheless he was not otherwise prevented from working. The matter soon took a worse turn: the visitors became more numerous; they planned all sorts of things with him, and forced him to swear at night; he often had to carry coffins, was himself laid into them, or had to dig up corpses. They crucified him; but when it was over it appeared that it had been nothing.\n\nNaked women appeared, carried out all manner of mischief with the others, sat on his face, etc., whereupon he then had actual pollutions. They would also have carried him off, it was to him as if he went out through his own eyes, and they led him to games and debauchery. They showed him how they had poisoned the well-water at home, and promised that if he married one of them they would make it right again. Thus it went on as in madness, and when the apparitions presently threatened to devour him, shot at him with pistols, beat him, tore one another's hair, then again came driving up with carriages and horses; another time a man loaded with golden and silver chains would appear and two golden rings would be placed about his arms; when they then rode with him into the clouds, climbed Mount Sinai, gave him nine golden keys, made three garments, set up a white bed before him; meanwhile again firing cannons, making music, launching an assault on Paradise, and desolating and destroying all things --- who could be wise after all that?

This man, then still worldly, had a love affair with a girl whom he had won with the help of a sorceress; in return for this the sorceress had him promise to attend the Sabbath. She contrived it, however, in such a way that he kept his promise. Naked, he anointed himself between the hand and the arm with a certain salve which she had given him, making at the same time a certain sign which she had taught him. The same was done by the teacher and by the girl whom he had already abused. \\[Page 92\\]\n\nAll three were at once lifted up and carried away through an opening in the roof; and he, as it seemed to him, was sitting on a swift horse.

The report is contained in a letter drawn up in the Latin language by a member and superior of a religious order, dated Salzburg, 8 March 1751; and which, for many reasons, the Italian editor to whom it was addressed says deserves the fullest belief. He, however, reports the case in these words:\n\nThe notes concerning the execution of the accused that were requested some months ago could not be given until now, because P. G. N. had not yet received them from the councils and judges. Having returned from Rome, I asked a privy councillor of our prince for inspection of the proceedings; he did not give me the process itself, but only related the species facti \\[the outline of the facts\\], as contained in the enclosed sheet. From this it will be shown, it seems to me, that one in the matter has acted neither too credulously nor too hastily. As to the verdict, matters in Germany are disposed of in few words, which run roughly as follows: \"Since you are convicted and confess to the crime of witchcraft, we condemn you from life to death, that you be executed by the hangman with the sword, and that the body be placed upon the pyre.\" The following narration of the facts reads thus:\n\nIt was the 23rd of January in the year 1749, when in a smith's workshop at M\u00fclldorf, in the Salzburg territory, they perceived how the objects there suddenly moved in an unusual manner; sometimes the tools, tongs, hammers, etc., at other times pigs' feet, pieces of brick, and sometimes also objects that had not before been seen there, flew about and fell down. One man was struck from above by a hammer; another by a flying brick --- however, everything so lightly that whatever fell seemed to have lost its weight and therefore caused no pain. All wondered at this; some were seized by fear, thinking readily that something supernatural was afoot. Only the smith's maid, named Anna Bayerin, who served there as nurse to the child, laughed and said that she feared nothing and that no harm would come of it to her. Clergy were called to bless the house and to free it from the devil's assaults; but there was no remedy until the said maid was ordered to leave. As soon as she was out of the house, it became quiet again. These occurrences, and new disturbances which took place in another house where she passed the night, caused the local magistrate to have the more respectable citizens sworn concerning the facts, and thereafter to order the imprisonment of that maid. I do not wish to defend the interrogations made of her to the hair, or to claim that they were entirely in accordance with law; nor that the confession of the accused always bears the stamp of probability. \\[Page 96\\]\n\nThe following, however, cannot, without prejudice to the truth, be denied. After the interrogation had, at least for the sake of precaution, been begun again from the beginning --- and that without the torture having even once been threatened either at M\u00fclldorf or at Salzburg --- this crafty, and not, as some falsely spread, simple woman, after many evasions at last made the following confession: She said she had been seduced by a seamstress from Neumarkt (a little town between \u00d6ttingen and Landshut), and had devoted herself exclusively to the Devil by the words written in blood: \"I am yours and you are mine!\"\n\nShe further confessed that she had committed a sacrilegious abuse with the Holy Host, which she had often received and immediately taken from her mouth; that she had several times been carried off, by the Devil's help, to nocturnal dances together with her teacher, the aforementioned seamstress, and others; and that she there had received a lump of sugar, which she afterwards threw into a peasant woman's vat. Thereby it came to pass that the cream of the milk --- however much trouble one took in churning --- nevertheless did not make butter for over half a year; until the peasant woman --- who swore to all this on oath --- sold her cow and bought another; whereupon she made butter without difficulty from the milk of the newly purchased animal, while the purchaser of the old cow likewise made butter from that cow's milk. Finally, she declared that, with the Devil's help, she alone was the cause of the disturbances in the smithy.\n\nI am not one of those who take delight only in the new, often to the detriment of the truth; nor have I sworn by the ancients, who are often credulous to the point of superstition. I know that the judges of past centuries, of whom it is told that they frequently condemned the accused to the stake on mere confession, are charged with a hasty and credulous procedure in matters of magic. Nor is it unknown to me that sugar is ascribed the natural power to dissolve cream so that no butter can be made from it. Nor do I mean to deny that the nocturnal dances and journeys from place to place are not always founded in truth; rather, especially among women, they are represented to them in dreams by the help of the imagination, so that when they awake they cannot be dissuaded from them.\n\nHowever, just as I cannot, without exposing myself to presumption for want of reliable information, either approve or still less condemn everything that our predecessors have done; so it is nevertheless known even to those who otherwise know nothing that the public laws, and among them the penal procedure of Charles V, condemn magicians to the fire; and that only a hardened and unwise person could call their existence into question after a many-hundred-year calm observance. That the use of sugar, without the Devil's assistance, may, now and then, hinder the making of butter from milk is comprehensible; but that a small piece should possess such power that it could spoil a vessel for more than half a year --- a vessel which in the meantime had been cleaned several times --- and exercise these powers so long that the cow which had been in possession during the application of the sugar could not be sold, no reasonable person will concede. Whoever believes that those nocturnal dances and flights through the air really took place as often as simple women tell, and that they themselves were present at them, may be considered even more simple than the women themselves. \\[Page 97\\]\n\nOnly when reasonable witnesses, elevated above all doubt --- several of whom were present, awake and by day --- testify from what they saw with their own eyes that they were led away in their presence, and that they with their own hands drove them out of the house; if now against this authority of ocular testimony one man asserts: this never happened; I know that such a one, as one who shamelessly and with"}, "Prophets' School Training and Ecstatic Phenomena in Dauphin\u00e9": {"start_char": 336513, "end_char": 341421, "pages": "99-100", "keywords": ["wrangling and resistance in catechism"], "verbatim": "First he instilled in these a pronounced hatred of the Church, and then he revealed to them: that God had communicated his spirit to him, that he gives it to every one according to his good pleasure; but that he had chosen them in order to transform them into prophets and prophetesses, if they would prepare themselves to receive so great a gift in the manner prescribed by God. The children, in their innocence, were willing, and had now to submit to a strict discipline, in which especially regularly recurring fasts, continued for three days at a stretch, played a principal role; while lectures on the Apocalypse and on the Antichrist in Rome, and his near downfall, directed their minds that way, and familiarized them with the language of the prophets.\n\nUnder this training there gradually appeared in most of the pupils the phenomena of somnambulism; they threw themselves backwards upon the ground, their eyes closed; the region of the pit of the stomach and of the throat swelled, and they remained for a time in this rapt state. When it had come to this point, then the master --- his apprenticeship being, as he said, at an end --- assembled the whole fellowship, placed the person to be proclaimed in the midst of the company, and told him: the time of his inspiration was now come; then he kissed him with a grave and mysterious mien, breathed his breath into his mouth, and announced to him that he was now receiving the spirit of prophecy. The others had witnessed, full of astonishment, the birth of the new prophet, and were moved by the longing soon likewise to attain, in like manner, to the same consecration. After he had thus absolved them all, he sent them out, each to his own place, admonishing them to bestow again upon others the gift of prophecy whom they found fit for it, and who had gone through the same training as themselves. Among the young pupils of the prophetic school two were especially remarkable: a young man of twenty-five years, Gabriel Astier, from the place Clien; and a young shepherdess from the village of Cr\u00eat, called the beautiful Isabelle. While the others remained in concealment, both of them, toward the end of the year 1688, chose respectively a larger scene of action; the one went over into Vivar\u00e8s, the other to Grenoble, at the very time when the Prince of Orange crossed over to England. The Calvinist people were ready to believe the prophets who proclaimed to them the victory of their creed, and thus a great excitement arose in those regions. The vigilance of the authorities, however, prevented an uprising in the Dauphin\u00e9; the prophetess was arrested in Grenoble, and, afterwards being brought to a recognition of her errors, returned to the Church. Astier, in Vivar\u00e8s, having grown more cautious, retired into secrecy, and first consecrated his whole family to the prophetic office, and then others; and when the matter nevertheless became notorious he fled to Bouti\u00e8res, into the wild, inaccessible mountains, and thence began to hold nightly meetings with the inhabitants.\n\nOn the mountain-tops the people gathered, in numbers ranging from a few hundred up to three or four thousand, sometimes at different places simultaneously; on the day appointed by the prophet men, women, and children assembled. The prophet stood among them in a raised place and opened the meeting with the loud cry: Mercy! Mercy! The people answered with the same cry, prostrate on their knees, and the mountains echoed it back. Then a prayer was said, and a psalm sung by all present. Now the presiding officer rose, the assembly did likewise, and after he had cried out, holding his hands over his head, \"Throw yourselves backwards, without danger!\" everyone threw themselves backward; while the prophet, as the number of those falling increased, let his arms sink lower and lower accordingly. The circumstance that sometimes three to four thousand persons thus hurled themselves on their backs without being hurt was regarded as a gift of the prophets. In the midst of the prostrate the prophet himself then fell into the ecstatic state; he was brought back to himself from this state by the candidates for the prophetic office who lay first around him; he then began to prophesy, and went up to the best-prepared among the neophytes, breathed into his mouth, and said: \"Receive the Holy Spirit!\" He at once surrendered his place to the newly consecrated man, who likewise began to prophesy and to communicate the received gift further.\n\nThat the matter did not rest on imagination and artifice, but was rooted in physical states, was shown by the shudders that seized those who fell, the contractions and extensions in arms and legs, the convulsions that made them foam, and the swellings they experienced. They also declared that the spirit communicated itself to them when they had previously taken the fallen upon their laps; and that it usually entered t"}, "C\u00e9vennes War Led by Prophets with Ranks and Deceptions": {"start_char": 342019, "end_char": 343142, "pages": "100", "keywords": ["- war led by prophets 1702"], "verbatim": "\nSparks of the conflagration had meanwhile been blown as far as the C\u00e9vennes, and in the year 1688 there was a first outbreak, which however was soon suppressed.

So it went in the tale of the seduction of Magdalena Bavent, which she set down in her memoirs, and which we will relate in her own words.\n\n\"Born in the year 1607 in Rouen, I lost my parents at about nine years of age; I was brought up by an uncle until my twelfth year, and then remained until my sixteenth in the house of a woman in order to learn to sew. At that time a convent according to the rule of St.\u00a0Francis was established in Louviers, to which saint I had always had a special devotion. I therefore wished to be received there; my relatives interceded for me, and I obtained admission. I entered the convent with the intention, as I can swear on my soul, of serving the Lord there with all sincerity, and began my novitiate in that intention. But we had a terrible man who guided us, the priest David. He read with us the book of a Capuchin about the will of God; but he interpreted this in a most peculiar manner, in which our mistress-novices entirely agreed with him. Under the pretext of obtaining perfect obedience, which must also overcome the most severe and nature-contrary things, he introduced atrocious practices. He said: one must kill sin by sin, in order thereby to return to the innocence of our first parents, who before their fall did not know shame. Those among us were then regarded as the holiest and most virtuous who appeared quite naked in the choir and in the garden, and in that state performed dances. We were accustomed to touch one another; to practice every kind of unnatural sins as paganism had known; to abuse the image of the Crucified and the"}, "Magdalena Bavent Forced into Sacrilegious Communion and Casket Incident": {"start_char": 345770, "end_char": 347515, "pages": "101-102", "keywords": ["magdalena bavent forced into sacrilegious communion and casket incident"], "verbatim": "le.\n\nAt first I resisted these abominations, and was therefore regarded as a disobedient, headstrong, malicious, and refractory person, who was possessed of her own will. When once I was to go to Communion naked down to the belt, I had refused to do so, but I had to yield; when I wished to cover myself at the small grille with the altar-cloth, this was snatched away from me, and when I then used my hands to cover myself, David ordered me to fold them. My conscience kept making constant reproaches to me about all these things; David said these were not sins, and another confessor whom I asked for was not allowed me. I therefore left the convent; but inexperienced as I was, I took the position of a gatekeeper (pf\u00f6rtnerin) of the convent that was offered me; and so I remained, entirely given over to my indiscretion, in that office, albeit outside the convent, yet continuously connected with it.1) I had left at the end of January; at Candlemas David travelled to Paris, then returned at the end of Lent, and died on the Monday of Holy Week. Nothing had occurred between us, except for some licentiousness; but before his journey he had entrusted to me a little casket with the prohibition not to open it. Curiosity, however, drove me to disobey his command; and I found a paper in it, written by him in an unknown hand, but I returned everything to him on his return. I then tended him for a short time during his illness, which appears to have been a syphilitic sore; and on the day of his death he gave this paper to Mathurin Picard, and appointed him his successor in the convent, in his sense and spirit, and in a private interview recommended me to his care.

It is true that I myself did nothing about it --- whether from timidity or a tendency to an unbound life --- which I ought to have done. He pursued me continually, and did not cease from me even in a violent illness, when I was senseless and more dead than alive. Yet because of my resistance he did not succeed in gaining his whole will with me all that time; except once, when he was ill, or only pretended to be ill, and then using force rather than persuasion he wrested my consent from me. What has been said about a similar occurrence in the church is, thank God, unfounded except for one attempt on his part.\n\nThat, however, was not the only thing he intended against me to rob me of my honor; there was another thing I did not suspect because I did not know his devilish arts. While I was ill he had me sign a paper whose contents I did not know. Once at the altar he put a host into my hand, and then, pressing my hand, he broke it so that the pieces fell to the ground. Likewise he wanted me to drink of the wine which he had left in the chalice after the completion of the Mass --- which I, however, never did.

Hardly fifteen days had I been there when he sought a pretext to come into the garden where I was with some nuns. He followed us, and after he had come to a certain spot he produced a host from a book he had with him; with it he picked up some drops of blood that had fallen to the ground, for I was then menstruating. He wrapped them up, called me out into the churchyard, and used my finger to push them into an opening near a shrub. He never spoke to me further about the matter; but I acquired a strong inclination to go repeatedly to that spot, and there I had many filthy temptations and practiced much impurity.

I was terribly frightened by this, and after much resistance I gave only an outward assent, up to, as I believe, the point of damnation. Meanwhile I continued to suffer many pangs of conscience, and I wished to make my confession to the confessor of the sick in the hospital we visited. Picard, who perceived this, hastened to put his design into effect. One day, when he handed me Communion at the grille, he touched my breast through the veil with his finger, and instead of the usual words said: \"You will see what will happen to you because of this.\" I went to my place in the choir, but restlessness drove me into the garden, where I sat down beneath a mulberry tree. There appeared to me a cat which set its hind feet on my knees and its forepaws on my shoulders, and then barred its dreadful jaws over my mouth, as if it would take the Communion from me. Whether that actually happened I do not know; for I sat there for perhaps an hour, unable to make the sign of the cross or to drive the creature away. Picard saw me that same day, and when I asked: was that all the glory I was to receive that day? he answered: \"You will see quite other things yet!\" Two or three days later he said: \"My dear! we have now seen one another; do you not wish that we should see one another again?\" I said yes, to the ruin of my soul. In the night, about eleven, after I had already slept, I heard what sounded like a nun calling me. I rose, and when I reached the door I lost consciousness and felt myself carried to a place where, besides Picard, several clerics and nuns were present. He at once said: \"Beloved, did I not tell you we would see one another again today?\" I answered: \"Yes; but I did not think it would be outside the convent; this assembly is also unknown to me.\" He said: \"You must not trouble yourself about that,\" and so he drew from me a formal assent to everything that was there to happen and that he in particular would do --- the one and only formal assent he extracted from me. Yet my conscience would never be entirely pacified; Picard knew this well, and therefore never quite trusted me, nor did he ever initiate me into his secrets. The day after that event I disclosed everything to the confessor Langlois; whether he was aware of the matter or not, he did not tell me that I had been led to the Sabbath, and left me without counsel. Six months later I told him of my more frequent abductions; which was the easier to do because he had been given the monastery confessional, and Picard, on suspicion, had been removed from it. I had resolved to make a general confession, and had already made three quarters of it, when Picard learned of it and had me called to the confessional grille. He asked why I had stayed so long with the new confessor. I answered: to make a general confession. \"Well,\" he said, touching my hand, \"you have begun, but you will not finish!\" He had spoken truly, for, as he afterwards confessed to me, he had cast a spell between me and the confessor; when I began, it was as if the confessor closed my mouth and drove the sins back. He seemed to be bound in my presence; I, however, as soon as I entered the confessional, was terribly tormented.

Now, since she no longer stood at its head, she used what she received as she pleased, because the donors had left everything to her discretion.\n\nIn the following year she became seriously ill; her conscience awoke, and after hard struggles she now made a confession, by word and in writing, of all the deceptions she had practised. The letter of a nun dated 30 January 1544, in the records, gives an account of what took place on that occasion. The physicians had declared that her condition left no room for hope and that she must prepare herself for death. When her confessor appeared to prepare her to receive the last sacraments, she was seized by a convulsive trembling whose violence put everyone in alarm.

The confessor reported what had occurred to the provincial of the order, who arrived at the convent before Christmas 1513 with several other members of the order. The inquisitors of C\u00f3rdoba, having been informed of the matter, now intervened in the affair and asserted that the investigation belonged to them exclusively. The provincial had meanwhile put himself in readiness to administer the sacraments to her; and arranged that she should sign in her cell a statement in which she confessed several of her deceptions. Magdalena then received the viaticum and thanked God that she had been able to perform this act without an outward and striking incident; although she nevertheless always doubted that God would show her mercy.\n\nThe convent sisters had withdrawn; Magdalena was alone with the one who had recorded all these circumstances in her letter, and who had stayed behind to make the preparations necessary for the Last Anointing. Suddenly the sick woman told her that she felt much better, expressed an extraordinary desire to take food, and urgently begged her to bring something to satisfy her hunger. When the sister now brought her some nourishment, she seemed to return to life with joy. When the confessor visited her, she wished to continue her confession orally; the confessor prepared to set it down in writing in the presence of Father Peter of Vergara. But Magdalena opened her mouth only to retract everything she had previously declared; whereupon the two priests left her displeased. The nuns then urged her, for the sake of her own peace, to make a sincere confession, and she at last promised them. The confessor then acted as if he were dismissing everyone; but they positioned themselves so that they could hear everything without being seen by the patient. Magdalena then made various declarations, the confessor wrote them down, and obtained from her the promise to sign the written statement in the presence of the convent sisters. They appeared at once; but as they drew near, trembling and convulsions returned to her.

In the year 1584, when she counted twenty-five years, and Louis of Berlaimont was Archbishop and Duke of Cambrai, it was perceived and noted in her that she was possessed and taken by evil spirits; and the archbishop decreed that the ecclesiastical remedies should be applied to her. The struggle lasted nearly two years; at last she was entirely freed after hard resistance, and shortly before, in obedience to a vision, she wrote her self-confessions, which we here communicate in extract.\n\nI know that by my father's curse I was delivered to the Devil. In my fourth year he appeared to me in the form of a handsome young man, desired to be my father; and because he brought me an apple and white bread, I consented to his request and took him for my real father. As long as I was still a child, I had beside him another who took care that I would not feel the blows when I was punished. That continued until my twelfth year, when, weary of the convent in which they had me educated, I returned to my mother. From there I was soon again bound out to a seamstress in Bergen, so that I should learn to sew there, where I then had almost my free will. Now my alleged father came to me, saying: because I had taken him as father, I must necessarily live by his will. Hitherto I had lived like a child; now, however, it was fitting that I live as he would show me; and like all people lived, even if they did not say so. If I did not do it, he would inflict upon me the pain which he showed me; if I consented to what he required of me, I should have silver and gold whenever I wished, and of food and drink whatever my heart desired.\n\nAt first I refused, then I yielded to him, and granted everything he wanted. Now a great throng of them appeared before me, whereat I was somewhat terrified, because I had never seen more than two or three of them together. They then made me take paper and pen and write down that I renounced baptism, Christianity, and all the ceremonies of the Christian Church. After I signed the document with my blood, they made me swallow it in a bitter orange. It seemed very sweet to me up to the last bite; that last bite, however, was so bitter that I could not endure it. From that time on I have been everywhere hostile to the Church, had a great dread of it, always sought to flee and avoid it, and to hide myself from it; otherwise, however, I have always lived in every wickedness and all sins.\n\nWhen I had grown somewhat older and they began to speak to me of receiving the holy Sacrament, it was most abhorrent to them; and they tormented me almost until I promised them that, if I got hold of that, I would act according to their counsel and will. First I had to give and present my tongue to one of them, so that in confession before the priest I would say nothing more than what they deemed good. When I was to go to the Lord's table, they had made the holy Host altogether loathsome to me, and had made me abhor it; yet I was to comport myself with a false heart and flattery about it, as the others among whom I lived did. \\[Page 117\\]\n\nEven during and throughout Mass I ate much sugar and confectionery, to the shame of the most venerable Sacrament. When I then received the Host at the altar, I immediately stepped to one side; and because, as long as I had it in my mouth, I was sorely tormented in my throat, I took it straight out and wrapped it in my neckerchief. At home I laid it in a little white linen cloth; though they wished that I should cast it into some unclean place. Afterwards, however, it was by a higher power taken away from my person. I could not comprehend why people of such wicked sort showed so much reverence and adored it: and no one could give me any satisfactory account of it. My questioning angered the evil spirits; they blasphemed the holy Host to the utmost, and I had to draw up a document for them in which I renounced that loose, vain Communion, together with the false god on the cross. I also cursed the sacrifice of the Mass, and vowed that whenever I saw the Host lifted up I would, with my eyes fixed upon it, spit in Christ's face, and blaspheme and revile him. In return I bound myself to worship their gods henceforth, and to observe all their ceremonies.\n\nThey put the writing, written with my blood, into my body; a third writing, to abide with them forever, they kept in their custody outside my body. Thus I was wholly and entirely separated from the Catholic Church, as if I had never been in it. Since it did not at all times suit that I should be able to remove the Host from my mouth at Communion, I agreed with them that they should all depart from me on that same day. For they could not endure the burden of the holy Host; it pressed upon them too strongly, and they held me on that very day to be unclean and unfit; but on the following day they tormented me all the harder for it. Whenever I wished to go to church, they made my limbs so heavy, as if I were dragging masses of iron behind me.\n\nWhen I entered the order, I once more set up for them a new writing: in which I granted them full power over body and soul; I bestowed upon them both of my free possessions forever, and entrusted them wholly to their protection and shelter. Thus they had almost swallowed me up, and wholly transformed me into themselves; and I could do no good work any more, lived quite brutishly without any knowledge of God; yet they let me go on carelessly and without seriousness in performing what the order required. On the night before I took the customary monastic vows, they made me write a protestation: that my vow should be only a sham; instead of yielding my obedience to God and to my superiors, I gave it into their hands, to deal with it for their favor. I am, they said, not a nun at all, and would never be one in eternity; as proof of this I delivered to them the profession which I had made. Thus the longer I was with them, the more perverse I became. If sometimes good thoughts came to me, they tormented me with many godless things, and I had now to put my heart in writing to them as well; so that they might lay the writing upon what had been written, and govern it thereby according to their pleasure.\n\nNow a cursed spirit came to me, who at first threatened me most severely, and demanded of me that I should grant him alone as much power over body and soul as all the others together had. He also brought three others with him, whom I was to permit to enter and depart my body at their pleasure; in return he promised to furnish me so richly with art and skill that I might confute everyone who came against me. I was rashly curious, and would gladly have learned the art which he almost loudly extolled to me. \\[Page 118\\]\n\nI was also persuaded, and gave to the first of the three my memory, to the second my understanding, to the third my will; and they each carried them into me and placed them in their particular seat. Thus all my senses were bound, and I was transformed from a person into a devil. The loose knave then brought me another one, who was called the Enchanter; he had the shape of a R\u00fcbezahl, almost fair and pleasant to look upon. When I held this in my hands I saw and knew whatever I could desire. By means of it I also had knowledge of all evil and unjust doctrines and religions in every place and corner; I also saw and knew all their ceremonies and the falsely supposed worship of God that is practiced everywhere; of that one could write an unspeakable amount. To this I was moreover obliged: that, if every earlier obligation should become powerless, the one, strangely written in foreign and unknown characters, and as comprehensive as the others, should remain hidden and valid. After him followed another, called Freilehre; he gathered blasphemers, heathens and Saracens about him. He asked me why I still carried a piece of the Cross on me. I had to tear it from me with terrible railing and cursing; they made me trample it with my feet, and I had to renounce the crucified God who allowed himself to be hanged on it, and his blood, all the articles of the faith and the holy sacraments.\n\nThey set before me now meals of all sorts of foods, and I held myself the happiest person on earth; in this they greatly strengthened me, and I was entirely willing and ready. After some time they accused me that I had never asked any favor of them; I should desire to receive baptism in their fashion and manner, which I then did, so that I would become wholly and entirely their own. They then took off my garment, anointed all my limbs with a precious oil, as it seemed to me, together with other great pomp; then clothed me again in quite different garments, and I chanted with them their loose, doggish Mass and cursed devilish words. Since they also said they had no power to fasten me entirely in their service until I renounced all the graces I had received from the Church, I had to deny the sacrament of Confirmation. I was now also to receive Communion, in their fashion and manner, from their hands every month, and beforehand abstain for three days from every other food, except that which they gave me. They then took a morsel which had a very pleasant and sweet taste; with that they played much mockery and pomp. They did this upon a high elevated place, pronounced a blessing over it according to their opinion; then they gave it into my mouth, and that they called their Communion.\n\nAgainst the Christian Communion they spoke blasphemous, scornful words; I had to throw the holy Host to the ground, and they spat upon it; yet I am quite certain I remember that I could never bring myself actually to hit it. They also let me take a piece of the holy Cross; I set it upon the top of a credenza, fastened the holy Host to it, and then said: if he were the right, true God, he must show it, and would not allow himself to be so miserably dressed and tormented! And I know well that I did all this with particular rage, scorn and hatred. I, wretch, held this pious God worse than the thieves who were crucified with him; for I could not once get into my head that a God should thus allow himself to be nailed to a cross. Therefore when I once saw a procession with the holy Sacrament pass by my room, and then saw the people with their many lights and great devotion and reverence, I wondered greatly how it came about that so many people would strive to accompany such a thing, which to me was so utterly repugnant, indeed an abomination. \\[Page 119\\]\n\nAnd I began almost to laugh and to deride: Behold a wonder! how is it that the one whom the Christians worship is carried about by men; and moreover so mockingly and always in the shape of a naked man. Meanwhile they set up before me, by the one who called himself a sorcerer, all manner of panels and images, and they placed these their idols aloft with great reverence and diabolical singing; which, at that time, sounded very pleasing in my ears, and then I offered no canonical hour or prayer except what they put into my mouth.\n\nWhen these their idols thus stood forth in their glory, they made me step up to the first tier; thereupon they raised a great clamor and shouting; and I pledged them my fidelity, and never to worship any other god than those to which they should point me. After such an oath they embraced me with great joy, praised and exalted me to the highest --- thinking they had never bound any creature so firmly to themselves as they had bound me. They also often gave me great feasts, and told me with what unspeakable joy they would lead me from this life into that life.\n\nThey were exceedingly angry at the images of the saints; and I had to suffer severely if I uttered my customary prayer, which they had taught me, in their presence. They otherwise held very rigidly and strictly to their statutes; I also had to confess my transgressions to one of them; thereupon I was punished without any mercy; and one after another came and inflicted some torment upon me. When a commanded fast-day occurred, they brought me meat and forced me to eat it; even unclean animals they thrust into my body when I acted against their command. All high feast-days, the Christians' times of joy, were fast-days for me; I had also to perform all sorts of practices contrary to Christian rites. If I had not observed one, then they made me so hungry that I became as if furious and raging about it, and yet everything I tried to enjoy I had to give up again, until they were satisfied with their sport.\n\nIn such heavy servitude I led my life; one after another who called himself a god I had to obey for a day or a week at a time. Yet one always remained with me who brought me every sort of delight, joy and diversion; and that pleased me well, and I was of good cheer. Another, who called himself the spirit of true freedom, likewise kept close to me; and for several years they contrived so that they would gladly have brought me out of the cloister, but they were not able to do so.\n\nNow one came to me who gave me an image, wondrously prepared, and said: if this is to be the true god, to whom you shall sacrifice and serve, he shall be called Ninus. Such a proposal pleased me exceedingly, for he recounted to me in splendid words his power and authority in the world. Upon my assent he bade the others prepare the place for it. A whole host of them appeared, to whom I devoted my body, so that they might do with it altogether according to their desire and will. The wretched sorcerer-devil, whose services I had employed in this, now presented to me a palace by his specter. But to me it was nothing else but as if it were a glorious, wondrously beautiful temple; and in my eyes it seemed that no church could be compared to such temples. \\[Page 120\\]\n\nIn these temples I worshipped the idol which I myself had made by diabolical craft and instruction, and which thereafter was burned by the priests in the fire. Now one came to me who called himself the spirit of blood, saying: so that you might be altogether perfect and without blemish, you must not offer a dead but a living sacrifice from your own body. At this proposal I was appalled; I had never before seen this god of blood, as he called himself, and I rejected his demand.\n\nThen he threatened me strongly: he would make me a shame before the whole world; and the cursed villains tormented me so miserably that I had to obey their will at any time. Then a devil came with a great retinue who called himself Beleal, and to whom I was to sacrifice the victim. They set him with great reverence upon a splendid throne and waited on him for service. The blood-devil placed me before him and demanded of me that I, of my good, free will, give him power and authority to enter into my body, and from the same freely and unhindered take out the victim. From three parts of my body a piece was to be cut from each, which could not be done without gruesome pains, but great grace and rich reward would follow; for this work would have greater force and effect than anything I had ever done. I would then become like God, and they would afterwards cause me to be worshipped in God's stead. To such high promises I yielded to their will.\n\nThey now laid me upon a table, upon which I first had to spread a white linen cloth in order to catch the blood; and now, with my miserable pains, a piece was cut out which I wrapped in the blood and brought as an offering to Beleal. The same game was played with me for the next two days. Ah, what a painful sacrifice that was --- pain upon pain! --- and I also had to put on an outward show before the people as"}, "Miraculous Bleeding of the Host and Failed Suicide Attempts by Johanna Fery": {"start_char": 403159, "end_char": 408788, "pages": "120-122", "keywords": ["miraculous bleeding of the host and failed suicide attempts by johanna fery"], "verbatim": "dened with some other bodily infirmity!\n\nMeanwhile many pious and Christian people often spoke to me worthily about the most holy Sacrament; I thought to myself: if I might see a sign of it, I would straightway worship it beside my other gods as well. That displeased the devils, and they punished me bitterly for it. They bade me take a host, of which I always had a supply; and I took it up to a place in the house. \"Now we will, make and command thee,\" they said, \"that thou now, in our presence, curse and deny it, and with drawn knife, out of spite and mockery, stab it through; then thou wilt see what little power it has, and how weaker it is than we.\" Then, with a hardened heart, I drew my knife and thrust it into the most worthy Sacrament. After that stab the blood immediately began to gush from it, and the chamber was filled with a bright radiance which surrounded the holy host; which then again was transported back to its place where the others were. Then I was very frightened, especially since all the bystanders at once fled away with frightful howling, tumult and trembling, and left me half dead behind. I then began to weep and to consider that I had truly been deceived and seduced by the devils; and when I reflected properly on the sign I at last fell quite into despair. \\[Page 121\\]\n\nThen the devils came raging to me, saying: they had indeed hitherto certainly deceived and seduced me; I had pierced the true God, whom they themselves acknowledged thereby; the sin which I had committed could not be forgiven; nothing remained for me but to do as Judas did and hang myself. Since they now also threatened to take my life, I consented to be hanged by them. They bade me go up upon the roof of the house and put my leather belt about my own neck. I did so, and gave them full power to deal with me according to their pleasure. There were a great number of them who disputed over my soul; they hoisted me up to strangle me. But however they attempted it, it was impossible for them to draw the belt tight about my throat. They ascribed this to the protection of a sodomitical wretch --- the so\u2011called St.\u00a0Mary Magdalene --- who defended me; and said I ought to yield myself to the loose harlot.\n\nI said it in plain words, for it seemed to me I was already half dead. But however cruelly they tormented me, and thrust into my belly, they nevertheless never were able to kill me. The murder-devil then said to me: I should thrust the knife into my throat; thereby I would inflict on myself the due punishment. But it was not possible for me to accomplish such a thing; for I could not bring my arm to my neck, however firmly a whole swarm helped me thereto. The girdle I had to give them, and they afterwards always kept it with them.\n\nI then returned downstairs, tired, weak, shattered, and half broken; was exceedingly sad, and ceaselessly what I had seen lay upon my mind; and I had to lie down to recover. They sent for the physician, and gave me medicines; but by bodily means I could not be helped. From that time forward it lay constantly on my mind that I would gladly have sought the opportunity to learn the truth concerning the venerable Sacrament. But because I was not myself, and could not use any of my limbs according to my will, they hindered me whenever I came before a priest; and caused that I straightway spoke the opposite, and set forth all manner of subtle, captious things.\n\nFrom that time on, whenever I went to the holy Sacrament, a trembling and a shudder assailed me: and it was finally perceived that I did not lead the life that a believing Christian and a person of the Order ought to live. Then counsel was taken in the convent to keep me confined in a separate room, and to consider counsel and means to reconcile me again with God. Yet at that time they could have no knowledge of all that had befallen me; and I led the most miserable life, desiring only to drown myself or to kill myself, if I could have found the opportunity. The nuns of the convent who saw me in that evil state had pity on me, comforted me, and spoke kindly to me. My words in return were so exceedingly awkward, rough and unfriendly, that they appeared unpleasant to them; therefore they had to leave me in my condition. \\[Page 122\\]\n\nMy lord, the Archbishop, came to our convent, and I wished to take refuge with him; but they so blinded my face that he appeared to me very stern and terrifying. They also once showed me the abyss of Hell, together with the punishment that I would have to suffer for each of my sins; I saw in a deep pit nothing but fire, darkness, intolerable stench, hellish dragons and serpents, one of which I must swallow, because I had received Communion on Holy Maundy Thursday. They have done all this to me out of their great malice, and all this is not fancy or imagination, but truly happened thus; for I know and confess that I committed the sins written above with my own body and my limbs, as I have told.\n\nBut the power and mercy of God, who never abandons his creatures in their distress, did not regard that I had gone far from him; rather he caused me to seek and run after help, and sent me Saint Mary Magdalene, who did not forsake me in all my greatest anguishes. To her praise and honor I have related what sort of life I led at the instigation of the devil; so that it may be made known to all the world what grace and help I obtained from this my intercessor and protector.

In her delusion she had at first made a prostration before the archbishop and begged his blessing. There her patron saint had appeared to her in great splendor, and to her terror, and to the consternation of her spirits, had received the blessing in her name. They then pronounced the exorcism over her, and compelled one of these spirits of hers to speak; and he confessed in all their names that they would be forced to depart by the merit of these saints.\n\nWhen it was soon noticed that the patient was utterly and entirely without faith, priests were appointed to her by the archbishop to instruct her in the knowledge of God. She, however, showed herself stubborn and contentious and disputed every point; and the archbishop had to have her sign the Creed with her own hand in order to move her to grant him some belief. She was then instructed in her conventual duties; the original of her profession document, which had been lost, had to be procured again, and she was required to make her profession a second time.\n\nThey led her then through all the churches and to all the relics of the diocese, and bathed her in holy water, through whose power and effect all manner of base and abominable things then issued from her: tufts of hair and many little creatures, like smoky worms, came from her --- all of which caused a very great stench. To curb her malice and to weary the enemies, she was put into a dark and narrow prison. But as the evil only grew, she was brought back into the sick-room, and Sister Barbara Deruillers was assigned to her as keeper. There the evil spirits tormented her severely again, so that she often screamed for three hours at a stretch. In the presence of her keeper she was hurled from the bed into the room, and with head, arm, or the whole body so fiercely thrown against the floor that one saw the marks everywhere. \\[Page 123\\]\n\nShe could often eat nothing for three days, and then they filled her mouth with poisonous vermin. Once she was dragged to the brook that runs just behind the convent and thrust under the water. The keeper cried for help, and they could not drown her; the fellow sisters pulled her out alive. Another time she was cast from her chamber out of the window onto the courtyard; again she was led to the highest rooms of the house in order to hurl her down from there as well. To guard against this, they resolved to bind her with strong straps and ropes to a stout wooden chair and to lay her arms crosswise in a stock; but all in vain. She slipped her body, arm and leg nimbly out of the bonds without any knot having been loosened or any wood having been displaced from its place; and then at midnight she was led to a part of the convent that is very narrow and to which few people ever come, where, after long searching, she was finally found.\n\nThen for a time she was made foolish so that she knew no one, and constantly said: \"I will die, I!\" and therefore would neither eat nor drink. Then she fell utterly silent and wept without cessation; at last she could neither sit nor lie down, but went like a madwoman pacing up and down the chamber. When a fast-day came, she could not take any food on the previous day; then on the day itself such a dreadful hunger came upon her that she would have eaten her own flesh. Thereupon, again in the presence of the priests, raw carrion was brought to her; and they filled her mouth with fetid blood and rotten flesh so that no one could endure being near her.\n\nNow, following an apparition of her patron saint, a kind of wall was built around her in her chamber; which prevented the spirits from coming to her past the middle of the room. Soon, in confession, they learned from her the pledges she had made to them, and these were wrung from her by the exorcism. Fourteen consecrated hosts, which she had gradually put aside, were returned; and among them was one with a bloody mark where the stab had gone through. A piece of the cross also had to be fetched again.\n\nShe finally relapsed once more, and pledged anew to her spirits that she would never abandon them; but soon after, by a new apparition of her patron saint, she was again brought back to the right way. Now the images of silver and of bell\u2011metal to which she had sacrificed were surrendered. When they immediately learned also what had been done with the cutting out of a piece of flesh from her body, the spirits were compelled to speak about it. At first they denied it, then said that the injury of the wounded would be mortal if they left her. But when the exorcism continued, the three pieces, wrapped in the cloth, were placed at the spot assigned to them. She was then tormented the whole night with unheard\u2011of pains, until at last in the morning they left her. \\[Page 124\\]\n\nShe remained free for three weeks or longer, during which, in the last nights, much blood and putrid flesh came from her. An almost strange condition in several places of her body then continued for another year and 23 weeks, with much pain. Her evil spirits were now by the exorcism gradually entirely separated from her. Only one, who had been the first and had then taken the father's place with her, would absolutely not depart. He told her that whatever she had hitherto said and done had all happened through him; if he therefore left her, she would come to notable shame, because she, who had all along been counted a reasonable, sharp\u2011witted person, would then no longer be able to speak a single word of her own.\n\nThis moved her heart and distressed her so much that she threw herself at the feet of her exorcist, begging him to let her at least keep that one. When he refused, she cried amid many tears: \"O what a bitter parting that is!\" Only when he promised her that he would be her father in the place of the one expelled---whom she afterward additionally set beside the archbishop as grandfather---did she permit that he too be expelled.\n\nNow the liberated woman had become truly natural, purely innocent, childlike in simplicity; she had become entirely ignorant, without any knowledge of God or of creatures; she could not utter any other words than: \"Pater! Haus! and beautiful Maria!\" With the image of the latter that was handed to her she played like a child with its doll, and spoke to it. They therefore had to take her again like a child into instruction, and first teach her to make the sign of the cross. By the archbishop's blessing her tongue had to be unloosed again to restore to her the use of speech. The same had to be done to all her limbs so that she might be able to walk properly again.\n\nA whole year was still appointed to her as a year of penance, during which she, being exposed to outward attacks of her spirits, had to suffer severe torment. Meanwhile she was taught again to read and to pray. At a comforting apparition of her patron saint, on the anniversary of the former one, her mind became keener; and she then received instruction, in part from the archbishop himself, in the catechism of Father Canisius, not without much wrangling and resistance on her part. For occasional relapses still occurred from time to time; in one of these she rushed so furiously with fists and feet at the archbishop that he had scarcely enough to do to save his life from her.\n\nWhen she came in the catechism to the doctrine of the Eucharist, she absolutely would not give credence to the truth of it; and it required a private vision to remove all her doubts. For four months she was then taught the choir-singing, which she mastered completely. Meanwhile her bodily injuries, arising from the suffering, had in silence again become so serious that they were obliged to summon the physician Cospeau and some women knowledgeable in female conditions to see whether they could not procure her some relief. The counsel which these, together with the physician, held amounted to this: the injury is mortal; the prescribed medicines, however, only caused her further torments; and it came to pass that within a few hours her death was expected. But after first many pieces of rotting flesh had come away, she was restored to her former state. After several times more demoniac ecstasies alternated with others of a higher kind, at last the crisis drew near. \\[Page 125\\]\n\nShe gathered all the clergy about her who had hitherto stood by her; they likewise summoned her convent-sisters so that all might be present with their prayers; and in the afternoon, at three o'clock, the struggle began in the presence of her patron saints. She faltered and trembled, and behaved as one in the last agonies; she spoke from time to time with her tormentors and answered their words. At times she cried out: They tear me apart, they tear me apart! Then she was again plunged into the utmost fear and pain. Thereupon she suddenly cried: Ah, how will it fare with me yet, I can no longer endure it!\n\nThey comforted her and strengthened her with prayers. Finally there came a tugging at the ceiling and a delirium like that of a dying person. When she was asked what she was beginning, she answered: She herself then lay down upon her pillow and lay there as in wide stillness, and the struggle was decided. The parts of her body which had been cut away and thereby separated and set apart were again joined together in their natural places, and all her pains ceased. Those present sang \"Herr Gott, dich loben wir\" (Lord God, we praise thee)! She displayed many wounds which she had received in the struggle, and showed the shirt that was full of blood; then prayed her hours and went with the sisters into the refectory to supper.\n\nOn 6 January 1586 she had yet one last convulsion, in which Mary Magdalene appeared to her, and she was wholly and forever freed. The course of events was then written down; that and the sister's writing were read before the apostolic and royal notary Godfried von Liere; in the presence of the archbishop, Dr.\u00a0Fr.\u00a0Buisseret, the official, the canon Goubille, Dean Hollo, Mansent, the canon of St.\u00a0Germain, Banay, canon of Andemie, the confessor of the convent, the sister Deruillers, former attendant of Johanna, the present abbess, the liberated woman herself, the physician Cospeau, one of the midwives, and finally some of the old convent-women; all of whom, so far as concerned them, confirmed the truth of what had been read as eyewitnesses; whereupon the summoned notary"}, "Necato of Urrugne and Witnesses Attend Sabbaths While Imprisoned Without Ointment": {"start_char": 438211, "end_char": 441873, "pages": "132-133", "keywords": ["necato of urrugne and witnesses attend sabbaths while imprisoned without ointment"], "verbatim": "ients themselves.\n\nDe Lancre says on this point: in Labourd one has consistently been of the belief that the ointment is prepared with the fat of children murdered before receiving baptism; and it has therefore been customary that novices in the witchcraft are allowed to have the prepared ointment shared with them by others; but that the further advanced must prepare it themselves, in order thereby to drive them to child\u2011murder. With still further advancement of the initiated, the ointment then finally became altogether needless.\n\nThe fiend Necato of Urrugne, the same reporter relates, as a prisoner went every night to the Sabbath; and I can assure you that she had neither grease nor ointment, nor the possibility of procuring any. For she sat confined alone in the chamber of an honest house; with her were 20--25 witnesses, who almost all likewise went to the Sabbath and slept in two other rooms of the same house. Three witnesses testified that they had been with her on the Sabbath at Lacua, on the coast of Hendaye, on the penultimate and the last July, 1600. They were answered that they were prisoners, and that therefore their statement must necessarily be an error; for they themselves had been in confinement on those nights and had had no ointment. We therefore confronted the witnesses and the accused with one another.\n\nA girl called Gastagnalde testified against Necato that Necato ordinarily brought her to the Sabbath herself, and that on that night she too had been carried through the air to that place, where Necato stood by her as godmother and struck her very hard. The accused at length admitted the charge as founded; the complainant had received the blows because she herself had struck a toad that had been handed to her to keep. Cristoval of Garalde, aged 15--16 years, added that, as a reward for having revealed everything the day before, he had, although like the other witnesses previously confined, been led by the fiend Marissans of Tartas to the Sabbath. She had swung him so high into the air that he did not recognize the place of the Sabbath. There he was cruelly mistreated, and he had also seen Necato strike that Gastagnalde; to which he added certain particulars. \\[Page 133\\]\n\nThe third, Aspileuetta, added that she, together with the previous witness, had been brought there by one who formerly used to lead her to the Sabbath, and had witnessed the same; which Necato in fact confessed anew upon repeated accusation. She further asserted that she had been brought one night toward Hendaye, where a small Sabbath was held. There also appeared Detsail, whom the judges already knew from other statements, that he there habitually carried the basin into which every attendee placed his offering or his penance; and he too sat then, in accordance with one of their dispositions, likewise in prison.\n\nThe Necato had accused him, and he therefore struck her hard in the assembly. At that time Monsieur Laurent de Moisset, advocate at the Parliament of Bordeaux, who sat with the rest of us in Bayonne to try these women, happened to be in Hendaye. There two women came to him who reported: Detsail, although in prison, had been at the assembly on the previous night, and there had struck the Necato with the utmost severity. Two girls from Hendaye, not far off, living near the place where the Sabbath had been held, had recognized her by her voice. They wished to be doubly sure of the matter, and had the Necato brought forward. She repeated the confession she had previously made. They also had Detsail brought forward, and she stood by her statement before him; at the same time averring that she had always see"}, "Maria Dindart of Sare on Attending Sabbath Only After Sleep": {"start_char": 442356, "end_char": 443595, "pages": "133-134", "keywords": ["- to attend sabbath for sorcery"], "verbatim": "\nWhatever therefore underlay it, it could not have been mere frenzy or malice; there must have been a condition present in all these people in which they all stood in an inward rapport; from which they then drew the truth and the concurrence that appeared in their statements.

Franziska Haquart, who stood before the court in the year 1587, had, when her daughter Fana was only seven years old, given her over to the unclean spirit, so that he would thereafter leave her untroubled. She immediately reported this to the judge, and the daughter's testimony agreed with the mother's statement. On account of her youth she was released, while the mother had to atone with fire. A respectable matron thereupon took the child in hand and urged her to the fear of God, to bring her back from the godless condition. It succeeded so well that at last people entirely came to believe that it had been altogether accomplished. \\[Page 150\\]\n\nThen it happened that, one night when she lay in bed between two maids, she was suddenly borne aloft, as if the spirit would take her with it. How likely --- it would indeed have actually happened --- had not the maids prevented it by their cry: \"Lord Jesus, help!\" When the spirit thus saw his work disturbed, he left his prey hanging up among the beams, and departed. The maids did not invent this; the whole neighborhood attested to what had occurred. For at the cry for help from the maids everyone hastened in and had seen how everything was arranged. The stiffness in which the little maid was found, her pitiable condition, and the fact that for eight whole days she took no food, remaining continually awake and silent, proved that no deceit had crept in. The very rigidity in which the child was found testifies that her condition had been nervous; that in the seizure she had spasmed locally, and was then borne aloft as far as the space permitted.

He wished to satisfy himself by personal inspection as to the cause of the circumstances there occurring, and therefore promised clemency to an old witch, from among the others, if she would perform her sorcery in his presence. The old woman accepted the proposal and asked for her ointment-box, which had been taken from her; and then she, in the company of the commissioner and many other persons, climbed up a tower. There she placed herself at a window and, with the ointment, rubbed her flat hand, her loins, the joints of the elbow, the underside of the arm, the shoulder and the left side. Then she called with a loud voice: \"Art thou present?\" Everyone present then heard a voice in the air say: \"Yes, here I am!\" The witch then began to descend the tower, head downwards, using her hands and feet in the fashion of lizards. When she had thus reached about the middle of the height, she took flight into the air; and the eyes of those present followed her until the horizon hid the flyer. All remained full of astonishment at what they had seen, and the commissioner caused it to be announced that a considerable sum of money would be given to whoever should bring the escaped woman back. After two days the shepherds brought in the one found. The commissioner asked her why she had not flown farther away in order to escape the inquiries of those searching for her.

It takes him three years before he comes back to his native place. The generality and indefiniteness with which these narratives are framed proves that they rest upon popular legend. This legendary character appears still more plainly in what William of Newburgh relates of an incident that happened, when he was still a boy, in the province of Deir, not far from his birthplace. \\[Page 155\\]\n\nFrom a place near the eastern sea, where the river Vispe is situated, a peasant had gone to visit his friend in the neighbouring village and returned late at night in a not entirely sober frame of mind. From the nearest hill, not far from the road --- the one I have often seen --- he heard the voice of a merry company. He wondered who could make such a noise so late at night; and when he saw a door in the side of the hill, he went in to look. He found there a large, brightly lit chamber, and many men and women sitting as at a feast. One of the serving attendants, when he saw him standing in the doorway, brought him a cup, which he took; but, because he hesitated to drink, he poured out its contents; then he tucked the cup away and withdrew. Thereupon there arose an uproar inside on account of the cup; the guests pursued him, but he escaped them thanks to the excellence of his horse, and reached his home safely. The cup, of unknown material, unusual colour and peculiar shape, came to the elder Henry, King of England; then to David, the brother of the Queen, and long preserved in the Scottish treasury. A few years ago, as the legend says, it was handed over to King Henry II, who wished to see it, by the Scottish William. The hill in this tale is the old Benusberg, into which the Wild Host rides every year; the cup, however, is the Oldenburg drinking-horn which Count Otto won in the hunt from the maiden who, emerging from the Osen- or Asen-mountain, offered it to him filled with a draught which he poured out; the horn, spurring his horse, he carri"}, "Claudius Chotey Witnesses Masked Women at Revel Near Wisembach": {"start_char": 517140, "end_char": 518656, "pages": "155-156", "keywords": ["claudius chotey witnesses masked women at revel near wisembach"], "verbatim": "\nBut this legend takes another turn again in an inquiry conducted by Remy, where it appears as if it were a historical happening. In L\u00fctzen, at the foot of the Vosges, in May of the year 1580, the neighbours celebrated a kind of carnival; and Claudius Chotey had returned at night to the place Wisembach. He had already half climbed the mountain that lay between the two places; then, in an otherwise clear, calmer air, he was seized by a vortex and now looked about him, astonished at what might be happening around him. There, at a place apart on the edge of the cliff, he saw six masked women dancing around a table set with many silver and gold vessels, flinging their heads about like the possessed; with them, on a black ox, sat a man who watched their revels. When he stood there, to look at the matter more closely, all was lost to his eyes. He went forward, and when he had already come over the crest of the mountain, he saw those women following him, still silently swaying their heads. Before them was the one with the dark face who made at him a clawing look; but he defended himself against her with his sword, so that the assailant fled. The women in the meantime returned with their leader a third time, and Chotey, now bolder, went nearer and recognised Desiderius Garete, to whom he then gave his word that he would keep secret what he had seen.

This is also confirmed by the third form of the tale, as told by Joachim K\u00e4mmerer of Bamberg. A butcher was walking through a little wood at night; there he hears a noise and a dancing, goes up to it --- and the dancers vanish. He now sees silver goblets standing there, takes them, and brings them to the authorities. They thereupon arrest, as witches, those whose marks were upon the goblets, together with others who had been denounced, and execute them all together. That they, says Lerchheimer of Steinfelden (who tells the story), were witches is to be inferred from the fact that they had accused others whom the devil, in a dream --- as if they had been together there --- had shown to them. They had lain at home and slept; meanwhile the devil kept watch, and "}, "Spirit Abducts Child Conrad Eysenkopf": {"start_char": 521685, "end_char": 523467, "pages": "157-158", "keywords": ["- spirit temptations in children"], "verbatim": "t without the smallest doubt. What Binsfeld, an upright and very reliable man, relates from the Trier records may well demonstrate the possibility of such real abductions; but it does not suffice to establish the reality of such assemblies. He adduces, first, a noteworthy example of an invisible child-abduction to prove the power of imperceptible forces in the matter. The wife of Johann Eysenkopf, a burgher of Wilmar, called Margaretha, had borne a little boy named Conrad. A spirit often stole him from the cradle, before and after her laying-out \\[i.e.\u00a0the funeral-like rite?\\] --- from the feast of the Resurrection to that of the Departure of the Apostles --- and carried him to other places. Once he laid him in the mother's bed, another time he hid him beneath the steps of the cellar-stair; at times he carried him to the loft or to the privy. But so that no harm should befall the child in these happenings, he always placed cloths under him which he had likewise secretly stolen from the parents.\n\nOnce, when the mother destroyed such a bed as the spirit had prepared in the bathing-room, her face and hands swelled up, as far as they were not covered by her clothes, and her skin peeled off. At times the spirit would also rock the little boy, and he always cried when his mother had put him into the cradle, but was perfectly calm when the spirit had carried him to another place. The dean of the place, W. Lyndner, wrote to Binsfeld for remedy, and the latter advised the use of sacramentals. They were applied, and the older people also undertook a pilgrimage, whereupon the matter subsided for a time. But soon the consecrated objects were found torn away, and the invisible one began his game again.

But although they appeared fiery, they by no means had the power to burn. For though they flew around him in a circle, and, sweeping past him at the swiftest speed, often struck his face, they did indeed press upon him in every way, but never harmed him with fire.

After she has spoken, namely, of the images of the gods, which in animal form as dragon, serpent; or in human form, after the manner of the ancient pagans, are formed, baptized, and worshiped on the Sabbath; she also speaks of the sacraments of the synagogue, of which she knows only four: baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, and marriage, since confession is practiced only in mockery of the Christians. Not all priests are admitted to the sacrifice; only twelve out of all are chosen, to perform it in the order prescribed by the master. Every Sunday the attendees are sprinkled with the blood of the Lord, under the general outcry: Sanguis ejus super nos et super filios nostros! In the mass a thousand unworthinesses are committed: Some stick out their tongues, others blaspheme, others uncover their nakedness; all of which becomes even more boisterous at the elevation, since then the demons and the notables of the society, turning their backs to the sacrament, approach the altar. No singing is done at the mass, the lights smell foul; instead of Ite Missa est! the synagogue says: Allez \u00e0 tous les Diables! All the Psalms of David are sung, as in the church, but all directed to Lucifer, Beelzebub, Leviathan. The Pater noster is likewise turned toward Lucifer: Ego te accipio in patrem, qui in coelis es, sanctificetur nomen tuum per universum mundum --- --- et libera nos ab omni malo! The English greeting is directed in the same manner to the mother of the Antichrist: Salve virgo plarimum veneranda, plena gratiarum, Dominus tecum est etc. The Symbolum begins: Credo in Deum patrem Luciferum, qui creavit coelum et terram. Et in filium ejus Belzebub, qui conceptus est de spiritu sancto, qui reducit mundum, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in spiritum sanctum Leviathan, et Ecclesiam sanctam Catholicam, reformatam Synagogam, Communionem sanctorum, Remissionem peccatorum, et vitam aeternam, Amen. The Sabbath also keeps the ten commandments: Luciferum ut Deum verum adorabis, et alium extra ipsum non amabis. Nomen Jesu assidue blasphemabis. Sabbata Synagogae sanctificabis. Patrem ac matrem odio habebis. Viros pariter ac mulieres, puerosque trucidabis. Adulteria, et omnem fornicationem et crimina nefanda committere non dubitabis. Usuras, furta atque rapinas exercebis. Falsa testimonia ac mendacia dicundo praeelectabis. Uxorem proximi tui et possessionem proximi tui concupiscis. \\[Page 191\\]\n\nAs works of mercy are considered: to refuse food, drink, and clothing to the poor, not to take in the stranger, to abandon the weak and the imprisoned, to dig up the buried children for the Sabbath, to sow errors and heresies, to multiply doubts and scruples, to burden the afflicted with even greater affliction, to make those who have fallen into sin fall even deeper, not to pray for the deceased, to bear adversities with impatience. Mortal sins are held there to be: to live in humility, chastity, patience, moderation, compassion, and piety. For all virtues count as vices: extravagance stands in for chastity, gluttony for moderation, envy for neighborly love, avarice for generosity, pride for humility, impatience for long-suffering, and so too blasphemy for fortitude. Litanies are likewise held there, and in them, for example: *Ut Ecclesiam Catholicam apostolicam Romanam, per haereses turbare et destruere digneris, te rogamus audi nos*; *ut Ordines ac Religiones difformare et extirpare digneris*. --- *Ut congregationes nostras conservare in sanitate ab omni malo digneris*. --- *Ut rabiem nostram contra Deum et homines et Sanctos, qui sunt et futuri sunt, semper fovere digneris*. --- *Ut nos in cordis nostri duritie perpetuo retinere digneris*. --- *Ut nobis auxilium dones, ad resistendum semper spiritui sancto et divinis eius inspirationibus et admonitionibus, et quicquid saluti nostrae deseruire posset*. --- *Te rog"}, "Beelzebub's Sermon on Trinity Sunday at the Sabbath": {"start_char": 628990, "end_char": 631226, "pages": "191-192", "keywords": ["- sermon on trinity sunday"], "verbatim": "--- *Ut nos in cordis nostri duritie perpetuo retinere digneris*. --- *Ut nobis auxilium dones, ad resistendum semper spiritui sancto et divinis eius inspirationibus et admonitionibus, et quicquid saluti nostrae deseruire posset*. --- *Te rogamus audi nos*.\n\nOne sees that much from this ritual is still today useful for the secret service of many a doctrine that has purified the Sabbath, after cleansing it of all superstition and the ridiculous abstractions of the Middle Ages, and setting it upon tangibility, now holds it in broad daylight on the open market. Also a sermon that Beelzebub held on Trinity Sunday would be very useful; if one were to seat at the throne, instead of the obsolete three demons of the speaker, Leviathan's, and Asmodeus's, who sat there at that time --- their faces like a man's face, body, feet, and hands of a devil's feet, each with horns on the head, a golden tiara like the high priest --- three God-men: the God-philosopher, in whom pantheism has incarnated itself; the God-pleasure-seeker, husband of the exalted Lady Sophia of the Saint-Simonists; and the God-emperor of this world, in whom absolute liberal tyranny has become flesh.\n\nThe three could then speak from one mouth with the orator: My friends, today the great day of the most holy Trinity shines forth in humanity.

The Sabbath brought him in thanks there for many boy-sacrifices; but the inventor of the new poison-means was on that account elevated to t"}, "Sister Margaretha's Convulsions Healed by Miraculous Cloud from Sacrament": {"start_char": 658339, "end_char": 661181, "pages": "200-201", "keywords": ["- of sister margaretha of the holy sacrament"], "verbatim": "nfluences.\n\nSister Margaretha of the Holy Sacrament was thus, in her twelfth year, overtaken by violent convulsions, followed by a twelve-day state of half-sleep. Then a frightful condition came over her, from which only the laying on of a scapular freed her. Soon there followed such a heaviness in all her limbs that she could no longer hold herself on her feet, and, lying on the bed, could not move any of her leaden-heavy limbs; so that for seven to eight days she could scarcely take any food to herself. Then again, since all the doctors' remedies proved ineffective, violent convulsions followed. In this state one heard her call out with the accent of an enraptured soul: Let me regain my strength before the most holy Sacrament! The sisters resolved, upon her repeated cry, to carry the sick one into the choir; but when they tried to take the suppliant into their arms, none was able to lift her alone; only the strongest among them could at last, with unspeakable effort, bring her to the place. As soon as she had arrived at the door of the choir, there came, like a shining cloud from the tabernacle, which enveloped her and drove out the spirits. The cloud not only restored strength to her body, but made it so agile that she was sometimes carried from the choir door, at other times even from the cloister gate, as far as the altar railing. A wonderful peace descended upon her, and she, who through her illness had also lost the use of her sight, yet saw the object of her longing when it was exposed.\n\nOnce the efficacy of the remedy was known, they brought her from time to time into the choir and let her remain there for 3--4 hours; when she then returned to the sickroom, all her sufferings immediately returned. The doctors attributed her ills to a congestion of evil humors in the brain, and applied cupping to her head against it; she endured everything with the greatest resignation, although she well recognized the uselessness of the procedure. They then wanted to provide an outlet for the fluids between the skull and the brain membrane through trepanation. It was done, but no fluid nor vapor could be seen: everything was perfectly sound and healthy. This determined the superior, a wise and virtuous woman, to make a trial with obedience. In the convent was preserved the little cloak of the saintly Cardinal de B\u00e9rulle; this she laid upon her with the words: My sister, be healthy out of obedience to our most revered father! Immediately her convulsions ceased, which upon its return happened several times with the same success. At last the superior spoke the words: Be completely healthy in obedience, without convulsions, ravings, and blindness, and eat unhindered like the others. Immediately she was freed from all her ills, and henceforth ate without discomfort, as the doctors attested with official "}, "Possessions and Exorcisms in Louviers Convent Revealing Picard's Six Magics": {"start_char": 663798, "end_char": 664696, "pages": "201-202", "keywords": ["possessions and exorcisms in louviers convent revealing picards six magics"], "verbatim": " and the abhorrence and the putrefaction, the frothing of sin.\n\nVery instructive and significant is what occurred in the convent of Louviers regarding such things. As a result of the errors and confusions there, many nuns had become possessed; they were exorcised, and from the statements of their spirits it emerged that Picard had applied six different kinds of magic within the convent. One was composed to keep the nuns in constant discord; another, to awaken in their hearts a disordered inclination toward Picard and la Bavent; the third, to shake their chastity; the fourth, to awaken in them an inner aversion to faith, hope, and love, and to provoke blasphemies against God in them; the fifth, to arouse in them a desire for the Sabbath and all magic; the sixth, to produce in them a contempt and abhorrence toward all sacraments.

On 14 June 1643, in accordance with the declaration of the spirit in Sister Maria of the Holy Sacrament, who called himself Putiphar, in the evening between 7 and 8 in her chamber, from a wooden paneling of the walls that had never seemed to be opened, the first was drawn forth. The second, the last among those enumerated above, was found on the 30th of July under the high altar six feet deep under the earth. On the 19th in the evening at half eleven a third in the sacristy, from the same depth; and on the 24th of August at half twelve in the cloister between the four doors a fourth. On the 8th of September at eight o'clock in the evening another followed, nine feet deep under the pillar of the new building, brought to light in the presence of the Archbishop of Toulouse. Again two others on the epistle and gospel sides of the altar, from a depth of 6 to 8 feet; and yet a tenth on the 1st of December between 1 and 2 after midnight, in the interior of the choir, near the door; from a place that had more than twelve feet of depth. An eleventh and a twelfth then came still on the 22nd of January, and were drawn to the light from a depth of more than 7 feet, directly under the image of the Holy Virgin in her chapel,\n\nThe possessed now spoke with wonder, concerning all these magic instruments, those who had indicated their place even before they were found, circumstantially of their composition, of the inscriptions under which they had been fabricated on the Sabbath; they gave all their components, the ligatures and knots applied to them, the letters with which they were marked, and all other circumstances, without ever erring in the smallest detail. Before one began to dig, they designated some spot on the floor, and indicated: directly perpendicular beneath it, in a depth of 6 to 7, 8 to 9 up to 12 feet, the magic lay. One proceeded accordingly in digging, and always found it at the spot indicated by the exorcism. They stated: some were marked with the letters M. P. and M. B., the names of Picard and of Bavent; they testified that at a certain place lay the testament of David and Picard written in the Arabic language of the Sabbath; and everything was found exactly at the place they had indicated. No one could read and understand the writing; but the two nuns who had attested their presence read it one after the other, word for word, and explained it in agreement with each othe"}, "Precautions Against Fraud in Discovering Louviers Magics and Reactions of Possessed": {"start_char": 667450, "end_char": 669907, "pages": "203-204", "keywords": ["precautions against fraud in exorcism discoveries"], "verbatim": "\nIn all these things deception lay very near, and it is obvious that all these results are utterly worthless, if one did not employ all prudence to exclude the possibility of fraud. Let us see how it was handled in this regard. The next suspicion that had to arise was naturally: that the possessed, who descended into the pit to bring the hidden thing to light, had themselves carried it down with them. The appeal to their simplicity, education, and conscientiousness could here give no sure guarantee; because all that became invalid in the paroxysm. Therefore, before they descended into the pit, for greater security, they were most strictly searched by other sensible, prudent nuns of good judgment, and moreover unmolested by the spirits. With them other thoughtful persons, clerics and doctors, descended into the trench, who kept them sharply under watch, and never permitted them to come near the place where the amulets were hidden. One was accustomed to give the searchers a pole with a hook into their hand; and all had to remain at a distance from the spot as far as the pole reached, and to bring the magic to light from there with the point of the hook.\n\nMore than that, the edge of the trench was lined with other people who paid very close attention to the hands and all the movements of the possessed woman, and who would not easily have missed any practiced deception. It was advantageous that the time of discovery always fell at night; for now many torches were lit, which, properly distributed, mutually dispelled all shadows on the walls of the pit; so that everything stood in full light, which would not have been achievable by day. The Bishop of Embrun, who was present everywhere, moreover had the Most Blessed Sacrament held over the heads of the exorcised possessed woman in the pit at the decisive moment; in order to strike down any deceit also through the terrors of sacrilege. Despite all this caution, the result was always the same: the possessed woman dug up the earth at the indicated spot with her lance; the paper in which the charm was wrapped then became visible in its whiteness through a kind of glow; but it immediately clouded when touched by the air, and became dirty, moldy, and unsightly. But the possessed woman, in the instant when she perceived the hidden thing, was cast backward as if struck by a thunderbolt, uttered a terrible scream, and the spirits howled and roared out of her like wolves and tiger"}, "Alternative Method and Final Discoveries of Louviers Magics Without Possessed Entering Pit": {"start_char": 669923, "end_char": 671384, "pages": "204", "keywords": ["alternative method and final discoveries of louviers magics without possessed entering pit"], "verbatim": "\nSince all these precautionary measures that had been taken still did not fully dispel every doubt, as long as the nuns descended into the pit; the method of procedure was also changed in this respect when searching for the last three talismans. The one buried under the choir door was exhumed on 15 December 1645, and two others in the Loreto chapel on 3 January; so that the possessed woman, kept far from the edge of the trench, indicated the spot from outside with a 15-foot-long pole, where the buried item was then found, without the finder ever approaching it. The last one was likewise indicated by the possessed woman from outside the trench, with her face turned away; as she thrust the pole into the earth at one spot, and then ordered them to dig further. From time to time she then called out: One moment more! At last she made a violent thrust, always with her face turned away; and immediately the little package came to light, two finger-breadths from the tip of her pole. Skepticism now had to yield to the evidence of the facts, and the commissioners, sent on behalf of the queen and the council of state, with the Archbishop of Toulouse at their head, issued an authentic testimony as to with what caution and deliberation the proceedings had been conducted in their presence; how they had placed the searching nun between them, and how the paper, white and intact at the first finding, had become moldy, dissolved, and dirty under their eyes"}, "Suspected Trickery During One Louviers Magic Discovery": {"start_char": 670691, "end_char": 672388, "pages": "204", "keywords": ["suspected trickery during one louviers magic discovery"], "verbatim": "From time to time she then called out: One moment more!

In the case of one who had thus called out, the outcome seemed indeed to confirm the warning. She had indicated a spot with her 12-foot rod; they searched and could find nothing. They therefore emptied a portion of the earth at the bishop's feet to examine it; the bishop held the hands of the possessed woman in his own.

A case in which all circumstances, well considered, and the confessions of those involved taken into aid, hardly offers any other explanation than through conscious transfer, is the story of Renata S\u00e4nger, who at the end of the first half of the previous century ascended the stake. She was, according to the intelligently written report that the Premonstratensian Oswald Loschert, abbot of the monastery of Oberzell, as an eyewitness wrote down immediately after her death, and sent to Empress Maria Theresa, born around 1680 in Munich, and without the knowledge of her parents already in early youth in contact with suspicious people, and thus initiated into various traditional magical arts circulating among them.\n\nTaught by an old woman, she had already begun these studies in her seventh year; a rider had then continued the begun work in her ninth; and in the eleventh and thirteenth, two officers, a maid, and a noble lady had successively joined. From them she had received various magical herbs, especially a root of great power, and a little black man, which however soon disappeared again, probably a mandrake; various talismans with numbers and letters and incantations of all kinds, and learned many arts: to make people sick at will by her blowing upon them, by fixed gazing, accompanied by reciting certain formulas, by needle pricks into specifically shaped figures, by placing the herbs under the door threshold, or by communicating falsified foods, to drive them out of their senses, or to plunge them into demonic relations. Here one sees the aftereffect of the Thirty Years' War, whose terrible dissolution, barbarization, and despair had recently brought forth all these traditions of malice from earlier centuries, further developed them, and spread them among all classes, especially the lower ones and the wild soldiery. In the practice of these arts she soon became visionary; she heard, gazing into the distance, what was secretly spoken of her here and there; she saw herself at the Sabbath, with the change of her name to Emma Renata, entered into the black book, and received seventy years of life promised in exchange for her renunciation. All this was now a poor preparatory school for the monastic life that she, compelled by her parents who were unable to do otherwise, around 1699 entered in the monastery of Unterzell, which was highly esteemed for its discipline and strictness. \\[Page 236\\]\n\nHad she been endowed with a less resolute character, and possessed less mastery over herself than was truly the case; then this disproportion would have had to lead to a swifter outbreak. But resolute as she was, once she had taken her side, she went her ways in silence, without letting anything outwardly be noticed. She submitted herself to all the rigor of discipline; was careful in the fulfillment of her order's duties, and even knew how to spread around herself an appearance of piety; so that many held her in high esteem, and her convent sisters appointed her subprioress; indeed, they would have elected her prioress, if not a frequent dissatisfaction with her state, often rushing into it, a persistent aversion against her superiors, and a continuing restlessness on account of inner concerns, which she only hinted at with half words and would confide to no one, had held her back from it. This uncanny quality in her being, combined with the dark seclusion in which she set herself apart from all, also brought it about that for many years she came into no closer intercourse or more intimate association with any of her fellow sisters; which in turn preserved these from contagion by her arts, which she ceaselessly practiced for herself, drawing the herbs in the convent garden, and procuring from outside whatever else she lacked. Meanwhile it could not fail to happen that her heart must have embittered itself in this isolation; the compulsion to outward hypocrisy, alongside the secret practice of wicked arts, must have, ever increasing the tornness of her nature, filled her with resentment and hatred. This was greatly augmented still further by outward circumstances that arose; such as when in the year 1738 the provost of the convent removed the many cats with which she surrounded herself---already characteristic of her disposition, even if they did not, as she later confessed, hang together with her sorcery---on account of the great unrest they caused. Her mind, it seems, was thereby embittered to the depths, and from then on she began to direct her arts against those who had drawn her hatred upon themselves. From this moment onward peace and quiet had fled from the community of sisters; and the convent became the scene of the strangest events. Nightly there arose tumult and unrest within and without the cells; now it seemed to the sisters as if coaches and wagons were driving through the dormitory; now they heard in the garden, beneath the windows of the same, an unusual clamor. When they lay in their beds, then they were pressed, struck, pinched, and strangled; so that in the morning they could scarcely stir, and more than once bore blue marks from it; the locking of the cell, the sprinkling with holy water, and the blessing helped for a time, but never in the long run. Once when one of the convent women, on such an occasion, struck about her with her scourge, and the tormenting spirit fled from her after she seemed to have hit it hard, there was seen early in the morning on Renata's eye a bloody mark; which indeed awakened some suspicion against her, but naturally led to no certainty. But soon others fell gravely ill, and it was noticed that it was always the best, and those most useful to the convent, who in this manner were suddenly, and as if struck by evil sorcery, afflicted with burdensome and painful illnesses. This fate befell four in succession within the convent walls; and it was soon observed that the evil also spread outside of them, in a striking manner, to the male and female relatives of the provost. In five other sisters there soon appeared symptoms of another kind. \\[Page 237\\]\n\nThey retired to rest, then they came---without really sleeping---out of themselves; and in this state, having become clairvoyant, they now saw various persons standing before them, among these also Renata; who tormented them in every conceivable manner and way, without their being able to stir themselves, to defend, or even to cry out. On the whole following day they were then tormented by inner anxieties, which especially multiplied in the church; from which they were often driven out against their will, as by an irresistible force. When they went to choir, their voice was alternately taken away and restored, and their singing in between transformed into a hideous howling; whereby the throat sometimes swelled high, and then fell together again. All this was connected with trembling, head-shaking, striking of hands and breast, and various convulsive movements; accompanied by the feeling as if an animal moved in their body; great despondency and despairing thoughts joined themselves likewise to these evils.\n\nAll who had been seized by this state were, according to the testimony of the doctors, previously of good bodily constitution; their mental powers were unimpaired, their conduct showed itself blameless. Thus neither in a natural cause nor in a sinful play of lies could the ground of those hitherto unheard-of effects be sought; but no one thought of possession and sorcery. Among the sick was also C\u00e4cilia Pistorini from Amberg, and from this one the spirit had begun to speak in 1745, named his name, and predicted much of the future; but since she did not speak in foreign languages and nothing very remarkable, one still took offense at advising possession. Moreover, one was not sure of her as one who had only recently been in the convent; and that had brought her many humiliations and hard trials from the side of the superior. Renata had been very active in this; she persecuted the afflicted one, on whom she had cast a hatred, to the utmost; and since on account of her age and understanding she stood in some esteem with many, she took all pains to teach those in the convent: there are neither witches nor possessed, and what showed itself in C\u00e4cilia was a pretended thing, mixed with many punishable disorders. In the meantime, however, no one could see what the unfortunate one drove to such a play; one had previously, when her states began to show themselves, given her leave to leave the convent; with tears in her eyes she had begged for her admission, to all trials she had willingly submitted with humility and obedience.\n\nShe herself, when her mouth in her attacks spoke terrible blasphemies, or to her shame blurted out the secrets of her heart, and the most terrible convulsions shook her; then she nevertheless never wanted to be persuaded that she was really possessed; she held herself only for one who on account of her sins had been abandoned and rejected by God. In the meantime, however, one had at last decided on the application of exorcism on her, this had not missed its effect; but the states had always returned again, and one had then each time noticed: that Renata had come close to her shortly before, breathed on her, murmured some words to her, or made some gestures; and it had then each time been to her as if a fireball passed through her body, whereupon the convulsions immediately set in again. That must of course awaken suspicion; all the more, since also one of the sick convent women, who on account of her spirit and her exceptional piety stood in great veneration in the convent, on her deathbed had repeatedly testified against Renata. \\[Page 238\\]\n\nBut they still took scruple at allowing themselves to be prompted by this to any measure against her; and instead ordered a general church prayer in the convent: to implore from above help in the heavy distress, and light in the dark matter. The devotion had been continued for about three days; when the mouths of two more among the five opened, whose spirits had hitherto been mute; and amid the most violent convulsions it cried forth from them: Alas, our time has come, we may no longer conceal ourselves; whereby they, as ones compelled thereto by higher power, testified against Renata as the originator of all the evils. When one immediately applied the exorcism against them, they confirmed what had earlier been said voluntarily.\n\nA few weeks later the remaining three also began to speak, and all six now unanimously attested the same; so that, as at the same time the torments and plagues of the afflicted were raised to the highest pitch, and no one could any longer doubt a real possession, general mourning arose in the convent, from which even Renata did not outwardly withdraw herself. The spirits, however, did not cease to testify against her; they gave the year, day and hour, place and occasion with the utmost exactness, where she there four or six, there ten and eleven years before had wrought evil; so that finally the long-spun net over the unfortunate one had to draw itself together. Her superiors had, in praiseworthy calm and moderation, still taken scruple at doing her any harm; until finally the provost of the convent found it advisable to carry out that upon which Renata herself, out of hatred against C\u00e4cilia, had pressed for a year and a day; by requesting the abbot of Oberzell to institute a formal investigation of the matter. This one came over, examined the convent sisters under oath, and found Renata so multiply implicated through their statements, that he could not refrain from separating her for the time being from the rest of the convent.\n\nShe herself, when questioned about the accusations, had steadfastly maintained her innocence; and when the abbot pronounced the separation against her, she had begged to be allowed to go once more to her cell beforehand, in order to take with her some writings containing matters of conscience and confession; which was naturally not permitted to her, and now in the investigation the ointment box, various magic herbs, a yellow robe and the like were found. When, at her imprisonment, the possessed were quickly brought near, it began to howl and lament miserably from them, and it cried forth from some: O ye accursed hounds! why will ye destroy our nest? O little love---thus they called Renata---do not forsake us! The confessor of the convent now gave himself all effort to bring the unfortunate one to a sincere confession and to a conversion of life; and it seemed to him in so far to succeed, that she not only to him outside of confession, but also to the superiors of the convent quite voluntarily laid the confession: that she was a sorceress, had learned sorcery outside the convent, and had brought the six possessed into the state in which they found themselves; and that indeed with all the circumstances as the voices from them had earlier spoken. \\[Page 239\\]\n\nThere was now no exercise of repentance, no renunciation and abjuration, which Renata did not repeat after the priests with all outward signs of contrition; thereby showing such composure of mind as if she had never committed any evil. When she was alone in solitude, then one saw her lying on her knees before the crucifix, or reciting the rosary; so that, to judge thereby, a complete change seemed to have taken place in her. But the nightly torments of the possessed continued as before and after, and Renata was always visible to them therein as a helper; although meanwhile a lay sister did not let her out of her sight in her room.\n\nThe voices only mocked with their pretended conversion, and in doing so revealed blasphemies that they had committed during their confinement without the presence of a single human being; so that one again began to doubt the sincerity of their improvement; doubts which were later justified by her own confession.\n\nUp to this point, the whole matter had been kept secret and confined within the cloister walls, and in accordance with the manner of ecclesiastical procedure in such cases, in the hope that a way might be found to settle the affair quietly, every public step and summoning of witnesses had been avoided. But the cries and howls of the demons from the possessed became so noisy that they resounded throughout the entire region around the cloister; from one of them they had betrayed to the visiting elders the condition of their daughter, and accused Renata as the originator; so that soon the rumor of what was happening spread all around. They now first resorted to a new confessor; Father Maurus from the Scottish monastery in W\u00fcrzburg was summoned, in the hope that he might perhaps succeed in moving her heart. Her confessions, tears, and contrition at first made him believe that he had succeeded; but new events in the cloister, and the continuing accusations of the possessed, soon led him to doubt his opinion again.\n\nThe confrontation with her accusers brought her to new confessions of ongoing misdeeds, and to repeated vows of improvement; on which occasion she, among other things, declared: how she would no longer be able to do harm if she were taken to another place. One doubted the truth of this statement; for in the meantime the nightly unrest would not subside, and indeed several voices were heard speaking with Renata at night on more than one occasion, and then, at a horn call, she rose up from them like a light cloud; moreover, since the voices of the possessed threatened her with death, and once even suddenly hacked in the outermost door of the place of her confinement with an axe that happened to be seized, it was believed necessary to agree to her removal from the cloister. The matter was therefore reported to the Prince-Bishop, and a request was made for the dispatch of a commission, so that this commission might examine Renata, and, according to the findings, order her safekeeping in Marienberg Castle. \\[Page 240\\]\n\nIt happened as the petitioners wished; the bishop at that time, with some companions of both ecclesiastical and secular estates, among whom there were also some physicians, appeared in the cloister, and above all had the possessed nuns brought forward. One addressed him with these words: Cur venis in brevibus, ei non in longis vestibus? Another jumped out the window before the eyes of the assembly, laughed and made noise, holding onto the window frame, and was soon back in the room just as quickly. Yet another seized the bishop by the arm, pulled him out of the room with her to the cell in which Renata was locked up; hastily she took off her slipper from her foot, struck the padlock, and it opened. The commission then withdrew again, and the scenes in the cloister continued their course once more. All the sisters prayed for Renata, the possessed offered up their torments for her; and one after the other, after a terrible attack had preceded in each, delivered, driven by her spirit, an address to her, praising God's long-suffering, but also threatening her with His wrath; so that tears came to the eyes of all those present. She alone stood obstinate; she did indeed confess the misdeeds that the spirits charged her with, but at the same time asserted: her time was not yet up; and when once all the possessed unanimously pressed in upon her to compel her to renounce the pact and hand over the magic root, she did deliver some herbs and men's hairs that she had managed to keep even in her dungeon; but at the same time, suspicious events were reported again.\n\nFinally, the spirits had granted her, as the last period of grace, three more days; when these had passed, Renata suddenly collapsed in the presence of the possessed, as if struck by lightning, at the feet of the confessor---so that he thought her dead, and the spirits howled triumphantly. She came to herself again, however, and was now, while the possessed were handed over to medical care in W\u00fcrzburg, brought in secular clothes to Castle Marienberg, and her trial immediately instituted. During the same, she continuously gave all signs of true repentance; but the torments in the monastery and among the possessed would not cease on that account. \\[Page 241\\]\n\nThey disregarded it and did not stop. She was still seen at night, as she with others inflicted these torments; the hands and faces of the maltreated showed traces in the morning, and various objects were found in the beds, which had been dragged from other places in the monastery for this purpose. The possessed were alternately freed through the exorcisms and newly afflicted again; and the spirits continuously testified from them against Renata. She was therefore interrogated repeatedly, and since she persisted in her previous confessions and continuously admitted herself guilty of sorcery, she was finally declared forfeit of all spiritual privileges and immediately handed over to the secular courts: which, after a newly conducted investigation, condemned her according to the laws on sorcery to the fire; which the highest authority mitigated to the effect that she should first be executed with the sword. The judgment was executed on the sixth of February 1629; both at the announcement and at the execution, Renata remained calm and composed, and the external signs of repentance continued as b"}, "Demonic Possession Epidemic in Quercy Convent (1491)": {"start_char": 783678, "end_char": 786359, "pages": "243-244", "keywords": ["- possession in quercy convent 1491"], "verbatim": "The possession requires no such mediation; the negating unity strikes immediately into a personality, makes it its shell, and the one thus sporadically seized does not, as a rule, spread further infection around herself. But this striking can also happen simultaneously into many individuals, and these, placed near to one another by their calling and other circumstances of life, then enter into rapports with one another, and with the invisible center, which altogether has an epidemic character. One easily comprehends that such states have great affinity with those of epidemic obsessions, and form the transitions between the being afflicted and the being attacked. First, such cases will present themselves where, although the suspicion may well have pointed to a personal center, nothing certain has been ascertained about it. Thus Mass\u00e4us says: In the year 1491, around the feast of Peter's Chair, the demons began to inhabit and possess the convent of the nuns of Quercy (Quercetensium), and to torment its inhabitants most cruelly for four years and four months. One saw them frequently running through the fields like dogs, flying in the air like birds, climbing trees in the manner of cats, hanging from the branches, imitating the voices of various animals, penetrating secrets, and prophesying future things. \\[Page 243\\]\n\nSo often Heinrich, Bishop of Cambrai, or Aegidius Nettetet, Dean of his church, both pious men, set out for exorcism, they knew it beforehand, and cried: The one with the horns is again on the way to threaten us. After all manner of means had been applied, which were sought out from everywhere, their names were brought to Rome and read out by Alexander VI on Maundy Thursday under the Mass; but without any effect. Johanna Potier, who was held to be the beginning of the evil, had been in confidential relations with the demon from her ninth year onward, and this one accused her in the convent: that she had gone to Communion 434 times unworthily; which statement, however, since he is a liar from the beginning, cannot be trusted. She was led to Cambrai and died in the dungeon on St.\u00a0Martin's Day; the others were freed in June after four years of possession. Joh. Molinet in his Belgian chronicle for the year 1490 confirms these accounts, adding: that the evil had passed from one to the other innocents. The demons had given themselves out as angels of light who belonged to the hierarchy of the Seraphim, and had at last been driven out by the Dean of Cambrai. He had carried the Eucharist to the sick, and set the demons the condition: if it were nothing but bread, then it might by no means disturb them in their possession; but if t"}, "Possession Epidemic in Kentorp Convent and Spread to Hamm": {"start_char": 785885, "end_char": 790808, "pages": "244-245", "keywords": ["- possession in quercy convent 1491"], "verbatim": "Molinet in his Belgian chronicle for the year 1490 confirms these accounts, adding: that the evil had passed from one to the other innocents.

He had carried the Eucharist to the sick, and set the demons the condition: if it were nothing but bread, then it might by no means disturb them in their possession; but if the body of the Lord, then they must withdraw from the possessed.\n\nWier, whose testimony as a physician and Protestant one may here allow to stand,\u00b9 even if he had the weakness of believing in the devil, has recorded several other cases of this kind from his own experience. In the convent of Kentorp, in the county of Mark not far from Hamm, the enclosed nuns, noblewomen as well as others, were seized by a possession; and the individuals in various ways, some more violently, others more mildly, tormented. In this variety, however, there was one thing common to all: that as soon as one was seized by an attack, all the others, even if they were in completely separate rooms, as soon as they heard the noise, were likewise drawn into it and miserably plagued. Anna Lemgon was one of the older and stout-hearted sisters who clearly explained to the physician Wier the circumstances of the whole evil. It began with her, who was one of the first seized, with pains in the left hypochondrium; she was held to be seized by epilepsy, and was sent to the convent of Nonnery so that she might drink from the skull of the holy Cornelius; she did so, and the nuns now falsely said that she was better. \\[Page 244\\]\n\nBut when she was soon more violently visited by the evil, and other nuns were likewise found drawn into it; a soothsayer was consulted, who gave testimony against the convent's cook as the originator of the evil. Now the malignancy of the plague increased; the convulsions became more manifold and more deeply cutting, and the seized were driven to bite one another, and so also other strangers, to strike and throw down; yet without further harm, since they seemed to themselves as light as feathers, and now noticed that they were not masters of themselves. If they were held back from striking or the other acts of violence, they were pressed in the heart; but if they were let loose again, they felt, even if they injured or bit themselves, no evil at all; so that it seemed as if it had become a necessity for them to rage against their own bodies. If Anna gave herself to prayer, she could by no means follow it with attention or move her tongue for it; but if she merely chattered off her hours thoughtlessly, then she was in no way hindered from it; it rather seemed to her as if she were thereby relieved and refreshed.\n\nShe could not think seriously about any good or evil matter; it seemed to her then as if she were stupid in spirit, without sense, without distinction, and without judgment. If a religious, God-consecrated man addressed her, she was as it were scolded by the devil on that account; but if she spoke with this one, or with another female person, about vain and trivial things, then she was wonderfully uplifted and exalted thereby. Although all were plagued in manifold ways, they were nevertheless all of good appetite, and the nourishment proceeded well. From here the malady now soon spread also to the nearby city of Hamm, afflicting not a few citizens of this city with various torments. When they were instructed by the pastor of the place in his room, and he had them recite the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer; they began to question one another, and the demons now named themselves with jesting names, as one said: he was called Flederwisch, another Flatfoot, the third Rosenbaum; but he who now wrought mischief in the monastery at Kentorp named himself Hornuar.\n\nAt last one asked: The pastor wants to drive us out; what shall we do now? The other replied: I will ride on a black buck to that woman whom he named; I shall be a dear guest to her. The other said: he would go with the same conveyance to a second one. Both, sitting backward on chairs like fools, now seemed, as gesture and voice indicated, to ride to the aforementioned places; without, however, having moved from the spot. A third, rolled and drawn together like a ball, rushed toward the closed door; and as this was suddenly opened, he fell down the stairs, but entirely unharmed. In the place Houel near Hamm, likewise many possessed persons came to light. Also in another neighboring city the inhabitants were seized by similar attacks and plagues, on account of which many investigations arose there against individuals. As in this case the manifestation of possession often hovers midway between malice and jest; so the contagion that produced it hovers between a moral and a physical one. \\[Page 245\\]\n\nThe "}, "Possessions in Houel and Neighboring City Near Hamm": {"start_char": 789866, "end_char": 790542, "pages": "245", "keywords": ["- of possession in shared sleeping hall"], "verbatim": "The other replied: I will ride on a black buck to that woman whom he named; I shall be a dear guest to her.

Wondrous was the plague of a number of nuns in the monastery of Werte in the county of Horn. The beginning of it was traced there to a poor woman who, during Lent, had borrowed a quart, about three pounds of salt, from the monastery, and had returned the loan nearly double by Easter. Now white pellets were found in the dormitory, resembling sugar-coated seeds in appearance, but of salty taste; these, however, were not eaten, and no one knew how they had come there. Then something was heard sighing about there, like a sick person; voices were also sometimes heard inviting several of the virgins to rise and go with it to the fire, for it was sick. If they really got up to look after the sick sister, they found no one. If one of them wanted to relieve herself into the chamber pot, it was violently snatched from her, and the bed besmirched with what had been passed. Sometimes they were dragged out of bed a few steps, and tickled under the soles of their feet in such a way that they feared they must die from excessive laughter.\n\nSeveral pieces of flesh were torn out from some; but from many others, their legs, arms, and faces were twisted backward. Some of those thus tormented, although they had taken nothing for 59 days but turnip broth with bread, nevertheless vomited up a black substance like ink in great quantities; it was so sharp and bitter that it ate away the hands in their mouths. Some were lifted up above the heads of the people and thrown down again. Once, when the sick were calmed and therefore very cheerful, about thirteen friends visited the convent at the same time; the nuns were thrown senseless and speechless from the table, so that several lay there with twisted arms and legs as if dead. One was lifted up, and although those present laid hands to resist, she was nevertheless torn out above their heads and then dashed down again in such a way that she lay there as if dead. Afterward she came to herself as if from a deep sleep and walked about unharmed. Some walked supported on the ends of their leg bones, without making use of their feet, which they dragged after them as if entirely loosened from their ligaments. \\[Page 246\\]\n\nThey climbed the trees like cats and crept down them again without making any movement of the body. The worthy mother of the convent, while she was engaged in conversation with the noble and pious Margaretha, Countess of Bur, had a piece of flesh torn from her loins. She cried out in pain and was carried to bed; but the wound suppurated in part, and in part it was black; however, she was healed. Once, when two of the afflicted nuns were sitting together laughing and cheerful, and speaking with one another of a black cat that a matron of the town, whom they named, had sent locked in a basket into the dormitory; a third healthy one had secretly listened to their talk, and the prioress had examined the basket with her and two or three others, whereupon the cat then jumped away. For this reason the woman was accused of maleficium, and thrown into the dungeon with seven others.

When the bailiff thereupon offered her food according to custom, she declared: she was too weak to eat, but begged for something to drink. When the drink was immediately handed to her by the bailiff, she seized his garment and, leaning on him, immediately breathed out her life.

Still much other wondrous things were to be seen there, and the evil lasted three full years, and was afterward driven out.\n\nIt was probably one of those kobolds at play here, who brought this woman, who was most likely innocent, to misfortune. The Brigittines at Fanten were likewise visited with manifold demonic plagues. Jumping about, they sometimes uttered a roaring and frightful noise; they were at times driven out of their appointed seats in the church, and their veils torn off; also their throats were sometimes closed so that they could take no food. The manifold changing and harsh affliction lasted among most of them for ten years. The cause was sought in a maiden who had formerly been inflamed with love for a youth whom her parents would not admit into their kinship. As she was now in great sorrow on this account, the demon persuaded her, in the form of the youth, to take the vow in the convent, and she allowed herself to be clothed. Once received into the order, she was seized as if by a frenzy and gave all a horrible, manifold changing spectacle. Her affliction now communicated itself, like a contagion, to many other sisters; who then, based on her own confession, held her to be the cause of all their misery.\n\nWith her, who was subsequently captured and taken away, the jailer begot two children; she was then released, and lived on, burdened with the suspicion of maleficium. The matter had occurred a considerable time before in Marienbaum; he therefore wrote for information to a nun there, and she replied: there were still two nearly eighty-year-olds from that time remaining, and from them she had often heard talk of it. They said: for much would they not have wished to forgo this heavy misfortune, ordained by God; because they had felt what gifts of grace and enlightenment had been granted to them from it; which their lives also bore witness to. At that time many learned people had been sent for, who had closely examined the terrible appearances, and attempted to penetrate into their interior and to provide help. But the more trust one placed in their advice, the more violent the evil became. \\[Page 247\\]\n\nThen the afflicted finally recognized the matter as God's work; submitting themselves from the whole heart to his mighty arm, and completely denying themselves, they had ordered their lives according to God's Word, and now the evil gradually vanished. Wier adds: how he himself had visited the convent, and made inquiry with one of the old women who had borne the evil for ten years. She likewise praised God for it, and said: that she, if age permitted, would gladly let the same floods of misfortune pass over her once more. She counseled me: that if I should ever be consulted by such sufferers, I should certainly never permit exorcism. One who was such a suffering sister was, on the advice of some, beaten with rods by her brother; as madmen still advise today, as if the demon could be driven out with rods. She, however, from shame and displeasure, gradually wasted away: but in dying she sang; and when asked about the cause of her singing, she answered: because she did not doubt her eternal salvation.

The greater part of them---there were about seventy in the house---were possessed by evil spirits, and were plagued and tormented in manifold ways. They climbed like cats up walls and roofs. Their faces, when they began to grow angry, they distorted so hideously and gruesomely that, if one looked upon them, even the most stouthearted man's hair stood on end. Often they ran toward the water as if they intended to drown themselves; but as soon as they reached the edge of it, they stood stock-still and said: The great man (as they were wont to call God) will not permit it. In general, whenever they wished to do something evil but could not bring it to pass, they always said: that the great man forbade it. They spoke, in the expression of Laurenz Regals, with playing tongues, all sorts of foreign languages which they had yet never learned; and they knew---what astonished people the most---to recount what was being handled at that very moment in the town hall. \\[Page 248\\]\n\nReaal reports on it: one of the children, in a fit, told the orphanage mother Catharina Gereits that the council was still assembled and had just resolved to send her son Johann Clae\u00df to The Hague. It was found that this was indeed the resolution. The council had indeed deliberated on it and withdrawn the sending; but the child had nonetheless seen correctly. In their possession, the children were accustomed to raging and raving terribly, especially before the doors of certain women. In particular, one named Bametie was hateful to them; they unanimously accused her of having bewitched them, and against her they now poured out all their malice; so that these women were always held suspect on that account and cried out as sorceresses. But this suspicion fell most heavily on Bametie, because she was already blamed for having been out many times at night to practice her juggling or sorcery. Moreover, she had also been found many times in the Holy Ghost Chapel (Amsterdam was still Catholic in its government at that time) as if dead and entranced, with hands and feet spread wide apart, stretched out on the floor before the altar; and she would then come back to herself after several hours out of this ecstasy, with deep-drawn sighs.\n\nThe aforementioned orphans, when they had climbed up the tower of the old church like cats and played on the carillon bells with their fingers, were accustomed to sing in loud voices from her: We will not go away from here until we see Bametie sitting in the fire. At times they also pointed with their fingers at a spot, as if they wanted to show the bystanders the witch; who, however, was then of course not to be seen despite all efforts, although the children cried: she had just come there to do them some harm. They were also, no one knew why, exceedingly enraged against the schulthei\u00df, reviling and scolding him harshly, and calling him a Deventer cake; either on account of his long, lean figure, or because he let them open their mouths with this children's fare to stop their scolding. ---\n\nThe children slept together in one hall, and thus the contagion can easily be understood. But one also sees clearly in this case: that the infected, when no visible center is present from which their evil has proceeded, seek out such a one for themselves; around which they then unite. It is understandable that a center of this sort must have an analogous state dwelling in it to their own, and that seems to have been the case with this woman. She had, as it is written, convulsions; whether these were of a higher mystical kind, or demonic, has not been ascertained. Probably, if we give weight to her evil reputation, brought about by her nocturnal outings, they alternated intermittently with one another; wher"}, "Affliction Plague in Hoorn Orphanage (1670)": {"start_char": 802099, "end_char": 806605, "pages": "249-250", "keywords": ["- possession in hoorn orphanage 1670"], "verbatim": "It is understandable that a center of this sort must have an analogous state dwelling in it to their own, and that seems to have been the case with this woman.

As, moreover, in the higher order of things, connections form themselves in love and attractive instincts; so in this lower one through hatred and repulsion; the choruses are thus scolding, armed against their choir leader, and striving against him.\n\nSomething over a hundred years later, in the orphanage of Hoorn in 1670, something quite similar occurred. At that time in this house there was a very large number of children, --- both boys and girls, older and younger, but none under twelve years, and mostly all of the most unruly sort ---, afflicted for several months with a severe plague; on account of which many doctors were consulted, who did not know what to make of the matter. \\[Page 249\\]\n\nBut the plague consisted in this: that the aforementioned children suddenly and unexpectedly fell to the ground, and as soon as they came to themselves, they were pulled and torn with such force that it was unbearable to witness: how they trampled with their legs, knocked their heads against the earth, struck about with their arms, gnashed their teeth, and howled and barked like dogs. In some, the belly rose and fell so violently that it seemed as if a living creature sat within it, which was moving; or as if little barrels were being rolled about in their bodies. They then had to be held by three, four, five, or sometimes even by six people; of whom one held the head, two others the hands, one sat on the legs, and sometimes a fourth had to press down the belly. When they lay still, they were stiff and rigid like wood; so that if one grasped them only by the head and the feet, one could carry them wherever one wished, without their making the slightest movement. This often lasted for several hours in succession, even into the night until twelve, one, or two o'clock.\n\nOne of them, the daughter of Tryn Lucas, one of the oldest orphans in the house, was seized by the plague early in the morning around eight, when the morning bell rang for breakfast. The attack lasted without any interruption until four in the afternoon, when the bell rang again for vespers. The sick girl thought, when she came to herself again, that she had only lain in the attack for a short time, because she believed she heard the morning bell ringing once more. These attacks most often came upon the children when they saw others seized by it; or also when they merely heard someone in the plague gnashing their teeth, or howling and barking. Some therefore were accustomed to run away at once, but mostly in vain; unless they happened to be near the gate and could leave the house. Thus, through hearing and seeing, so many often contracted it that there was scarcely enough household staff to be found to help them. Secondly, it also fell upon them very frequently, and almost always, during spiritual exercises, for example under the sermon, from which they therefore had to be kept away; then during the catechetical instruction, which the preachers gave in the house from time to time; but most of all during the prayers, which were recited aloud by the assistant masters. \\[Page 250\\]\n\nThe more earnest and fervent these prayers were, the more God was implored therein to curb the power of Satan; the worse the children had it, and they fell into the plague all the more. During the days of carnival, almost an entire week long, the afflicted were the most unbound and reckless children; indeed so unrestrained, as if they were full of fire and inner burning. Throughout the whole time they could not be tamed, and the plague was in this period, as it were, hidden and suspended. No remedy helped the children, except first of all prayer, which, at the request of the superintendents and the house mother, was constantly observed in all churches and assemblies by all except the Catholics. Furthermore, that the afflicted were allowed to live outside the house with other citizens. When they were away, they soon felt improvement, and the plague began gradually to diminish; so that they were all, sooner or later, de"}, "Demonic Traces and Sabbath Visions in Ryssel Institution": {"start_char": 806680, "end_char": 807778, "pages": "251", "keywords": ["- in hands vision in possession"], "verbatim": " returned from time to time.

A young man, about 16 years old, of dull comprehension, mentally and physically not of particular drive or vigor, had become conspicuous to his fellow pupils: through the strange gestures, eye-rollings and contortions of his body, which manifested themselves in him. He had let them eat ripe cherries in the middle of winter; and after first offering them to them, he had then eaten them himself. In the church he had shown them his empty hands, and then taken money from the pews, and asserted: that he did all this with the help of an evil spirit, which he called Serug. \\[Page 257\\]\n\nThey had once caught him at it, how he had drawn a circle with chalk in the school, and described it with some figures and numbers, which Bekker had seen. On being asked: what does that mean? he had stood long silent and still, and blinked with his eyes; but finally confessed: that he had drawn it to speak with him through it. Likewise, when asked: how he had come by the cherries and the money? he had replied, that he had given it to him. Asked: who this he might be? he had, blinking again and looking in front of him, named Beelzebub. Into a hole in the wall, which according to the rector's deputy was much too small to admit his hand, he had nevertheless thrust it in, and upon pulling it out had torn a stone along with it. More sharply questioned, he explained: that the spirit sometimes appeared to him, now agreeably as a maiden, now repulsively as a goat; that it had happened to him for the first time in Leeuwarden, where money for playing had been lacking to him, and that he had given him a handwriting.\n\nThe school authorities resolved to exclude him from it, and to inform the parents of the matter; who now agreed upon it, to keep him at home. A maid watched over him during the day, wherever he went and stood; at night he slept with his brother, who was a clever man, and entirely capable for this guardianship. They prayed for him in the church; the maid was accustomed to seat him in front of the pulpit, where he was exposed to the eyes of many people as well as the preacher. There he would then sit stiffly looking in front of him, often blinking, more frequently shaking with his feet, like one who is freezing, and suffering from a twitching of the sinews, as epileptics are wont to have; without, however, ever having fallen in the church.\n\nThe maid knew much to tell about him, but this rested only on her belief; because the father, who loved solitude, mostly remained in his chamber; but the mother, although very sensible and attentive, was very burdened with bodily weakness. He presented himself to Bekker as if he felt remorse and sorrow, but took no heart toward the one who scolded him more often; for which reason this one henceforth spoke more kindly with him, and once took him, with the prior knowledge of the parents, on a walk; after having previously bought him some sweets for him, with which, as he very well knew, his trust was most easily to be gained. He now told him on this walk: how his spirit Serug still kept him company, and spoke invisibly with him in various shapes; and that he, in order not to be tormented, still sometimes yielded to him in evil.\n\nHe wanted to lure him out continually, and although he had little desire for it, he had nevertheless been very well entertained by him twice at special places: first in the little house by the gallows at Leeuwarden, which then transformed into a beautiful hall; and then in Franeker, on the first piece of pastureland that lies northward from the road by the city moat. There was a pit there, which, except on the hottest summer days, is otherwise mostly full of water; that pit had suddenly dried up at that time, and been full of fiery flames. In it many devils had been flying about, who declared that hell indeed had such a fire as well; but they knew how to render it harmless. To a company of men and women who had been there, splendid fare had been served; there had also been music, dancing, and games. \\[Page 258\\]\n\nPeople had spoken Hebrew there; a language which he understood as well as his mother tongue, but outside the assembly not at all. He named those present, among others a woman from Leeuwarden who already had a reputation for this. At night, after he had slept a little, his spirit would make him rise; and lead him along a height which he never saw by day, to that place. Once he had brought him to the sea dike at Harlingen, and made him thrust through two men with the sword that he had placed in his hand. Bekker asked: whether he remembered any Hebrew word at all? He said: Yes, one, \"alley,\" which I use when I want to call him. Bekker replied: that is no Hebrew word, and wrote for him on a small coin the words: *Soer nimmenin Satan! Depart from me, Satan!* with the instruction: to ask the devil about the meaning of the words; and instead of the few shillings that he always used to give him, to demand from him a Hungarian double ducat.\n\nHe later reported back: that he had shown the words to the devil, and he had told him that they meant: he should go away from him; but the double ducat he had promised him if he would only first go out; but that he had neither been able nor willing to do. His parents had told Bekker that he sometimes fell into a faint, and then told much about the places where he had been. He asked to be called if it happened again, and now found him once lying flat on the ground, rolling about on it; holding his eyes now closed, now stiffly open; his body mostly drawn together, and in violent motion. After that he came to himself again, and began to speak weakly, but gave little account, except that he was better; though later on he knew how to tell much again.\n\nOnce around the summer solstice, when his brother awoke early in the morning, he saw him lying next to him in bed; with closed eyes in sleep, making all the movements of the mouth, the hands, and the body like one who greedily eats and drinks there. He named now the name of Serug, now of another spirit; and demanded this and that from one or the other tree. He then acted like one who receives something and bites into it; he praised the same and laughed, as if it tasted good to him. Finally, when he received something that did not taste good to him, he scolded his spirit vehemently, something like with the words: Now you deceive me again, and give me what you well know that I do not want at all! With that he drew back, and struck with the flat of his hand so forcefully that a mark of it could be seen on the wall, and from the rebound of it he half awoke. Only when he parted from the meal in the pleasure garden did he clearly make the gesture of taking off the garments that he had received there; and that he had to leave behind, in order to go home in his own clothes. He now got up, really dressed himself, and performed his prayer. The brother then said: You were absent the night, where have you been after all? \\[Page 259\\]\n\nHe denied it at first, and now related, under the seal of confidentiality: that he had been in a most beautiful garden, full of delicious fruits, in good company, and so forth. The brother now sought to make it clear to him from what he had seen that it had only been fantasies; but he could not be persuaded, and instead asserted that the brother had only seen his semblance. Moreover, he must have had great bodily flexibility to wriggle through everywhere. Once Bekter was called into his house, where he found the entire household in consternation. He had gone out onto the street in a moment when the maid had turned her back; and when they searched for him, he met the maid on her return from the baker's, where he had bought and paid for something.\n\nNo one could comprehend how he had gotten out; the doors were locked from the inside, and the courtyard door was barred; he had not been in front, and had not gone through the courtyard, that much they knew. He would say nothing, but finally pointed out two missing bricks in the roof, toward a roof beam; through that the spirit had led him. In the rear building there was a cellar opening under a bedstead, which without bed and straw was covered only with bare planks"}, "Bewitched Daughter in Lyon Vomits Needles and Wooden Pegs, Healed by Saints": {"start_char": 839229, "end_char": 842498, "pages": "261-262", "keywords": ["bewitched daughter in lyon vomits needles and wooden pegs healed by saints"], "verbatim": "\nOne of the oldest facts of this class, of which reports exist, is that which occurred in Lyon. Gaufried, Abbot of Altatuba, reports in the life of the holy Peter Tarantaise---which he, at the command of Pope Lucius, was commissioned by the abbots of C\u00eeteaux and Clairvaux to write: At the castle of Lugdunum there was a pious man who had a daughter bewitched by a woman, suffering from a desperate illness, who could endure neither her husband's presence nor even his sight. Her mother had therefore summoned a known sorcerer to her. He had examined the matter, declared her bewitched, rubbed tree bark, and herbs incantated with words, and administered them to her in a cup; finally, he also gave her a bite in the arm. The woman now partook of her ailment, but from that time on it was as if needles were pressing out from her heart from time to time. She then suffered violent pains, until through the bite in the arm---which did not scar over---needles were driven forth by a secret force. More than thirty of them had thus emerged one after another; when a famous abbot, whom Gaufried, because he was still alive, hesitates to name, passed by on his way, and under the hospitable roof of the father was received, saw the sick woman, and heard her misery recounted by the distressed father.\n\nThe account was immediately confirmed by the evidence of the eyes, as the woman anew felt a needle painfully; in a short time it had advanced to the opening, and soon some blood, then the needle itself, appeared. It was soon pushed further forward, and now a lay brother in the abbot's retinue approached, grasped the protruding one, and drew it out bloody, to preserve it for all time to come as a witness to what had occurred. The abbot betook himself to prayer, and touching the wound, said in the power of faith: henceforth neither iron nor steel shall come forth here. It happened thus, but the matter had only changed, because the power of the sorcery was not yet entirely broken. \\[Page 262\\]\n\nNow there came forth, namely, small wooden splinters or pegs of oak or ash wood, thicker than thorns and a little longer, in place of the needles; however, they were no more of equal length than those had been. Sixteen such had, in the course of a year and fewer months, come from the woman; when finally the holy Peter Tarantusius, to whom this miracle had been reserved, arrived on the scene. The woman was presented to him, as he had ordered the evening before, while he offered the Mass. At that hour the seventeenth peg went from her, which the sacristan drew forth before the eyes of all. The woman went to confession with the saint, received absolution, and after he had administered the Eucharist to her, he bade her be calm; henceforth no matter of any kind would go from her in such a manner. Freed from all enchantment, she lived thereafter with her husband, bore him children; and, as it is said, still alive at the time of this writing, she praises the wondrous power by which she had been deemed worthy to be tried. Peter de Frarineto is called her father, known and honored by all the inhabitants of his place---this is said here; thus ends Gaufried the account, so that if anyone harbors doubt about the event, he may seek conviction from what he is unwil"}, "Nine-Year-Old Child in Utrecht Possessed and Vomits Inedible Objects After Eating Sorrel Leaf from Witch": {"start_char": 842674, "end_char": 845497, "pages": "263", "keywords": ["nineyearold child in utrecht possessed and vomits inedible objects after eating sorrel leaf from witch"], "verbatim": "pretation entirely by the circumstances.

A nine-year-old child had, in May 1625 at Utrecht, taken a sorrel leaf into its mouth, which a woman had offered it, and thereupon felt such pains that it fell down as if dead. Since no medicine helped, it had been exorcised; and now needles, glass, feathers, hairs, nails had burst forth; and it was noticed: as often as that woman approached it within 200 paces, it was each time more severely tormented. She was later arrested and condemned, and with the noose around her neck, confessed herself guilty of the child's harm. This was now brought to Dr.\u00a0Heer in mid-September, and remained with him for some weeks; and he now relates simply and plainly what he observed in it during that time. \\[Page 263\\]\n\nHe had summoned the Father Modestus of Li\u00e8ge. When this one was still 50 paces distant from the room, the child fell down as if dead; no breath could be felt in it, the fingers and toes were so twisted together that I could not separate them with anything. When the Capuchins began to read the exorcism, the child moved with such violence that six persons present could not hold it still; I myself had grasped its head, and felt how it was drawn, through an inner convulsion, with the nape ever against the shoulders. Meanwhile the body swelled up beyond all measure, and at ten paces distant a sound could be heard from it, as when the unruly waves strike against the forepart of a ship; and the child again burst forth from time to time with those objects. I begged the exorcists, out of pity, to pause. They had scarcely spoken the last word when the sufferer lay still; and when they had departed, the hands and feet unclasped; it soon stood up, ate and drank, and played, as if nothing had happened. This repeated itself always; but when I saw that the ejected things were completely dry, I expressed my doubts to those present. The child now cried: Do not doubt that these things come from me! With that it seized my hand and led it into its throat. Feel, it said, a headless pin, which will come forth at once!

In this state she committed various foolish acts, no longer called even her best acquaintances by their names, gnawed with great haste at her own hands as well as at those of others; and wept when one tried to deny it to her. From time to time she would then cry out in the midst of this frenzy: O my God! O, what misery is this! When she came to herself again in lucid intervals, she knew nothing of what she had said and done; and when her siblings made her aware of it, at most a dim recollection of it would dawn on her, and she showed herself extremely dismayed by it. \\[Page 264\\]\n\nThis agitation, whose focal point, as the gnawing reveals, had been in the plexuses of the stomach region, had entered only in the company of a new affliction, which had begun on the same day. For on the aforementioned day, one first noticed in her mouth lumps or pins and other similar things; on which she bit vigorously, and which she gave up again only after long efforts. This phenomenon repeated itself daily in frightful manner two to three times, and continued for eight long weeks until the middle of September. Pins, needles, spirally twisted wires, pieces of glass, horsehairs, nails of all kinds came forth one after another. Most came out of the mouth, following a stabbing pain that she felt in her entrails; whereupon these objects were immediately vomited up amid violent convulsions. The confessor, dismayed by these events, could scarcely bring himself to credit the evidence of his eyes; he therefore reported what had occurred to the parish priest of the place at that time, Mr.\u00a0Eberl. This man had visited her more often earlier; her appearance had never led him to suspect any unusual state that had come over her.\n\nWhen, therefore, the occurrence was reported to him, he must have felt struck by the communication; and, as was natural, he expressed his doubts about the truth of the strange things, and how perhaps some deception might have crept in. When it was replied in the meantime that similar doubts had also arisen earlier with the confessor, but that he had been compelled to yield before the evidence of the facts; he went there to take insight into the event himself. He found the afflicted one in violent convulsions; she threw herself, when the crisis approached, backward over the pillows; and since her mouth stood open thereby, one could easily see deep down into the gullet. The priest now had more than one opportunity to observe how the objects were driven up in it, sometimes placing themselves crosswise, resisting the expulsion; and gradually forced higher and higher up, finally entering the mouth, and then, as if blown out by a wind, being expelled.\n\nInitially fearful, he soon gathered courage at the confessor's urging; and whenever he again caught sight of such objects---needles, nails, or pieces of wood---he reached into the gullet and drew them out deeply, so that any possibility of deception was entirely ruled out. To this day he still preserves many of the things that he thus helped bring to light.\u00b9 Not only through the mouth did these objects leave her, but also through the lower passages; under great pain, the sharp things---as she called them in the local dialect---were expelled from her; and one could hear them, if metallic, clinking as they fell below. In the same way, similar objects emerged externally from her after she had felt the pain in her side or elsewhere, when she straightened up, as if they had forced their way through her skin. \\[Page 265\\]\n\nIn May of that year, a paralysis had set in at her left foot, so that she could not move it. In the following September, finally, a board nail more than three inches long worked its way through the skin of her leg, and the limb immediately regained its former flexibility. The same happened sometimes at the back between the shoulder blades; at other times, however, also at the head, where they opened a way out for themselves. It was remarkable in this that the straight pins did not advance, as would have been the case if they had been introduced from outside, with their heads turned outward; rather, the points were turned outward, so that, since they sat fast and could only be grasped with force, the confessor and others often wounded themselves bloody before they managed to pull them out. All these sharp and injurious objects caused her no bleeding, and left no suppurating wound behind; except when one had injured her through incautious removal of them. But once they were finally removed, the sufferer regained control of herself and felt greatly relieved.\n\nAlong with this phenomenon, there was also another closely related one, that of the strange infestation of the bed. On the bedsheet, under it on the mattress, on the straw tick, needles, straw stems, nails, hairs, pieces of glass, and so forth were found; and scarcely had the bed been cleaned when, sometimes in the presence of the very same persons who had removed the earlier objects, quite similar ones appeared in the same place, and the cleaning had to be repeated. As long as these bed infestations were around her, the sufferer found herself in such agitation and mental confusion that she not infrequently cried out with a distorted face, flashing eyes, and protruding tongue: she wanted to kill herself; she was damned anyway, she wanted to go with the men who were turning her bed topsy-turvy. Immediately afterward she would complain again of painful stinging in the eyes, in the lower body, on the chest; she howled and cried miserably, often tore out whole handfuls of hair, and wanted to jump violently from the bed out the window. It is noteworthy that the maids who made the bed never found the mentioned infestations; except when the confessor was present in the room. He had, as was natural, taken all precautions, as far as it was at all feasible, to keep such objects---as are usually found in the sweepings---away from her. All the women who approached her had been instructed to pay close attention to needles and whatever similar things they carried on them. But all caution proved useless; the things gathered around her, as if drawn to her. One day, as they were just cleaning the bed again, Marie suddenly began to tremble and called out quivering: Oh! Oh! The confessor asked: what was the matter?\n\nOh, she replied, now something ugly and large is coming and wants to get into my bed. In fact, one heard how something from the next room, continually striking against the floor, clattered through the open door toward the bed standing close by it. The confessor commanded: Seize it in the name of Jesus, and hand it here! Oh, she cried, it is already running away again, and now it is going into the next room! One of the girls present had the courage to follow it there and pick it up; and there it was found to be a piece of hard wood that had been wrapped with human hair, alternately striking the floor with one end and the other, thus coming along. \\[Page 266\\]\n\nThe confessor, dismayed by all these occurrences, inquired in many ways: how it could be that these strange objects came to her in this manner, and even pressed into her body; but she could give no definite information about it. She said: sometimes it seemed to her as if they entered through the eyes, sometimes again through the mouth; it also seemed to her at times as if they were thrown up against her breast and throat by a little man. Only this one thing was certain, and she maintained the same for a long time afterward: that each time abominable men of dark form surrounded her, and offered and presented to her shapes of various enjoyable objects and delicacies, chestnuts, pastries, and confections. Then she lusted after what was offered, and it was immediately forced upon her by the men; whereupon always violent stabbing and cutting pains would set in, until all that stuff was removed from the body again.\n\nThe whole matter had been sought to be concealed as much as possible on account of the sensation; but it came out nevertheless, at least in part, and the strangeness that lay in the entire occurrence made people suspicious; they suspected witchcraft and evil arts, and many who had previously wished well to the afflicted one withdrew from her. Therefore the confessor said to her one day: You see, Marie! how all these hideous things lead people astray; therefore turn yourself in fervent prayer to God, that he may take the plague from you. She promised to do as he had said; and then after some time, when she had gone to holy communion around the middle of September, she said: The Lord has said: I am to have the general prayer held for me in a church, then the torments will cease. But to you I am to vow strict obedience in all things; then you can forbid, in the future, accepting anything from the abominable men, and I shall remain freed. Both happened with the foretold success.\n\nThe plague was meanwhile not entirely at an end all at once. For a long time Marie still lamented that the dark men still stood at her bed, and wanted to give her abominable things to put her to death. Once also, when through convulsions her mouth was forced open, three needles were thrown at once into the open throat in the presence of t"}, "Gertrud Fischer in Frankfurt Possessed, Grabs and Swallows Money and Needles, Speaks New Language": {"start_char": 859489, "end_char": 866771, "pages": "268-270", "keywords": ["gertrud fischer in frankfurt possessed grabs and swallows money and needles speaks new language"], "verbatim": " death; so in another form an affect more akin to the metal, namely greed and avarice. Very significant from this side is what took place with Gertrud Fischer in Frankfurt on the Oder during the time of the Reformation. \\[Page 268\\]\n\nThe daughter of a man named Martini Fischer from Lebus; she had become weak in the head while with him, as the preacher Andreas Ebert of Frankfurt first made known in an open letter, whereupon a citizen of that city, Georg von Kulisch, took her in and had her cared for according to her needs for a long time, during which she became partly healthy again. But this recovery of hers soon changed again afterward, and her ailment grew worse and worse the longer it lasted; so that she became possessed by the enemy of truth, and began to do all manner of things.\n\nAmong other things, the preacher says, it happened thus: whenever the aforementioned maid grabbed hold of someone by the coat, sleeve, beard, or otherwise, she always seized money current and valid in this land; and she would quickly carry it to her mouth, chew it, and finally swallow it down, unless the people took it away from her beforehand; and likewise much of this still remains among the citizens here. But after such things had happened from her many times, it was reported to the honorable council, which had her taken into safe custody and care. But what wonders she performed would well deserve a special book to be written about them. She also seized 405 needles, which she chewed and also swallowed. In addition, she spoke good Upper German, which had previously been unknown to her; for she could speak nothing but her mother tongue, namely Markish, and even now can speak no differently. Therefore I was moved, as a preacher in that place at the time, to write to the reverend and highly learned Herr Doctor Martin Luther, according to this enclosed copy, and to ask him to share with me his counsel and good judgment in this matter. To which he replied to me: that it was a strange, unheard-of thing to him, if it were so; and therefore he requested that I write to him in my own hand the truth of it, whether it was indeed real money.\n\nThis I wrote back to him, that it was in no way otherwise. Thereupon he gave his recognition and shared with us his advice: that one should lead the maid into the sermon, and pray to God for her; so would it in time become better with her. In the meantime, she had been exorcised by a papist priest, in the hope of driving the devil out of her; over which she made much mockery, and scorned all such things. But when she was led into the sermon, the devil through her often accused me of lies during the preaching; and when I commanded him to be silent, she was silent, and thus she was helped through the common prayer; and I now know not what has happened to her, and what she has done, for to this day she is here a fresh and healthy serving maid. Which all is known and manifest not only in Frankfurt, but also in the whole Mark and many other places.\n\nSomewhat later the following document appeared concerning her and her doings: Before all men in general and each one in particular, of whatever rank, estate, or condition they may be, who shall see, hear, or read this our public attestation, we, the judges and aldermen of the city of Frankfurt on the Oder, do hereby make known, by means of our friendly service in advance, that the worshipful Herr Erasmus Alberus, preacher at K\u00fcstrin, has earnestly requested of us, and sought from us a true testimony concerning the wondrous event which occurred here in Frankfurt about a year and a half ago with a maid, who by chance seized money with her hand and swallowed it, etc., as it pertains thereto. \\[Page 269\\]\n\nWe, the undersigned inhabitants, to attest to the truth and without hesitation in declaring it, provide this testimony: that the aforementioned wondrous event and miracle is here in Frankfurt well known, and publicly evident and widely rumored; that the said maiden, by mere chance, wherever she has touched with her hand---be it upon a coat, beret, doublet, hand, sleeve, head, beard, or upon a table, bench, wood, stone, earth, wall, or the like---has grasped therewith money in her hand, brought it to her mouth, and bitten into it so that it has cracked between her teeth; and she has let the coin protrude from her mouth, so that it could be clearly seen, and thereafter swallowed it, whereby she has often changed color in her face from a single swallow. Likewise, she has done this at night in bed while lying beside her nurse: from the featherbed, pillow, bedboard, and whatever else she has grasped, she has caught money, rustled with it, and stuffed her mouth full, so that she has horribly choked and gurgled from it, nearly suffocating, such that a light had to be kindled and aid brought to her, leaving her neck immediately bruised and blackened.\n\nPeople have also at first, whenever she has grasped at some object, swiftly seized her hand before she could bring it to her mouth, and by force pried open her hand to take the money from it, whereupon she has screamed horribly. She has also handed over the money from her own self to certain honorable folk, both men and women, after making such a grasp; and at times she has stuffed her entire mouth full of money with her hand, rustled it about in her mouth, and gnashed it with her teeth. And it has been all manner of valid coinage, such as Markish groschen, pfennigs, Stettin, Meissen, Polish, and Bohemian money, as well as Prussian groschen; and among them some bad, reddish coin as well. Otherwise, when questioned, she has spoken strange and wondrous words. All this, as reported above---and much else besides---through grasping at money, she has done to herself.\n\nIn truth, it happened just as described, as many people, including council members, are still present who have the money that they received from her. To confirm the truth of this, I, Theobald D\u00fcrrekragen, the honorable and wise council's appointed and established judge at the court in Frankfurt an der Oder, have knowingly had the court's seal affixed to this letter by the assessors. Given on Saturday after the Nativity of St.\u00a0Anne, 1585.\n\nOne sees that much is still missing for this remarkable appearance to be fully investigated and recorded in all its circumstances. Only one thing must be regarded as firmly established---since one cannot assume that the people were foolish enough to let themselves be deceived by sleight of hand---that is, the money-grabbing and the swallowing of what was grabbed. Georg Sabinus, who in the fourth book of his Latin elegies dedicated a special one to it, has added some decisive circumstances therein. A voice called out to her in her sleep: \"Arise, great riches will be given to you!\" She awakens and sees, not far from her bed, a distinguished man who says to her: \"If you will be my beloved, then you shall enjoy all my treasures that lie hidden in the earth.\" She is said to have replied: \"Whoever you may be, you shall be mine.\" Now the apparition suddenly takes on a different, terrible form; the girl is frightened by it and by the glow of its eyes, and becomes enraged.

The most instructive thing that has occurred in this way is what at the end of the sixteenth century took place in the Upper Palatinate. On 20 November 1694, the twelve-year-old son Theodor of the pastor Z. D\u00f6derlin there, at the church of Berolzheim near Weissenburg am Sand, had begun to complain of headache and stomach ache, with complete loss of appetite; but the mother, who believed he had perhaps eaten something harmful while playing in the garden, had given him a home remedy, which however on the following day had only produced vomiting and stool, with the expulsion of some worms.\n\nIt took another six days of all sorts of remedies to still the vomiting; but since fainting fits, heart palpitations, and epileptic convulsions followed, they called in the physician from Weissenburg, Dr.\u00a0Wider, for counsel; who advised on worms, and prescribed helminthogogic remedies, mixed with stomach-strengthening and anti-epileptic ones. These too were applied fruitlessly for a whole month, and the symptoms of the illness multiplied; they therefore discontinued the medicines, and resorted only to a bloodletting, after which the patient's strength increased somewhat, and only the vomiting persisted. Wider therefore prescribed, on the 5th of January 1695, pills against it once more, as well as against the worms; whereupon the boy for the first time began to feel a large worm in his intestines, and on the 2nd became so deranged that it seemed his end was at hand. But when he came to himself again, he filled the house with weeping and lamenting, threw himself from the bed onto a bench, and rolled about on it, continually crying out that the worm would kill him with its bites. They gave him all manner of things, especially garlic juice, after which the worm ceased biting, and the boy stopped his wailing. The doctor prescribed what was fitting, but the worm proceeded once more to bite, now on the right side, now on the left; and the boy rolled about screaming again, and the pain nearly drove him to madness. \\[Page 273\\]\n\nThis continued for so long, until someone advised soothing the creature with milk; it then indeed desisted from biting, but was by no means thereby expelled. They immediately administered suitable medicines, of which, however, only the Marrubium album drove a millipede out through the stool. Since the tartar emetic weakened the boy immensely, he was conveyed under medical care to Weissenburg, where quicksilver and the decoction of Hypericum procured him three days of rest; but upon that the worm, ascending as far as the pit of the stomach, began once more to stir most violently. Only by means of milk could it be pacified; with bitter drinks it bit furiously about. Abstinence from food and drink brought on labored breathing, swelling of the face, and choking fits. They administered such violent purgatives that it seemed either the boy or the worm must succumb to them; all to no avail. They were therefore obliged to resolve on sending him back again to his parents. In the meantime, someone had made the proposal to the despairing ones, to assist the patient against the worm with warm cloths, and this proved effective: they could drive it or lure it backwards or forwards with them; it came sometimes as far as the gullet, and had to be repelled with vinegar.\n\nFrom that time onward the boy could retain the foods that pleased the creature; the others, however, it cast back from the gullet. They obtained the judgment of the medical faculty at Altdorf; who, since medicines would not avail, proposed a dissection to be performed by a skilled hand; and since this did not seem agreeable, the most renowned physicians in Nuremberg, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Oettingen, and Switzerland were consulted, but their counsel remained wholly without effect. Full three hundred times a day the worm ascended into the throat; the belly meanwhile swelled enormously from sundry creatures, which from time to time could be felt externally; but these always remained below, while that one alone mounted upward. They placed the boy on his head, and had him inhale the vapor of milk. The worm, following after the milk, came up so far that it became visible to those standing by, but could nevertheless never be drawn forth; only another millipede was expelled. Only before the Marrubium album did the creature show aversion; its decoction always drove it from the stomach into the intestines, under great pains to the boy; which pains endured until it had reached the lowest bowels. But when it was just on the point of being expelled from there, it suddenly mounted back up to the stomach, and celebrated its happy return with some merry leaps. \\[Page 274\\]\n\nIt was equally sensitive to heat; a burning wax candle, the flame from the stove, the rubbing with warm cloths drove it to flight; and it immediately rolled itself into a lump, in which one could feel a movement like that of vipers. If one brought an even hotter cloth near, it fled to another corner. When the abdomen swelled, which happened several times daily, then the strongest man could not press it down; but as soon as someone pressed the head of the worm with a finger, the others, all of them smaller, fled to another place. Rue was so hateful to them that, if the boy smelled it, ate it, or laid it on the abdomen, they were all thrown into great rage and agitation. They likewise abhorred radish, vinegar, and everything bitter; but the sweet was exceedingly pleasant to them, and the scent of a musk ball made the larger worm leap up perhaps a hundred times in a quarter of an hour. From then on, however, he abated somewhat in his wildness; for although he climbed up into the throat more than a thousand times every day, and each time had to be removed by swallowing, whereby the noise he made could be heard a hundred paces away; yet he bit only when provoked to anger, and then only lightly.\n\nNow one of those folk healers appeared, of the kind that the faculty is wont to call medicaster, who advised removing the bitter, but recommended sweet and fatty things. His advice was followed, and whether it was due to the application of these remedies or to chance, from March 4 to 26 the following creatures emerged from the boy's mouth and anus, to the astonishment of all witnesses. Namely: 162 larger and smaller centipedes, ten or twenty at a time; two moths; a white worm with a black head, while a similar one bored into the navel; four fast-running worms, each with twenty stinger-bearing feet; four hopping butterflies; four other swiftly moving red maggots resembling large ants; a white centipede; 42 dark-colored caterpillars of various sizes; finally, a full-grown beetle. Not all emerged through the mouth, but some crawled along the palate to the ethmoid bone, and were then driven out through the nose with a warm cloth. They were all very lively and so nimble that, if one did not catch them immediately, they soon ran away. They did not come mixed together, but the like kinds appeared together; the smaller insects were surrounded by the four larger ones, and by some smaller earthworms, as if by a dam; and some of them lived 3, 8, up to 12 days, until they finally starved to death.\n\nThe parents joyfully considered the boy already freed; but on March 26 an interlude occurred that led them to conclude it was sorcery. As the other children were playing in the garden on March 26, they found in a new bird's nest a white bird's egg painted with red figures; but when they opened it to eat, the yolk was black and sprinkled as if with gunpowder. For this reason they threw it against the fence and washed their hands; but as the parents and neighbors now came running up because of the novelty of the thing, suddenly a rooster fell down dead; two hens, however, were seized with convulsions, and on the following day the crossroads in the garden was found sprinkled with a black powder. That incompetent doctor now had the boy's abdomen covered with plasters, gave him all sorts of things unceasingly, and had the belly bound and pressed upward. Now, from that day until the end of May, four frogs of medium size were driven out from the boy's mouth, by applying stinking things from below but sweet ones from above; one of which had a beetle, a mealworm, and a frog in its stomach, the second slime, but the other two nothing in their stomachs. When the first one had been expelled, some friends advised: to bring the boy at night to the fish pond, where there were many frogs; in the hope that, if he still had more inside him, these might perhaps be lured out by sympathy with those in the pond. \\[Page 275\\]\n\nScarcely had he, however, come near the pond, when his belly swelled beyond measure. The worm, which for several weeks had not bitten, now began again its old cruel game, and rose up in the following days perhaps a thousand times; but the frogs in the boy's body answered those outside with the same croaking and the same motion; so that, on account of the uproar in his body, the boy from then on never again dared to go out at the time when the frogs croaked. After the expulsion of the frogs followed some toads, then 21 lizards of various sizes; the frogs as well as the toads were lively in color, and of different kinds. The larger span-long toad killed the smaller one at once with her breath, and filled perhaps a glass with her slime, which she then swallowed up again. Before the separation of all these animals went a feverish chill, followed by a tickling in the throat. Then the animals were vomited up lengthwise, without particular pain.\n\nThe last lizard was covered with a piece of skin from another dead one. It was now believed that the great worm too had in some way departed. But when the boy, after his daily prayer, went to bed again, which he had shunned for two days out of fear, and now fell asleep easily; he suddenly raised himself up, and cried: something bitter had flowed into his throat, from which his lower belly was swelling; at the same time the worm began to rage again. Since the insect nest was now destroyed, it ran up and down freely and as if in a fury, and bit most violently at the slightest movement of the boy. Whether it had been vomited up and returned, or had remained, had to remain undecided.\n\nBut when on the 9th of June friends who visited the boy brought him confections, the creature was thereby lured several times into his throat; and caused him such distress that he lay down on a cushion of the bench by the window in the sun; and there, holding a piece of confection in his hand, he became a little beside himself. The creature, lured by the sweetness, now sprang forth; to those present it seemed a viper, and the boy's body fell together at once. The housemates searched most eagerly for the viper in all corners for a whole hour, but could not find it. So that it might not slip into the boy's mouth again, it was resolved to convey him over to the house of a trusted neighbor; where he remained for eight days sound and cheerful. Meanwhile, some remedies were provided to the boy by a respectable person, which were supposed to be particularly salutary against sorcery: a water, a powder for fumigating, another with an oil to rinse the mouth, and an amulet. At the same time the remedies of the unqualified doctor were continued, and now the boy vomited up, from the 17th to the 21st of June, some shoe nails, half of a chain ring, seven pieces of bowls, stones among which two quite large ones, a ball of hair, pieces of white and red eggshells, two forks one of which was wound around with hair, a piece of a medicine glass, finally two large nails.\n\nAt all these things, as at the departure of the animals, were present the collector Knebel, the pastor of Trommetsheim, and many other most credible people. All the objects came singly, under sometimes hours-long exertions; which at the forks were so great that they produced an exceedingly strong hoarseness. The boy now felt nothing more, and the parents resolved to take him home again; but they placed him in another room, and he slept with a relative who watched over him the whole night until six o'clock in the morning. \\[Page 276\\]\n\nShortly after she had fallen asleep, the viper returned, however, to the horror of all. Since they applied triple doses of the medicine and manifold prayers, she soon departed again in that light ecstasy which overtakes the severely exhausted; after she had previously bitten his foot, so that he came to from it, and ran screaming into the father's study, showing the swollen foot and calling for help. Some theriac and the anointing with scorpion oil soon restored him, so that his parents took him to church on Sunday. But as he was on the stairs, from the lower story to the upper, the viper pursued him again; so that he hurriedly slammed the door of the upper hallway behind him and cried for help. Trembling as he was, he therefore could not be let out of sight the entire day; during which he then, in the evening, expelled one of the forks from himself. He spent the night in the house of C. Bambrucker, under the watch of his grandmother and constant prayer, peacefully. But early in the morning at 6 o'clock, he felt the viper in his body again, and one could plainly hear it hissing.\n\nHe was therefore brought home once more; the grandmother, who constantly remained at his bedside, did not take her eyes off him, in case she might see the creature at its exit. In vain, however---as soon as sleep and that kind of ecstasy came over the boy, it had gone out for the fourth time, and bit him so fiercely in the hand that the blood began to flow from it. The parents now sent the boy, under the care of his grandmother, to Weissenburg, and there he continued the use of the medicines under good care. He still vomited some smaller frogs, and three pieces of a smaller viper, such as the son of the apothecary H\u00f6chstetter had found him lying on the ground and picked up; but now, after some tufts of hair had passed from him in Rotenburg in July 1695, he became completely healthy in body and soul, and at the time of the report's composition lived at the Gymnasium in Heilbronn, devoted to his studies.\n\nIn this story, palpable bestiality and mystical superstition border so closely upon one another in an animal fable that a rational age could neither withhold nor grant belief, and thus strove most eagerly to dispose of the whole matter as quickly as possible through forgetting, in which it succeeded quite well. Since we cannot do the many sensible people who had dealings with the story the indignity of believing that they let themselves be fooled for longer than six months by a cunning boy; we must therefore look elsewhere to connect the event with other things heard, and thereby make it somewhat comprehensible to ourselves. \\[Page 277\\]\n\nOn the occasion of the viper, we learn that the boy, in all the acts where it actively intervenes and seems to come and go, was in a kind of ecstatic sleep. We must assume that this was already an innate disposition in him, and that the entry of all the animals that made their home in him had already occurred in a seizure of this ecstasy. In the garden or nearby there was a fish pond, in and around which all these animals were to be found; the boy had played near it the day before the outbreak of the affliction, and had likely fallen into that sleep-waking state at its edge. All those rapports that sleep even in life itself had now awakened in him, and begun their play. Just as the underground metals enter the circle of the rhodomancer, the movements of the stars into the sphere of the star-sick, the dead into that of the vampirically afflicted; so it was here with the animals, within the sphere of action of these instincts: they were not merely perceived, but felt their pull on their own side as well, and yielded to it. This showed itself still, after the counter-act of the intake, in the act of their expulsion.\n\nAll the animals, namely, as soon as they had come to light through vomiting, ran about with great agility; fleeing every other human being except the boy, toward whom they felt a secret sympathy; and he could lure them wherever he wished, touch them if he pleased, and, to preserve them, lock them up in a vessel, in which they lived for a time nourished with milk, but then, when sprinkled with horse urine, died. Drawn by this secret sympathy, the animals at that time---whether in pairs, or merely fertilized female individuals---had entered through the boy's open mouth, just as all sexes had then entered the saving ark; they had settled in his interior, and in the same instincts gained a right of home in the domain of their lord and king: a right that was first canceled for them only when the sympathy, through the medicines and the reactions of nature, had turned into antipathy. They were now expelled, especially in the reversal of the peristaltic movement; and the sequence in which they had gone out in masses, grouped according to species, shows the sequence in which they had built their nests inside from above downward. \\[Page 278\\]\n\nThe first to have come were the lizards, those nimble, agile creatures that easily slip into any opening; they had therefore settled deepest in the lower entrails, and there multiplied fruitfully. The toads and the frogs had joined them, and taken up residence in the next higher regions of the entrails. These had been followed by the earthworms; a beetle that had remained infertile, and the host of caterpillars had spread through the thin intestines, and two of them had already completed their metamorphosis. Finally, nearest the lower gate of the stomach, the last to arrive---and therefore also the first to be expelled---centipedes had found their lodging. In proportion as the settlers had multiplied, the boy's abdomen had swollen; but the animals themselves in their lightless abode had become equally distended, like the plants that by chance had grown up in the night of the mines. It was observed of all of them that they were of unusual size, and had fat bellies; but if they were dead, they quickly collapsed, and shriveled away into insignificant remnants. The animal heat had slowly promoted them, but their cold-blooded nature had given them that irritability toward higher degrees of heat. Also remarkable are the other observations made on this occasion concerning their household: their aversion to horehound, rue, beet, St.\u00a0John's wort, all things bitter and sour; their love for milk and all things sweet, and for the pleasant scent of musk; remarkable too that, hearing through all the belly coverings, they had been collectively excited by the frogs in the pond, and even the enclosed ones had begun to cry out.\n\nThe innate head of the animal sabbath, which the boy had abidingly assembled in his entrails, was that viper who had pitched her court in the stomach, from there ruled the upper parts, and, when she wished, stretched her snakelike body through the realms and nests of the lower animals. Her dominion showed itself when her head was roughly touched; at which all the animals took flight before her wrath and the convulsive movements of her body. One might doubt her existence, and believe that she owed her being only to the ecstatic vision of the intestine filled with that parasitic life, which would now have to project itself snakelike into the inner sense; had she not been felt all too clearly at that time, upon the application of heat, in that tangle, and otherwise; and had not actual parts belonging to a snakelike body been later discharged.\n\nHowever, there was always a connection between her and the ecstatic state of the boy, which confused in her the realms of the tangible and the visionary, and particularly made uncertain the reports concerning her exit and entrance. For she was never seen and found by anyone with clarity, although she was sought everywhere with the utmost care; for which reason a doubt was also entertained regarding her actual existence, since she never appeared without a slight state of being beside himself "}, "Widow in Bergamo Afflicted by Demonic Voices Suggesting Intercourse": {"start_char": 908730, "end_char": 909724, "pages": "282-283", "keywords": ["reasons for failed demonic intercourse", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": " and cannot be imputed in the absence of the will's assent.\n\nAmong the numerous facts that present themselves, we shall select only those that either lie at the transition into the demonic character, or appear fully expressed in it.

He himself knew very well that it was not his Theresa, but some house-demon; nevertheless, after some words and embraces, he took it into his bed. After that the form said to him: she was not the girl, but a demon who loved him, and therefore joined herself to him day and night.

Just as clearly does this agreement reveal itself through external signs and the boldness of the behavior. In the year 1649, Brognoli recounts, I was to exorcise a possessed woman on the order of the Apostolic Nuncio; she visited me the following day at the door of the monastery of St.\u00a0Bonaventure, dressed in the habit of a Tertiary of St.\u00a0Francis, but very vainly adorned, quite beautiful and about 35 years old. When I asked her: What sort of torment the demon was inflicting upon her? she replied: It has been about 18 years since he, in the form of a handsome youth, has abused my body; which happened, as now, so also during the lifetime of my husband, when he would then send a sleep over him and do as he pleased. In the conversations that I have with him, he always drives me to blasphemy; he also often brings me out of the house at night to consort with other sorcerers.\n\nI now began to exorcise her in her house; but soon noticed that she was in complete agreement with the demon. For she brought me a message from his side: if I wished to free the woman from him, I must proceed according to the ancient *Rituale Romanum* and according to the *Flagellum Daemonum* of Menghi. I must first inquire of him the signs of the maleficium, which were laid in a human skull; and moreover procure for myself the fish gall with which the young Tobias drove the demon out of his wife. The intention to trick him with this was all too obvious; he therefore replied: he had no need at all to let himself be instructed by the devil on how to drive him out of believing and God-fearing men and women. She should therefore tell him: he, being a spirit and easily traversing all seas, should search out that fish in them and bring it to the fish market in Venice for sale. I would then, if it seemed right and fitting to me, take the liver and do with it what seemed appropriate according to Catholic custom.\n\nThe cunning woman fell silent with a smile and only begged me to visit her again when she summoned me; and I left her with good admonitions to repentance and to the use of spiritual means to free herself from the power to which she belonged body and soul. Since she in the meantime had me summoned a second time to the house of a painter where she lived, the painter's maid, a pious and God-fearing woman, warned me against her: she was a sorceress who went out of the house half-naked and nude.

The author of the *Specimens of British Prose Writers*, Barnett, relates an example of this from his own experience. Fifty years ago there lived in a village of Somersetshire an old woman who was generally regarded as a hag. Her body was dry, bent by age she went about on crutches. Her voice was hollow, of a mysterious but hypocritical solemnity; from her eyes went forth a piercing, stinging light that struck the one who looked at her with silent terror. \\[Page 286\\]\n\nSuddenly a young, healthy man of 21--22 years from the same place was haunted by the Alp; so persistently and frequently that his health was attacked by it, and within 3--4 months he was weak, pale, emaciated, bearing all the signs of a life drawing to its end. Neither he nor any of his family had any doubt about the cause; and as he was resolved, he decided to wait for the hag while awake. For a long time he did not succeed in this; finally his resolution prevailed, and he now heard at midnight a soft, cautious step on the stairs. She came to the foot of the bed, climbed onto it, and then pressed herself slowly up along his feet. He let it happen until she had come to his knees and wanted to throw herself upon him with her full weight.\n\nNow he seized her with both hands by the hair and held her fast with convulsive strength, while at the same time calling out to his mother, who was sleeping in the nearby room, that she should bring a light. While she ran for the light, the two of them struggled with each other in fury on the floor, for so long until, with the first glimmer from the stairs, the woman tore herself from his fists with supernatural force and vanished from his eyes like a flash of lightning. His mother found him standing there, still breathless from the exertion, holding both hands full of hair. When he, says Barnelt, recounted the incident to me, I asked him curiously where he had put the hair. He replied: It was clumsy of me that I did not keep it; that would have proven the identity of the person best. But in the storm of my emotions, I let it fall to the ground; and she to whom it belonged took care that it never came before my eyes again. But on that occasion I covered it over in such a way that she has not returned since to plague me. It is strange, he added, that while I seized her and wrestled with her, although I was certain that it must be she, yet her breath and her entire being seemed like that of a blooming young girl. The man to whom this happened still lives; he told me the story more than once; I can therefore vouch for the truth of the effect, whatever one may think of the cause.\n\nThis cause one can seek first in a vision of the agent himself, without great danger of erring, which went forth as a critical one into that struggle, which yielded with the first glimmer of light and let the one who had returned to consciousness glimpse the hair in the intermediate moments, which then vanished later on. But whether this vision was a merely one-sided one, proceeding from him, or whether the woman took part in it, cannot be determined from the circumstances"}, "Nun Confesses Incubus to Thomas of Brabant; Christine Attempts to Take It, Suffers Torment": {"start_char": 922453, "end_char": 924425, "pages": "287-288", "keywords": ["nun confesses incubus to thomas of brabant christine attempts to take it suffers torment"], "verbatim": "\nIf there is consent and thus the cooperation of the will in the matter, then the evil is very hard to heal.

She now became earnestly repentant and confessed continually amid many tears; but there was now nothing to be devised that could free her from her incubus: neither the sign of the cross, consecrations and blessings, nor even the altar sacrament itself, which terrifies the angels, would bring her help. The evil now seemed to persist in her as a punishment and only vanished after many years and much prayer. In its course, she once complained, on the eve of Pentecost, in 's-Hertogenbosch to a pious sister, Christine, of her misfortune, which took away her courage to go to communion.\n\nChristine now said to her: Lie down calmly and go tomorrow to the Lord's table! For I will take your evil upon myself. She now went away joyfully, slept in peace, and rose in the morning and hastened to the sacrament.

In the year 1645, in the Bergomese territory, there was a youth of about 25 years, so attacked by a maleficium that he could neither eat, drink, nor perform other natural functions, indeed could scarcely breathe or speak. He came to Brognoli, who blessed him; and since the demonic revealed itself through various movements and exertions, he subdued it by means of ecclesiastical regulations. He now advised the youth to go to confession and communion, and then to seek out in Brescia a famous exorcist, because he himself at that time did not yet engage in exorcism. But this youth, once he recognized himself as possessed, cast the suspicion that he had caused the same upon an old woman, whose malice toward him he well knew. \\[Page 288\\]\n\nUpon returning home, he therefore said to his friends and household companions: that he had been so ill-treated by the woman; he knew that she had done the same to others as well, and he therefore wanted to report her to the Inquisition. In the meantime, he had asked the superior of the monastery in his place to take him in for that night with a friend who was devoted to him. This was granted to him, but after the fourth hour of the night, while he was fully awake in the room, with the window and door standing open, he saw that woman come into the room, climb onto the bed, and seize him by the throat with her hands, so that he was nearly strangled. He sought to hold her off from himself with all his might, reviling her with many abusive words; and so great was the force that he exerted in the process that his bedstead was broken by it; all of which his companion heard, without, however, seeing anyone.\n\nAnd it did not stop at one time; after half an hour, the apparition attacked him in the other bed, where he lay with his friend, and sought to drag him out of it. But the companion held him back, embracing him, sensing a great force and much exertion against his struggling, but otherwise still seeing no one. The result was that the head and neck of the unfortunate one swelled up so much that he was entirely disfigured by it, and behaved like a madman; foaming at the mouth, gnashing his teeth, striking himself against the floor, and intent upon hurling himself down from it. In the morning, he told me everything, in the presence of many witnesses; with a rough and broken voice, he complained about the old woman, and added: \"The woman torments me, and will not stop until she has killed me.\" And that came to pass around the ninth hour of the same day, when he died.\n\nIt was said to have been observed that that old woman had not been in the church that morning in her usual manner; she was not seen until the evening after the death of the wretch. The suspicion also seemed confirmed by the death of her niece, who died within less than a month of an unusual illness; a death that was attributed to a maleficium, because she had loved that youth passionately, and now, grieving over his death, had recounted that it had happened through a bite that the old woman had offered him.

II. No.\u00a0505. p.\u00a0163. 437 and had performed great penances for this liberation. I now instructed her in all acts of faith and trust, advised her to attack the incubus with all kinds of curses, mockery, and derision, and then blessed the room and the bed. I then commanded that in this room, with a lamp burning, in another bed, two other nuns of the same congregation, venerable and mature through their age, should lie down there undaunted and with fresh courage, in such a way that, while one slept, the other knelt watching at the bed and continually observed the one plagued by the demon, whether she showed any movement in her face, around her mouth, or on the rest of her body. If she noticed anything like that, she was to immediately wake the other and command the demon in the name of the Lord to depart from there, and to pull the one plagued by him out of the bed. All together were then to kneel, pray the psalm Miserere, give themselves the discipline, and after that recite the Litany of the Holy Virgin.\n\nBefore midnight of the first watch, the incubus came and began, invisible to the one watching, to press upon the sleeping one; she in turn made some movement with her mouth and face and gave a thin, lamenting sound. The one watching woke her companion; both together now fearlessly seized the sleeping one to pull her out of the bed. But the demon held her back strongly; they pulled harder but could by no means overcome the power of the demon. Finally, the command that I had advised came to one of them; and she commanded the demon in the name of Jesus to depart from there! He now fled, and the three immediately carried out what I had assigned to them. On the following day, when I visited the convent and heard what had happened, I encouraged them to continue fighting bravely against the demon, blessed the room again, and commanded the demon never to dare approach her again. Now, although he showed himself in the following night and even ventured to enter through the door, he did not go as far as the bed.\n\nThe afflicted one saw him indeed in the form of the clergyman whom she loved; but she drove him easily to flight by invoking the name of Jesus. On my part, I repeated my advice on the following day, as before. In the third night, the apparition indeed returned, but invisibly, and only causing some slight noise in the chamber; then he completely left the afflicted one, and she was completely freed with God's help. That was without doubt the most rational manner of treatment. The nun had directed her entire intention toward the object of her love, and he appeared to her as a spiritual vampire. \\[Page 290\\]\n\nIn the moment of the attack, she was pressed upon; the heaviness that she felt, she also exerted outward, and the other nuns perceived this heaviness when they tried to pull the sick one out of the bed.

Suerz now pressed all the more eagerly that she go to the father, with whom he had previously spoken, and she finally consented. He received her kindly; but she was at first somewhat abashed, and said nothing. The father then said: I have heard much of your rare virtues; I hope through you to gain closer knowledge of them for my own good. But she answered: I am a sinner; and to that he: That comes surely only from your humility; I hope you will not hide your graces from me. They are rare, these graces, on account of my sinfulness, said she; and he again: Your ecstasies and illuminations, the seeing through of spirits, the foresight, all that is well known to me; God does not grant such things to wicked people.\n\nShe now came two or three times out of herself before the father; he fell upon his knees and besought God for his help, and then he said to her: O blessed one, you who are so closely united with God, and enjoy his sacred embraces! She rejoined: In that you speak truly! So he spoke back and forth, and plainly recognized that she was exceedingly vain, thought greatly of herself, and had a mighty desire for praise and honor. He said to her now: It seems to me in all this that your humility yet deserves a higher reward; and it appears fitting to me that the body also should share in the enjoyment, as is the case with bride and bridegroom. By these words she was, as it were, transported out of herself, and said: You speak the truth, my father! and no one has yet spoken so aptly therein as you. The father then asked whether God was visible to her, how often and under what form he united himself with her.\n\nShe took pleasure in these questions, and said: she did not see her God, but felt him very well; she rejoiced for full two to three hours in his embraces, and gave things to understand that cannot well be repeated. The father said in response: It sometimes dreams to me that I come into company with many people; do you also have such dreams? She answered: Indeed! and when asked: what then the people did together? she replied: They worship God, eat and drink, and are in good spirits for two to four hours. She now went away very pleased, and promised to come again soon. At home she immediately recounted: such as this she had found none before; she would never have another confessor, he had approved everything about her. Believe me, she added, he will yet learn much from me that is not in his books! for the father is actually a simple man, of no great intellectual gifts, who would easily be deceived. Thereafter she went to him more often, and soon let herself out openly against him: that she believed in another God than the God of the Christians, and in another Virgin. \\[Page 293\\]\n\nShe lived with him as man and wife, she had already told the landlady, and confided to the landlord: that she had already been in this state of grace for ten years. When he expressed that he too wished to enter among these elect, she made revelations to him that would have determined him to expel her from the house, had not the father begged him to have patience with her for a while longer. She now advanced further, and said to the landlord, who complained of inner unrest and uncertainty on the new path: since he had begun so happily, she would not conceal from him that above all he must renounce baptism and the Christian Trinity, pride, vanity, and discord. For among them there existed an entirely different Trinity, which the father did not yet know; and when she had declared herself for this one in her night of birth, the angels of the Lord had appeared to her.\n\nShe also confessed that she was marked; she recounted how she spent the nights sleepless, lingering five, six, seven hours in the work of love with her God. Other joys, in comparison with these, were utterly void, because the powers of God were inexhaustible, and his might penetrated to the heart. On the eve of All Saints' Day she said impatiently to her landlords: Had you done in time as I have taught you; then we would be merry together tonight, on one of the principal feasts of the year. She went to bed early in the evening, and when the niece of the house, who slept with her, said in the morning: You said that you had to go to the feast tonight, and yet you did not leave your bed; she replied: You are still too young to comprehend how that can happen.\n\nShe often recounted how things went at the banquets, and spoke of three orders: the first sought only enjoyment and union with God, of whom there were 36, mostly poor and powerless women; the second desired knowledge, insight, and understanding; the third riches, dignities, honors, goods, and these were mostly esteemed people who dreamed only of ambition. There was also a virgin there, with the Christ-child on her lap; but this would first reveal itself in its glory after the destruction of Paradise. All were now filled with horror against these abominations and blasphemies; the father too had obtained what he wanted; and when she therefore appeared before him again in the confessional, he uncovered for her the abyss of perdition in which she wandered in her delusion.\n\nShe was at first frightened, and became as if stunned; then she began to weep and to accuse herself of sorcery. But the emotion lasted only a short time, then the old hardness returned, and she departed with the words: The hour of my conversion has not yet come; but you will have no cause to complain of me. At home she said that she must have three or four days to consider. But since they no longer wished to tolerate her in the house, she left it; yet she continued to hold conversations that pointed toward conversion. However, since she feared an accusation, she resolved, on the advice of her friends, to preempt it, and now accused the father: that he had sought to seduce her into sorcery, had made her deny Christ, had allowed himself attacks on her chastity, and had given her consecrated hosts in order to commit abuses with them. Confronted with him before the convent, she at first repeated her accusation; but then she suddenly fell at his feet, confessing that she had spoken untruth, and tha"}, "Nun in Venice 1664 Seduced by Apparition of Angel Fasting as Incubus": {"start_char": 942773, "end_char": 946020, "pages": "294-295", "keywords": ["nun in venice 1664 seduced by apparition of angel fasting as incubus"], "verbatim": "\nAs in this case a grossly demonic nymphomania, in the one who deliberately deceived herself, was elevated to the highest union; so has this evil sometimes spread in the opposite direction, from above downward. As I, Brognoli recounts, was staying in Venice in 1664, the vicar general of a bishop from the mainland came to me to seek counsel regarding the following incident.\n\nIn a convent of nuns there was a nun who was greatly devoted to fasting and abstinence, though according to her own will. Her desire and love were moreover directed toward reading profane books that dealt with the transformations wrought by Circe and other enchantresses, or those performed by the ancient gods, by which they changed men into animals, birds, serpents, and spirits. One night, the form of an exceedingly beautiful youth came to this nun, and as she gazed at him in astonishment, he said to her:\n\n\"Do not fear, my dearest sister! Are you not that nun who loves fasting beyond all measure, and have you not devoted yourself to it with your whole heart? Know then that I am the angel called Fasting, and I come to you to thank you and to meet your love with equal love. Once I was a king's son; but in my youthful years, in which you too now still stand, I greatly loved fasting and devoted myself entirely to it; so my father, seeing this with displeasure, rebuked me harshly for it. But I, disregarding his admonitions, persisted in my will; for which reason he, full of anger, cast me out of the house. But the gods whom I revered, and who disapproved of such banishment, took me in and transformed me into an angel. As they now gave me the name Fasting, they added the privilege that I may assume the form of a youth as you see me, so that I never age. Moreover, I am endowed with such swiftness that in an inconceivably short time I move from one part of the world to another, coming and going invisibly; but to those who love me, I become visible. Since the gods have now indicated to me that you have directed your whole love toward me, I come to you now to offer my thanks, to stay with you, and to serve you in all things according to your pleasure. For this reason I have today completed the great journey; so let me sleep tonight in your little bed, if it pleases you; fear nothing in my company, for I am a friend of chastity and modesty.\"\n\nThe nun, now most delighted by this speech and lured by it, took him into her bed. The first night passed well, and he did not touch her. But on the second, he began, as a sign of gratitude and love, to embrace and kiss her; then he did not cease from her by day or by night, and he admonished her never to reveal the secret to her confessor or to anyone else. He served her most zealously and followed her everywhere through the convent and the garden, like a faithful servant and companion. Finally, in the year 1664, when the time of the Jubilee came, the nun was seized by remorse in her heart and disclosed everything to her confessor, who persuaded her to reveal the matter outside of confession to the vicar general of the diocese, so that he might take the appropriate measures to free her from the evil. \\[Page 295\\]\n\nThis vicar general now came to me to seek counsel in the matter, which I duly"}, "Nuns in Cloister Familiar with Demons, Conversing and Allowing Assaults": {"start_char": 946698, "end_char": 947444, "pages": "295", "keywords": ["- intervals with amnesia in possession"], "verbatim": "e community.\n\nBy the nature of the matter, such diffusion will occur most frequently in nunneries, where the evil itself takes root most easily; and now in close living together, under entirely similar influences, the spread of what has taken hold is promoted by the most similar disposition.

It is easy to interpret such things as erotic, very palpable haunting; but harder then to comprehend the long-standing blindness of all the uninterested parties; without, which of course costs little, declaring an entire cloister a brothel.\n\nThat, moreover, where the matter appears more in the form of obsession, it took its first origin in the same way, is proved by the example of the nuns of Nazareth in Cologne, which the same witness recounts. They had been, says the physician, disturbed for many years by various devilish afflictions; when suddenly in the year 1564 a gruesome spectacle arose among them. They were thrown to the ground, entirely in the manner of the act; during the course of which they always kept their eyes closed, and only opened them afterward with great shame. A young girl of fourteen years, who had been enclosed in the cloister, had given the first occasion for it. She had often experienced these strange apparitions in her bed, and had been discovered by her giggling over them; and although she strove to ward off the haunting with a consecrated stole, it nevertheless returned every night. One had placed a sister in bed with her to help fend off the apparition; but the poor thing was miserably frightened when she heard the noise of the struggle. She was finally completely possessed and wretchedly plagued by convulsions. \\[Page 296\\]\n\nWhen she had her seizure, it seemed as if her vision were impeded; and even when she gave the appearance of being in her right mind, she yet uttered strange and uncertain words that bordered on despair. Several soon followed her lead, and thus the pestilence gained more and more ground; especially when, in their great distress, they resorted to forbidden means. I examined these occurrences as a physician in the cloister on the 2nd of May 1565, in the presence of the noble and sensible gentlemen Constantin von Lyskerken, worthy councilor, and Master Johann Altenan, formerly dean of Cleve. Also present were: Master Johann Echst, excellent doctor of medicine; finally my son Heinrich, likewise doctor of medicine and of philosophy.\n\nI read, on this occasion, terrible letters that the young girl had written to her lover; but none of us all doubted for even a moment that they had been written by the possessed one in her attack. It turned out that the cause of the evil had come from some dissolute young people who, after they had, during ball-playing nearby, arranged a love affair with some nuns, soon thereafter climbed over the walls to enjoy themselves with their beloved ones. The matter had been discovered, and their paths barred; but now the devil, that thousand-cunning artist, poisoned the fancy of the poor things, and conjured up before them the forms of their frien"}, "Youth Suffers Hemorrhage and Near-Death from Philtrum in Beer": {"start_char": 956701, "end_char": 957979, "pages": "297-298", "keywords": ["youth suffers hemorrhage and neardeath from philtrum in beer"], "verbatim": "\nThe physicians have made manifold experiences concerning these consequences, and Heer has one such, which we will here only mention in passing.

The youth had drunk with greed, thereupon slept deeply the whole night; but found himself in the morning assailed by great weariness, so that he could scarcely drag himself home. A hemorrhage, through mouth and anus and urine, in superabundant quantity, occurred; ligatures were not able to staunch it. Only sympathetic means could staunch the blood flow, which however returned upon their abandonment; so that the tears which he wept were blood, and blood secreted itself in the ears. The former means indeed stilled the blood, but the young man became more and more enfeebled; so that at last he was held for dead, and as a corpse, sewn into a cloth, laid aside.\n\nHe came to himself, however, fell into excessive sweat, and finally a thumb-thick crust formed over his entire body, which compelled him to stand for six days and nights on a pole until the rash had dried up, and life, at such a price, had expelled the intruded harmfulness once more"}, "Youth Overcome by Lust from Satyrium Plant in Garden": {"start_char": 957943, "end_char": 958668, "pages": "298", "keywords": ["youth overcome by lust from satyrium plant in garden"], "verbatim": "d the intruded harmfulness once more.\n\nKircher tells: A youth noticed that, whenever he visited a spot in his garden, distinguished equally by its greenery as by the freshness of its shade, he was each time moved by a violent impulse to lust; so that it seemed as if he had been seized by satyriasis.

Another case, reported by Brognoli, gives us insight into the progress of the evil, once it has taken root. In Venice, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a merchant was greatly loved by her father's servant, who, in order to gain possession of her, resorted to a sorcerer, who struck her with the maleficium of love.

In the year 1589, there lived in Genoa a youth, who was otherwise well-formed, who suddenly burned with such fierce love toward a woman that he forgot God, and devoted himself only to this his passion. For three months, secret meetings and love letters were exchanged back and forth, until finally the youth fell ill with a violent sickness. Then it was astonishing, what and how manifold filth he spewed from himself in the presence of many witnesses: women's hair, egg shells, cotton, hair and straight pins, nail clippings and bone fragments, various iron scraps in no small number, all mixed with blood. One of the clerics, a Jesuit, exhorted him: that he should no longer allow himself to be bound by such a pernicious love affair; and finally questioned him, whether he perhaps possessed any belongings or letters from her? He confessed: that he had indeed received letters, but had torn them up.\n\nThe clergyman gave no credence to this assertion, and advised his own people to make search in his cabinets; and if they should find anything relating to the love affair, to take it away.

Her parents had forced her into marriage, but after a few years her husband had died; a physician, Poiret, had now cast a violent passion upon her, and had given her such a philtre. She had felt its effect, but had suppressed it with prayers, tears, and vows. Poiret had now managed to administer a second one to her; various ills had thereupon afflicted her, and her parents had compelled her to send for Poiret; but as she distrusted him, she had dismissed him again. \\[Page 301\\]\n\nThis drove the physician out of his senses with rage; but Elisabeth soon fell into unnatural states. One half of her body showed itself stiffened in frost, and without sensation; while the other was in such violent agitations that, notwithstanding the delicacy of her constitution, four of the strongest persons could scarcely hold her. Now one saw her head (in the sutures of the skull) open itself, then close again to the astonishment of those present; while at another time it swelled up in a monstrous manner. The matter caused a sensation; the physician and his adherents spread about that it was all natural effects; consequences of the patient's cunning and confused imagination. Her bishop therefore had her brought to Nancy; six of the most renowned physicians of the city were called in; they examined the matter thoroughly, and at last gave their unanimous testimony to this effect: among the various symptoms of this illness there were some which could only take their origin in a principle foreign to nature.\n\nThe most insightful clergymen were now consulted by the bishop, and several respected bishops took part when the exorcism was applied. All declared unanimously: the patient was possessed by evil spirits, and only audacity could deny this truth. In fact, she was hurled into the heights with such violence that six persons could scarcely hold her down. She climbed in the trees, from branch to branch, with the ease of the nimblest animals. One saw her, entirely lifted into the air, turning herself about in a wondrous manner.\n\nShe fulfilled everything that was commanded unto her in the Italian, German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues, as we have already heard elsewhere; she read a sealed Latin letter, and pointed out the error of an omitted letter. Countless witnesses were present at all these proceedings. The clamor roundabout grew ever greater, the spirits of the sick testified continually against Poiret; this man at last made preparations for flight, whereupon Heinrich II of Lorraine, otherwise a mild regent, caused him to be arrested, and his trial to be instituted. The greatest caution and circumspection were observed in the matter. Magistrates, whom he had requested from France, joined with the natives to form a tribunal of ninety-four judges.\n\nThe accused found defenders; a doctor of theology wrote a book in his favor; a princess expended great sums for his liberation, and the Infanta of the Netherlands wrote on his account unto the Duke. The woman was not spared: she was accused of a hypocrisy at which the most shrewd wits would come to shame; whereupon her two daughters were also arrested, and she herself shut up on water and bread. All who took her part were slandered. A prince of Lorraine, who was a bishop, was to feed her secretly in his palace with dainties. What she did and said was twisted to the worst sense, she herself overwhelmed with every sort of indignity; her letters were broken open, and men wrote at their pleasure whatsoever they would into them; unknown persons pursued her with loaded pistols, but were disarmed in the decisive moment by a secret terror. In the morning rope ladders were found at her window, and footprints in the sand, and she was poisoned several times; a reward of a thousand pistoles, it was said, had been promised to whoever would kill her. \\[Page 302\\]\n\nShe therefore had to be guarded by watches. The prosecution meanwhile watched over her; the slanderous writings that were spread against her were refuted by the most thorough investigation of every action of her life; the exorcisms that the Duchess had instituted were at last continued at the instigation of the Bishop. The trial proceeded quietly on its course, and after the investigation had reached its goal, the 24 judges unanimously agreed upon the death sentence for Poiret. His friends managed to prevent the execution; the Sovereign ordered a new revision, with the same result; the judgment had to be carried out on April 1, 1622, and he died without showing any sign of remorse. After his death, God willed, for the justification of the judges, that Anna Bouley, the companion in all his crimes, should be arrested in Paris with all her magical documents and brought to Nancy. In the remorse that seized her, she confessed her crimes and gave all testimonies of her sorceries.\n\nThe judges, on their side, not relying on her statement alone, conducted all necessary inquiries; and finally condemned her to death, which was just as edifying as Poiret's had been terrible.

My lecturer, P. Syn. Lupus, author of the Commentary on the reserved cases of Bergamo, and on the Edict of St.\u00a0Ing., told me how he had known three men from Bergamo, followers of the priest Simon, who was notorious throughout Lombardy as a magician, and who had agreed among themselves: to demand from the demon a thousand gold pieces for each, and in addition, for all in common, the enjoyment of a beautiful girl.\n\nAccordingly, they invoked the demon, who appeared to them and promised to perform everything if they would surrender their souls to him. They were, however, first to procure some hairs from the girl and lay them on an altar in the forest, near the girl's house; where they were then to sacrifice them to him with incense and worship him as God. They pledged their souls to the demon and then went to the girl's house to ask her for some of her hairs. She refused for a time; but then pretended to consent and cut some hairs from the cow in the stable, which she handed over to them as her own. Immediately they built the altar, put on mass vestments, lit coals in the censer, and invoked the demon, who soon appeared and laid the thousand gold pieces for each upon the altar. But now the cow suddenly broke out of the stable, rushed into the forest; and attacking the magicians with horns and teeth, and leaping upon them with her legs, wounded one after the other, destroyed the altar, and overturned the candlesticks and everything. The people came running up, found the magicians thus badly beaten, and brought them before the Inquisitor; who had them seized, investigated their cas"}, "Knot-Tying Spells Cause Couple to Scratch and Strike for Years": {"start_char": 974152, "end_char": 974590, "pages": "303", "keywords": ["knottying spells cause couple to scratch and strike for years"], "verbatim": "begetting alone.\n\nThere would also be another kind whereby one loved the other, to be sure, but nothing was forbidden to it in the utmost degree; and another whereby they loved one another most fervently, but when they were to see one another, they would horribly scratch and strike each other.

At twenty years of age he had succeeded his father, and forthwith began a senseless extravagance. He maintained a guard of 200 men on horseback; a chapel of 25--30 persons; choirboys, musicians, chaplains had to follow him, along with a great number of other servants, everywhere on horseback, and for them, as for others, he always kept open table. Rich silver vessels, costly garments of gold brocade belonged to this chapel; a portable organ had to accompany the procession everywhere; his chaplains were called, as at cathedrals, deans, singers, archdeacons, scholasters, and one among them bore the title of bishop. \\[Page 306\\]\n\nThey were clothed in scarlet with ermine, had rich stipends, and he had several times petitioned the Pope for miters for them. At the same time he had mystery plays performed at great expense, or rather mysteries, as they were called then. He soon found those who fostered and encouraged his lusts in every way; besides many of lower rank, especially Gilles de Sill\u00e9 and Roger de Briqueville. To cover his enormous expenditures, he naturally had to squander his estates below their value; and not one would have remained to him had not his relatives taken the matter in hand, procuring a royal prohibition against selling any further possession, and a prohibition from Parliament against anyone purchasing any. In this predicament he sought help from chemistry, which was to provide him the philosophers' stone; adepts soon appeared to him: quicksilver had already been fixed, but the philosophical egg broke before it could be hatched. He now sought help from the one reputed to be the possessor of all hidden treasures.\n\nTrusted agents of this master also came to him; a physician from Poitou drew his circles in the forest; the Black One, as he said, had passed by him in the shape of a leopard; that he had remained silent was due to a fault in his preparations. He wished to return home to investigate more thoroughly; richly rewarded, he departed and did not return. A Florentine, Francesco Prelati, great alchemist and magician, took his place; and made use of a book from the Marshal's library. Later in prison he confessed how he had several times seen the demon in the shape of a young man of twenty years, who called himself Baron; how once he had given him a black powder with the command to carry it to the Marshal; and how on another occasion he had shown him a quantity of gold bars, which afterward proved to be merely a heap of sand and a yellowish earth. The Marshal on his side had made a contract in his own blood, in which he promised to give the demon everything he demanded of him, except his life and his soul.\n\nHe had worshiped him for this purpose, offering him sacrifices, incense, alms, and a feast arranged in his honor; and he sealed all this by immediately offering him, as a token of allegiance, the heart, the hand, the eyes, and the blood of a child. Now an old woman was noticed, who roamed about the country and the heathens, approaching the little children who tended the livestock or ran about begging, and flattering them, while always keeping her face half covered with a heavy cloth. She thus lured them to the castle of Raiz, where they then vanished without a trace. At first it was only peasant children and homeless ones who thus perished; but soon, with growing boldness, the city children too came in turn, even as far as Nantes.\n\nBodin recounts on p.\u00a0249, probably from the records: after the werewolf had in this manner slaughtered eight children for the devil, he at last also promised the ninth, his own, and indeed while still in its mother's womb, to kill it for him as a pleasing sacrifice by opening the same. Yet he did not attain to familiar intercourse with him face to face, and he was wont to say: the Unknown must be a common fellow, that he should shrink from associating with persons of rank. This speech of his, now, the sign of the cross that he perhaps made upon entering the circle; or the prayer that he always spoke, especially his Alma Redemptoris Mater; his attachment to the chapel that surrounded him; the secret resolve that he cherished, to atone in the end by a crusade---these were the reasons that his entourage adduced for why no such relation would come about. \\[Page 307\\]\n\nRaiz meanwhile surrendered himself to the most shameful lusts that the imagination can possibly conceive; and so had the bloodthirst in him united itself with this lust, that the unhappy victims of his brutality acquired a true charm for him only in the moment of their death, and out of grim lust he continued what he had begun in despair. He himself killed his unhappy victims with his own hand; their cries, their rattling, their convulsions delighted him, as he strove to increase and prolong them, and to enjoy this lust all the more closely, he would seat himself upon the dying ones. In the tower of Chantoc\u00e9 a whole barrel full of calcined bones of children was found, whose number was estimated at forty, all of whom this Moloch had burned in his glowing arms. According to his own confession, the number of those whom he had thus sacrificed there and in the castle of Machecoul amounted to a hundred; others were found in the privies of Suze, likewise in Nantes, Vannes; so that the total number was estimated at 150.\n\nThey were all sacrificed to the demons Barron, Orient, Beelzebub, Satan, and Belial, while the office of Easter Day was sung to them. Soon after Easter, when he had anew vowed a journey to the Holy Land, but immediately thereafter in Nantes had again defiled himself with the same abominations; he was at last, on the order of the Duke, together with Prelat and some others, arrested. The accusation was brought by the procurator of the Duke, and the promoter of the Bishop of Nantes; six or seven family fathers, whose children had gone to the Marshal and not returned, were likewise complainants. The trial was conducted in the new tower of Nantes, before the Chancellor of Brittany, the Bishop of the place, and the Inquisitor of the kingdom, Jean Merri, on charges of heresy, sorcery, sodomy, and so forth; but before Peter of l'H\u00f4pital, the President, in regard to all that pertained to his competence. He was at first very bold in confronting these; he said: he would rather be hanged by his neck than give account to the clergy, who were all stained with simony and shameful deeds. He knew the faith as well as they, and he wondered that the President should allow them to meddle in such processes.\n\nHe became, however, soon more pliable, and the censors of the church made him confess a part of his shameful deeds; the fear of torture accomplished the rest. He was confronted with Prelati, and the confessions proved Marshal, under tears and sobs, to him: Farewell, Franz, my friend! We shall never see each other again in this world. I beseech God that He may grant you patience and understanding. Be assured that, if you have good patience and hope in God, we shall see each other again in the great joys of Paradise. Pray to God for me, I shall pray for you! On the following day he confessed in public audience all his crimes, and how he had committed an uncountable multitude of other horrors; but he attributed everything to the bad guidance he had received in his youth, which had known no rule but his will and his pleasure.\n\nOn the 25th of October 1440 his judgment was read to him, he was thereupon handed over to the confessor; a procession was held for him, that God might grant him patience, and he was then delivered to the flames on the Magdalene meadow; yet, on accou"}, "Woman Confesses Stealing and Boiling Unbaptized Children for Ointments": {"start_char": 989726, "end_char": 990378, "pages": "308", "keywords": ["- confessing stealing unbaptized children for ointments"], "verbatim": "\nSimilar horrors have also occurred elsewhere, and especially children have become the victims of such abominations.

The convent in Yssel in the Netherlands, in which Marie von Sains lived, was full of obsessions and maleficia, but no suspicion had fallen on her; for one held her to be a saint without equal, until she, driven by a secret power, declared herself to be a sorceress, and was now arrested by the official of Tournay. But it still took another year and a half until she finally, in the year 1613, made the more detailed confessions about her misdeeds, which first of all ran thus: that all the maleficia of the convent had really been instigated by her. Then she also made confessions about her murders. She confessed: how she had murdered many children, or disemboweled them alive, in order to sacrifice them to the devil. Others she had strangled, the still-beating hearts of still others she had crushed and eaten with her teeth, especially those born of Christian parents. Many of these children, she said, I have secretly strangled in this city and the neighboring places, and then exhumed the buried ones, and carried them to our nocturnal gatherings. To many I have thus given death, or removed them from the way with poison that the demons supplied to me; others I have pulled the hair from, still others I have pierced the heart or the temple with a needle; which were thrown into the fire oven, others drowned, still others roasted on a spit, boiled in pots, thrown into the latrines, laid on burning pyres, thrown to lions, snakes, and other wild animals for food.

Peter testified as follows: how, nineteen years before, at the time of the fair in Poligny, the most violent downpour had so scattered the herd he was tending that he did not know how he should find them again; and how, while searching for the cattle, he met and saw three black riders. The last among these, on being asked what drove him, after he had complained of his distress to him, bade him be of good courage, and promised him: if he would give himself over to him, he would give him a master who would assist him so that henceforth he would suffer no damage to his herd from wolf or any other beast, or from any other source. In confirmation of what was said, he promised him the recovery of all the cattle now lost, and in addition money.\n\nHe had accepted the condition, and had said he would present himself at the same place in 4--5 days. Since the cattle had indeed been found, he had also returned to his rider on the third day, who asked him whether he really wished to surrender himself to him. On the question from his side, who then he might be, he had replied: The servant of the great prince of hell; but fear not on that account! They had now concluded an agreement together, renouncing the Christian faith; whereupon he had offered him his left, black, and cold hand to kiss; but he had now knelt before him, and had greeted him---who later called himself Moyse, and forbade him all church attendance---as his lord. \\[Page 312\\]\n\nThis had gone on in such a way for two years, but the art of protecting the cattle had not been imparted to him; only the spirit, as it seemed, had taken care of it for him when wolves perhaps appeared. Soon after being relieved of the care of the herd, he had neglected Moyse, and had again taken part in church services for about 8--9 years; until M. Verdung induced him to renew the pact on the condition that the promised money be procured.\n\nThe meeting took place in the evening in Chastel Charlon in the forest; where many others, with blue-burning green candles in their hands, had gathered. One day Berdung, who also had a spirit named Guillemin, spoke to him thus: if he would only believe him, he would bring it about that he might proceed in his running with any desired speed. He allowed this, upon the promise of new monetary payments, and this one then anointed him, after he had stripped himself naked, with an ointment that he had with him; whereupon he immediately believed that he was transformed into a true wolf. It horrified him when he beheld the four wolf's feet and his wolf's hair; but now in his running he was borne along, swift as the wind, and this could only have come to pass through the aid of his master, who was immediately present at such a flight; although he did not see him until after he had regained his human form.\n\nMichael, anointed in like manner, had moved away with equally desired speed, such that the eye could not follow. If this had continued for one or two hours, then, when Michael had anointed himself and him anew, the human form had returned more swiftly than one might have thought; but the ointment both had received from their masters. When, after such a run, he had complained to Michael of exhaustion, scarcely able to hold himself upright; then this one had replied: this was all nothing, and it would soon pass of itself. Once, however, when he had anointed himself according to the other's instructions, he had seized a boy of six or seven years with his teeth, and killed him; but since he had to abandon him on account of the noise and howling, he had run back to his clothes, where through the other herbal ointment he had returned to human form. \\[Page 313\\]\n\nMichael had accomplished the like, and one day in wolf's form had killed a woman who was putting in peas; but the lord of Chusn\u00e9e had come upon them, and since they had also attacked him, they had not come to their purpose. Both likewise confessed how they had killed a four-year-old girl and devoured her all but the arm; the flesh had tasted good to Michael, although he had eaten but little; but it had in no wise agreed with his stomach. From another girl they had sucked the blood and devoured the neck; an eight- or nine-year-old child Peter had strangled, because it had earlier denied him alms; and after the deed, immediately at the same spot, he had begged alms for the sake of God. Michael had been transformed into a wolf even when clothed, but Peter only when naked; he also did not know how to say what had become of the hair when he regained human form. He had also run with she-wolves, and that with great lust; sometimes too the time of transformation had passed more swiftly than wished and expected.

They added: also an ashen-gray powder had been given to them, with which they had rubbed the left arm and hand; whereby every animal that they touched with it had perished.\n\nThe second case has emerged yet more clearly and distinctly. In the year 1603 there was conducted before the Parliament of Bordeaux, under the presidency of the first president Daffis, a jurist then renowned throughout all France for his insight and ability, the trial of such a werewolf-man from Roche Chalais in the land of Guienne; and the records of this well-conducted trial de Lanere has excerpted in his book\u00b9); from which excerpt the following circumstances stand forth as essential. \\[Page 314\\]\n\nThe ordinary judge had conducted the first examination on the spot, in the village of Paulot, upon the rumor: how there on the previous day a wolf had attacked a young girl, Margaretha Poirier; and how a youth of 13--14 years, Jean Grenier, in service with Peter Combaut, had boasted: that he had been the one who attacked her in wolf form, and would have devoured her if she had not driven him off with a stick. The attacked girl was re-examined by three witnesses, and had usually tended the cattle with Grenier. On such occasions, he had often told her: how he, transforming himself into a wolf at will, had already torn apart several dogs and two children; but that dog flesh was not as good to eat as that of children. One day, while they were again with the herd, a wild animal had thrown itself upon her, seizing her by her clothing at the right hip and tearing it; whereupon she had struck at it with her stick. But the animal had then withdrawn 10--12 paces from her, and, setting itself up on its hind legs like a dog, had looked at her with a furious gaze; so that she had run away in full terror. The animal had been thicker and smaller than a wolf, had also had a smaller head, along with brown hair and a small tail. The third witness, Jeanne Gaboriant, 18 years old, reported on various things he had said. When asked why he was now so black, he had replied: that it came from the wolf skin which Pierre Labourant, who lay chained in a mighty chain, had given him, and had told him thereby: if he put it on, he could transform himself into a wolf or any other animal. He had then done this many times, and had run about each time at the waning moon, on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays, but only one hour of the day, toward evening or morning; theirs, however, were nine, of whom he named some who ran with one another. 1) Tableau de la Constance p.\u00a0252--326. 470\n\nThis seemed sufficient to place the accused in custody; and when examined in it, he confessed voluntarily more than the witnesses had stated. He was the son of the day laborer Peter Grenier, whom he had left three months before because he had beaten him harshly; after which he had wandered about in the area of Courtras partly on beggary, partly in the service of various masters. Once a young man named Peter of the house Tilhaire had found him on the road, and had said to him: in the forest of St.\u00a0Anton there lives a gentleman who wishes to speak with you. When he had gone with him, they had found him dressed in black, on a black horse; and when they had greeted him, he had dismounted, and had kissed him with a very cold mouth; then commanded him to present himself each time he desired it, and had ridden away. This had happened three years before, when he had been 10--11 years old; and they had seen him three more times thereafter. He had let him groom his horse, had promised him money, and had handed him a glass of wine, after which he had gone his way again. But before that, he had been marked by him with a sort of spit that he carried, under the buttocks; where indeed a small, round, insensitive mark, in the form of a seal, was found on him. He confirmed the statement of Marg. Poirier as completely true, and confessed: how once at the villages of de la Doubla he had gone into a house, and had carried a child in the cradle, which he had found alone, behind a palisade in the garden; had eaten as much of it as he pleased, and had left the rest to a wolf that had been nearby. So he named several others with whom he had proceeded in the same way; but without tearing their clothes, as wolves do, rather pulling them off. He ran at the waning moon, 1--2 hours in the day, and sometimes in the night; but also on church festivals, on the day before Pentecost, in Lent, and especially in Holy Week. \\[Page 315\\]\n\nThe Lord of the Forest would then give him, every time he wished to let him run, the wolf's skin and the ointment, both of which he kept with him; and he would immediately wrap the one around himself, and anoint himself naked with the other. Peter de la Tilhaire likewise possessed such a one, and they had run together four times; without, however, killing anyone together. His father, likewise a runner, had taken him along on the run several times, and they had once together killed and eaten a girl near Grillaut. After the running, he found himself very fatigued, and his hands and feet bloody, torn by thorns and thistles. The nail of his left thumb was thick, long, and claw-like; he had had to let it grow thus at the command of the Lord of the Forest. This one did not let him out of his sight as long as he had the wolf's form; but as soon as he, the accused, lost sight of him, he returned to human form.\n\nHe was now handed over to two physicians for examination, and they found him in spirit dull, limited, and ignorant; moreover, of a black-bilious and melancholic temperament; they declared, however, that in their opinion he in no way suffered from the wolf-sickness. At the same time, the fathers of the children whom the accused had named as eaten had also been summoned and confronted with him, and it emerged that they agreed with his depositions with regard to time and place, the form of the werewolf, the wounds, the aid that the relatives had provided, the weapons or sticks that they had carried, the words with which they had shouted at the wolf, down to the smallest details. Once he had selected the tenderest and fattest out of three children, and had recounted how the brother of the father of the three children had driven him off armed, and as he fled, had called after him: je karroumteray bien. \\[Page 316\\]\n\nThe children were presented to the judge; the attacked and wounded one was indeed the plumpest among the three; and Jean Roullier, their father, testified how the brother had truly used those words. They went even further, and had him led through all the villages and houses where he had run, according to his statement; and when in one of them he found the man who had spoken those words, he recognized him at once among many others, and seized him by the arm. Marg. Poirier was also brought forward; he recognized her at once among four or five girls, and she him in turn, and showed the officials and him the wounds at mouth and chin that were not yet fully healed. His father too was heard and confronted with him; the son wavered somewhat in his statements when he saw him, and it was ascertained that misery and imprisonment had made him dull. But after some rest, he stood by his earlier statement against him; which also went to this: that his mother had separated from him because she had once seen him gnaw on dogs' feet and children's hands. The decision of the Parliament was as wise as the conduct of the entire trial was exemplary. The court ruled: the boy, whom the demon had armed against other children, must not be given up as lost; all the more so, since according to the report of the clergy who had taken charge of him, he had already begun to abhor his crime; which was evident in many tears and gave hope of winning him back to God and a better way of life. Considering, however, that he must be removed from the sight of the inhabitants of the villages where he had committed his crimes, and placed in such a situation that on the one hand a nature so neglected and estranged from the fear of God need no longer be feared; on the other hand, however, that it might be enabled to bring him back to better paths, the council has sentenced Jean Grenier: to be locked up for life in a monastery of the city, to be of service to it all that time; and under penalty of death forbidding him ever to remove himself from this place of confinement.\n\nHis father and Peter, called Tilhaire, were detained for f"}, "De Lancre's Visit to Jean Grenier in Monastery": {"start_char": 1014839, "end_char": 1018276, "pages": "316-318", "keywords": ["- lancre visit to jean grenier 1610"], "verbatim": "tion, but after a month's term, however, released. There in his monastery, de Lancre visited him later in 1610, and learned from him still much that was significant. He was then a young man, 20--21 years old, of medium height, rather small for his age; he had wild, small, deeply set, black, unruly eyes, whose expression showed that he was ashamed of his former state, of which he had some knowledge, and dared not look anyone in the face. He had very long, light, more than usually broad, somewhat blackened, and damaged and worn teeth from gnawing around with the animals. His nails were long, and some black from the root to the tip, among them also the thumbnail, which the forest lord had forbidden him to cut; and these thus blackened ones were also half worn down, and otherwise still extraordinary, because he had used his hands in the manner of feet. \\[Page 317\\]\n\nHe was somewhat dull-witted, yet not so much that he would have been senseless on that account, and he carried out quickly what the good Carmelites, who had taken charge of him with love, commanded him. He showed little spirit, and struggled with things that required only plain human understanding; like one who had always spent his time with the herds, and seen nothing of the world. He made no secret of the fact that he had been a werewolf, and that he had run across the land on the command of the forest lord; and he only said that this was not shameful to him, since he had ceased to be such. But he also confessed without concealment: that he still felt a great lust within himself to eat the flesh of children; especially that of young girls was a delicacy.\n\nTo the question: whether he would perhaps still eat such things, if he were allowed? he answered honestly: Yes. Also the clergy told how they, in the beginning of his stay in the monastery, had sometimes seen him secretly devour the removed entrails of fish. He also once had a wondrous skill in going on all fours, and jumping over ditches like the animals. De Lancre remembered thereby another boy from Saint Pa, who had run as fast as a fleeing dog; knew how to turn around so swiftly that one scarcely noticed it, and sprang over the ditches like a gust of wind. Grenier also assured him: how he had had a wolf skin, which the lord had given him in the forest of Droilha, in the marquisate of FronSac, and which he had hidden on the roof of a barn in his village; yet he had not always brought it to him when he had let him run. His father had likewise made use of it, and on that account, and because he had let him grow up so badly, he expressed great aversion toward him; he also never wanted to see him, although he came to the monastery several times. In contrast, he had a quite special pleasure in seeing wolves, and this affection might well be mutual; since in his interrogations he had often testified: how he had always left the greater part of the prey to the accompanying wolves. His forest lord, moreover, he abhorred and cursed at that time, and said of him: how he had visited him still twice at the beginning of his stay in the monastery, which had frightened him greatly. He had promised him much money if he would serve him again; yet he had soon departed again, because he had more often made the sign of the cross against him; which he also still did now and then, so that he would not return.

He then cast her down at the feet of the exorcist; she rolled about there terribly, and clasped his knees several times, while the Magnificat was being sung in the church. Suddenly she stretched out her arms, which then stiffened together at the hands; and thrown upon the altar step, and leaning her head against the feet of the one performing the exorcism, she turned the profile of the latter toward the window for some of those present; and these now saw the figure of a cross upon the forehead, incised into the first and second skin, from which fresh and red blood welled forth. Since the Protestants present said that she could have imprinted this mark upon herself in her convulsions with a concealed iron in the form of a cross, which nevertheless seemed impossible given the stiffening of her arms; a repetition of the act followed later, shaping itself slowly before the eyes of the spectators.

Nozat, secretary of that commission; where Father Surin,---whom the most holy Archbishop of Tours had urged in a letter to conduct the exorcism in such a way that it would lead to an edifying result for the English lord Montagu,---earnestly exorcised the prioress of this convent, in the presence of that lord Montagu, and of the lords Killegren and Seandrel, both English gentlemen, as well as several other respected persons. \\[Page 323\\]\n\nWhen he now pronounced the exorcism over the kneeling woman, she leaned backward onto her heels; and as she held her left arm, in the sight of all those present, up in the air, we, along with other bystanders---namely, Monsieur de Morans, vicegerent of Monsieur de Poitiers, the Fathers Anginot and Bachelerie of the Society of Jesus, Father Luc, a Capuchin, that English gentleman, Monsieur du Fresne, a citizen of Loudun, and Father Surin---saw, on the upper part of the hand of the aforementioned prioress, bloody letters forming themselves, which combined to form the name Joseph.

Haan. An innocent, pious, twenty-two-year-old woman, of melancholic temperament, was seized in the evening of November 8, 1684, with shortness of breath, and in the night with sleepiness; and in the morning, upon rising, she saw two blue spots in both hands, and from the wrist to the bend of the elbow the arm marked with various cracks; over the elbow, however, inscribed with letters, especially N B, and interspersed with the sign of the cross. The next morning, after she had been at a wedding, she found the number of crosses---longer and shorter, deeper or shallower incised---increased by new ones on the neck, the breast, down to the abdomen; and within seven days the entire skin from the head to the heel was covered with them, and rough to the touch.\n\nThe face had at first remained untouched, but in the end it too was marked, though only lightly. On November 11, she had moaned in her sleep and wrung her hands; she had therefore been awakened, and needles were found thrust into both hands; which later played a role in various visions, along with an old woman who demanded them from her and struck her. Later, other needles had to be pulled from the soles of her feet, and on November 16 she was found outside her bed under a bench. In between, then, in the third, fourth, sixth, and tenth nights, new crosses were impressed upon her, then the signs of the planets, their aspects, and those of the simplest chemical preparations, all of which she knew well and with which she was accustomed to occupy herself for her instruction. The affliction diminished gradually until January 21, 1635; only that, as she was sewing at her neighbor's on that day, on the right a cloverleaf, on the left a trefoil, with the year 1635 lightly but clearly depicted, appeared. On both, the year showed a heart pierced with arrows, and beside it the image of a fool, with the inscription: Fool!

At once the child lowered his head, and his piteous weeping showed how it fared with him. As the weakness of the little one, whom they had carried home, kept increasing, the people judged that it came from the old woman, who had long stood in ill repute. The neighbors therefore pressed upon her that she should go and make the child healthy again. She was willing, and as soon as she came into his vicinity, she began to fall ill in the same manner as he himself. Her mouth turned blue, and a foam appeared before it; so that those present were horrified by it, and believed nothing else than that she would become rabid.\n\nSince night had fallen in the meantime, she insisted absolutely on remaining in bed with the child; once she laid her outstretched arms upon it, held her mouth to his, as if she wished to drive back the faltering breath.

At first he was laughed at by those to whom he communicated this summons; yet he boldly attempted the thing, and it succeeded. For a time he confined himself to this ailment; but soon the voice admonished him: to try himself also on the ague, which then raged epidemically. \\[Page 326\\]\n\nWhen he now laid his hand upon a woman and added a formula, the fever departed at once, and the woman recovered. Now he expanded the circle of his practice, countless testimonies of the efficacy of his laying on of hands spread his fame. People began to call him the Antichrist of the doctors; sick persons of every kind spared no expense to reach him; while he, contenting himself with fulfilling the duties of human love, turned away every other reward from his hand. Besides the healing of scrofula, leprosy, and fevers, he restored sight and hearing, and gave paralyzed limbs back their vital force.\n\nHe laid his hands on the epileptic, and their convulsions immediately ceased; the movements of the fever stopped at once; sensation and activity were restored, and the illness was forever lifted. On a single day, the hands were laid upon as many as sixty persons at once. An eyewitness reports: several among these sick ones had been afflicted with the falling sickness, and some among these, seized by their ailment, had lain in the same room; he had been called to their aid, and he, leaving other patients, had hastened to them. While the afflicted ones now lay foaming at the mouth and rolling on the ground, he had struck them on the chest with his hand, and immediately their attack had ceased, and they had risen, saying that they felt very well. His procedure was very simple: at times he rubbed the afflicted limb, at times he spat upon it; he placed his fingers in the ear of the deaf, and they became hearing.\n\nAt times he also made use of repulsive means for the restoration. But, unlike his superstitious contemporaries, he employed no magical remedies or special words; rather, he spoke only a sort of short ejaculatory prayer before the manipulation, and once the healing had occurred, he then reminded the patient to give glory to God. His warmest admirers attributed the miraculous power to a peculiar temperament of his organism, from which a sort of beneficent influence streamed forth. He himself, especially in the consciousness of the time when he had acquired the gift and of the effects that followed, sought it in a power that dwelt in his hands.\n\nBefore he possessed it, he had namely noticed that, when he had severe headaches, the laying on of hands was utterly ineffective; afterward, when he had gained the power, he needed only to bring his hand to his head, and he was healed. Of other patients he was wont to say: their ailment jumped and fled from place to place, just as he changed the position of his hands, until it was finally driven out. Even the laying on of his gloves was not ineffective, though by no means so with other items of his clothing.\n\nCountless testimonies from the healed, from physicians and persons of higher rank, attested to this healing power of his; but he experienced what all earlier and later ones have experienced: envy and jealousy arose against the man who would perform miracles, after---as they said---the time of miracles had long passed; the tongue denied the eye, the rubbing had been the sole effective palliative.

In the meantime, it has been believed, especially that the air-sphere, this earth-encompassing ocean of a volatile, mobile element open to all impressions and equalizing all, yields itself most readily to such influences from the spiritual side; and thus at all times has ascribed to magically heightened life a disturbing influence upon the atmosphere.\n\nThis belief came particularly to light at the end of the sixteenth century in a process that became famous; at that time, when the insipidly pedantic James of Scotland had been drawn, by a band of ecstatic women under the leadership of a schoolmaster, into a heroic drama in the enchanted forest, and now personally conducted the investigation of this wondrous affair himself. In a fit of romance, he had sailed across to Norway in the year 1590 with a fleet to fetch his queen himself.\n\nOn the homeward voyage, while the whole fleet sailed along in favorable winds, his ship alone encountered headwinds, so that it made only laborious progress forward; moreover, a boat carrying jewels for the queen went under in the storm between Leith and Kinghorn. This was now all the work of those women, as was discovered after the king's return. Geillis Duncan, who served at Bailie Seaton's, had for some time been performing various healings that aroused her master's suspicion, until at last he had the thumbscrews applied to her, whereupon she confessed that the cures had been accomplished by the devil's help, and now named many others as accomplices and witches. Thus: Agnes Sampson, the eldest of them all; Agnes Thompson of Edinburgh, the wife of George Mott; Barbara Napier; and Euphemia MacCalzean, the daughter of the Lord of Cliftonhall, one of the members of the justice college; many other women were likewise named by her, and also men, among them especially Doctor Fian, otherwise called John Cunningham, schoolmaster of Saltpans in Lothian, who among the others was regarded as the devil's secretary.\n\nAll were arrested, but Agnes Sampson was first brought before the king in Holyrood House. She denied everything at the outset, but was tortured, and now confessed such strange and wondrous things that James himself declared her a liar. She replied, however, that it would not be good if His Majesty did not believe her words; she therefore offered to communicate things to him that would dispel every doubt in him. She now took the king a little aside and told him all the words that had passed between him and the queen in their wedding night in Oslo in Norway, with all the answers that one had made to the other; so that His Majesty was highly astonished, and swore by the living God that all the devils in hell could not have invented the like, so deeply was it grounded in truth; from then on he believed her statements. \\[Page 331\\]\n\nShe now related how the whole fellowship had resolved to raise a destructive storm on the sea against the king on that voyage. Satan had first wanted to let a fog arise, so that his ship would strand on the English coast; but since that did not seem sure to succeed, Fian, the schoolmaster, wrote to Marion Linkup, a famous witch, and to the others of the sisterhood, and summoned them all to meet at sea with their master within five days, in order to destroy the king in common. On the eve of All Saints' Day they assembled, some four hundred persons strong, at the appointed place, and each embarked in a sieve, merry and in good spirits. After some cruising about, Satan appeared and gave a cat to Robert Grierson; with the cry \"Hola!\" it was to be thrown into the sea, and the desired storm would then follow. Even earlier, six witches had bought such a cat in the weaver's house; two had seized the iron hook of the hearth, the animal had then been pulled three times through the ring of the hook, and driven three times under the hearth. To its four legs had then been bound main limbs of men, and when it was thrown into the sea after midnight, the storm had come there too, which had swallowed that boat.\n\nWhen the sieve-farers had completed their business, they landed at the church of North Berwick in Lothian, first drank wine from their sieves, and then, more than a hundred in number, went two by two to the church to observe the Sabbath. Geillis Duncan danced ahead and sang to the harp the lay:\n\n> Commer, goe ye before, Commer, goe fe\\\n> Cit she will not goe before, Commer, lei me.\n\nFian acted as master of ceremonies in the church, opened the doors and lit the lights, while Gray Meill served as doorkeeper. The demon appeared as preacher; his body was hard as iron, as it seemed to those who touched him; his face terrible, his nose like the beak of an eagle, claws on hands and feet like a griffin, his eyes gray and burning, his voice hollow. He delivered an exhortation to those present to henceforth carry out all evil, after which the homage followed in the usual manner.\n\nThe king had Geillis Duncan brought forward; her testimony agreed most perfectly with what Sampson had said, whom Spottiswoode describes as a worthy and truthful matron in her statements. She had to play that lay on the harp for him; the king, who was present at all the interrogations, marveled at the agreement of the testimonies, which also remained consistent in the confessions of Fian and all those who were present; and even now sets all English reviewers in wonder, that they declare it the most insoluble problem in the philosophy of Scottish history (sic).

For it has namely fallen to the theologians, above all, to instruct the judges and the physicians concerning the degree of influence that the demon can gain over human nature.\n\nWhat power does he possess by nature, what has he acquired for himself in addition, and on what can he, over against the Christian church, lay claim? These are questions whose discussion must precede every accusation of alliance with him. The first witchcraft trial is, after the first Fall, brought and decided before the judgment seat of God. The first-created tribal heads of the race had passed by the well of the water of life, and had drunk from the magic well. The dragon had beguiled them with cunning, and they had concluded the alliance of servitude with him.\n\nThe woman had first believed him: that, where she ate, she would become clairvoyant, and like the Elohim in discerning good and evil; powerful over both, and therefore by no means obligated to death. Thus, in eating at the table of the Sabbath of its fruit, she had committed an outrage against the Lord, and brought the husband to the same deed through partaking with her. Now God, the all-discerner, sits in judgment, and the inquisition begins. The accused are summoned; they are themselves the witnesses of their guilt, for since they have become clairvoyant, their fear and their shame must loudly proclaim that they have now taken evil into themselves. \\[Page 345\\]\n\nThe man shifts the blame onto the woman, this one onto the dragon; to him, as the first instigator, the judgment is therefore pronounced first of all. The curse strikes him amid all the animals; he shall not stand upright, but shall wallow on his belly and eat dust all the days of his life. To the bond that he has knotted with the woman, the enmity between his seed and hers shall set itself in opposition. The heel, the outermost part of the one, is given over to him; but she, in return, shall trample his innermost and highest. To the woman is imposed the toil and the pain of childbirth, and she is given into subjection to the man; to this one, however, a toilsome life on the earth made thorny for him, until he returns to her from whom he was taken.\n\nThus was the judgment held, as only God could hold it, with complete insight into the matter at hand; the punishments, however, not like ones casually alighting on the individual, but springing from the offense itself; hence also not confining themselves to the individual, but inhering in the whole race. It had wholly fallen prey to death, which was awarded in common to all the condemned; and indeed it was not merely the bodily death, but also the spiritual one that was consigned to it; namely, the fall and the reprobation, of which the former is only a sign full of meaning. After the times had run their course, a second judgment was held. Because to the seducing spirit, in a contemplative beholding of the present, there also belongs a will that is similarly firm, constant, and unchangeable; thus the fall and reprobation were irrevocably fixed for him. But because to the seduced ones, united in body and soul, there inhabits a discursive mode of thinking, and thus also a will that is mobile in like manner; therefore history was allotted to them for expiation, under favorable assistance. In its unfolding, the enmity set between the seed of the woman and the seed of the dragon worked its effect; the blood purified itself in the one race to the degree that it poisoned itself in the other; for this separation was the task of the ancient time.\n\nThe chosen people had therefore separated itself from the other peoples; in it, pride and hypocrisy again drove to the left, just as humility and piety tended to the right. With the latter stood God; the other side was the dragon's side; but they believed in him more than in God, because they took his illusory image for the image of God. When at last the opposites had come to their simplest expression, when on the one side God had hidden himself in the Incarnation, on the other the dragon had disguised himself in possession; then the hour of judgment had arrived. But this time it appeared as if not the true God were going to judge over the evil one and his followers, but the reverse; the evil one had summoned the tribunal, his followers sat on the judges' seats, and it seemed as though the reprobate were to pronounce judgment over the one who reproved. The blind ones judged: it was not they, but He who had allied himself with Beelzebub, and, as a sorcerer, had wrought signs and wonders through his power. \\[Page 346\\]\n\nThey therefore condemned him to death, and thus the auto-da-f\u00e9 was held on Golgotha. Hell rejoiced; the gray bonds of the left had triumphed over the fellowship of the covenant on the right; the ancient prophecy had been brought to shame: for the seed of the dragon had crushed the head of the seed of the woman, since the slayer of the serpent had himself been entwined and slain by the serpent's own coils. Then the wonders of providence suddenly became manifest. Sin, brought forth through the misuse of freedom and stepping in between God and the creature, had also split soul and body apart within it, and thus carried death into them.\n\nThe restoration could only take place by God, through union with the creature preserved in the same temptation, casting out the divisive sin, and that creature now going with freedom into death, thereby atoning for and expelling the sin that had intruded between body and soul. The moment of death, which Hell in its judgment pronounced over the victim, was therefore the instant of its defeat; the wounded heel had only brought about the physical death, but the resurrection shattered the dragon's head; the prophecy was fulfilled, the spiritual death was averted for all who held to the Victor. But the act was also exemplary, enclosing within itself the whole history and its future; therefore in this resurrection was also prefigured the destruction of physical death at the end of the atoning history and the restoration of all things.\n\nThe serpent-treader thus stands ever since upon the head of the dragon; the stone upon which his church is built has been rolled away from him; the center and core of his power has been taken from him, only the outwardly deeper, as it were the animal element, has remained to him; and he still convulsively entwines with the "}, "Trois Echelles Confesses to Sabbath, Arts with Spirit, and Names Accomplices": {"start_char": 1111233, "end_char": 1112474, "pages": "346-347", "keywords": ["trois echelles confesses to sabbath arts with spirit and names accomplices"], "verbatim": "He no longer has the might to infect entire peoples, so that other peoples must be mustered against them to ward off the pestilence.

We shall consult experience on this, and we choose an event that took place far away across seas, in a Protestant land, among entirely unprepared people. In the year 1602, in New England, in Salem and Dover and the region around Boston, a series of events occurred that cost many people their lives. Two years earlier, in the house of a resident there, Goodwin, a young girl, otherwise of good character, had fallen into obsession; Cotton Mather had taken her into his house and made a report about it known. She had stated that, when her paroxysm approached, someone brought her an invisible horse. She then jumped onto a chair, positioned herself in the posture of a rider, and began to kick and stamp and gallop. She spoke with invisible company that wandered about with her, and listened to their answers. After two or three minutes, she seemed to imagine that she was at a distant place with the witches at an assembly; after which she later, on her invisible horse, returned again, and soon thereafter came back to herself, and told all sorts of things about the Sabbath and the "}, "Parris Family and Neighbors' Strange Afflictions and Accusations": {"start_char": 1131240, "end_char": 1132288, "pages": "353", "keywords": ["- parris family afflictions"], "verbatim": "She then jumped onto a chair, positioned herself in the posture of a rider, and began to kick and stamp and gallop.

Now it happened that at the end of February 1692, various young persons belonging to the family of the preacher Parris in Salem, and still several others in the neighborhood, began to behave in a strange and unusual manner.

One sees: their power of judgment was in no way equal to even the most frequently occurring cases of ordinary criminality.\n\nWhoever had once mounted the airy steed in this fork-riding, had completely withdrawn himself from the jurisdiction of earthly judges; he had literally risen above the law; whatever he might do, practice, and effect, whatever crimes he might heap up, all these criminal deeds, as long as they remained in this airy realm, were like gusts of wind; and even if a spark from them struck downward, the invisible origin could not be traced; the scales of justice had only foam and dream to weigh; a burden for which no system of measure and weight had yet been found, not even a balance. The judges, therefore, had to count themselves fortunate if a simple case, still within the scope of their jurisdiction, was brought before them; if tangible and weighable crimes had emanated from this transcendent source, and if an unforced, voluntary confession confirmed this origin. Such a case then undoubtedly fell under their court's authority, and it was probably the only combination in which they could exercise it with the best conscience and with success.\n\nThey then had only to ascertain the crimes themselves in their practical aspect; with regard to their origin, to establish the imputability and mental presence of the accused; and then confidently to pronounce the judgment in accordance with the laws. If these conditions are fulfilled with conscientiousness, attention, and insight, then in these matters the good observance is formed.\n\n#### A. The Good and Secure Practice\n\nThere is no lack, neither in ecclesiastical nor in secular courts, of examples of the most blameless administration of justice in such cases. We select from them only one, the case of del Vaulx in Stablo, because of its rounded completeness, and because the judge himself recounts it from the records. Chapeauville, canon in Li\u00e8ge, reports the following about this legal proceeding. In the year 1595, Johannes del Vaulx, a member of the old and famous monastery of Stablo, had been imprisoned by his prior on suspicion of poisoning and other crimes; which, when it came to the knowledge of the abbot and administrator of the monastery, prompted him to send me there.\n\nI saw the man, who by God's grace had grown weary of the demon's tyranny, and who, in the first conversation with me and the prior, opened up his entire life to us with many tears. For when he had tended the herds of his elders, and his boyhood had already been stained with abominable crimes, after his fifteenth year had arrived, he had seen an old man in long and seemingly clerical garb walking through the forest, who asked him: whether he would serve him and obey him? He would, as a reward, bring him to high honors in the state that he himself chose, to which he had then boldly agreed at once. \\[Page 363\\]\n\nAfterwards, he appeared to him in other and ever other monstrous forms, and also pressed into his shoulders two marks, which we examined; then carried him to the nocturnal assemblies, over many places, and provided him with poisons, with which he killed the cattle of the elders and of others, and also, in addition, human beings; and then accompanied him on his studies to Trier. On his advice, he then took the habit and immediately the orders of the priesthood; and removed the prior along with other order clerics, in order to gain the priory, by poison. But he had still many participants in his crimes and malefactions.\n\nWhen I reported this to the prelate, he resolved: to have the case judged in the legal manner. He therefore sent the reverend Mr.\u00a0A. Stregnart, suffragan, and me with a notary once more to Stablo; we interrogated him on all individual articles, and recorded his statements in writing. Since we noticed during the interrogation that the demon had taught him many pagan and heretical errors; we instructed him in the doctrine of the one and triune God, of the good and evil spirits, of immortality, of the future life, as well as in some other fundamental doctrines of our faith. The prelate wanted: that a thorough examination be conducted with him, so that, if he were brought to true repentance and stood by his statements --- but he accused more than 500 accomplices ---, these testimonies might have all the greater credence.\n\nAfter weighing the confession and the accusations made, the prelate dispatched a commission to his principality of Stablo; whereby he transferred to his suffragan A. Stregnart, to me his general vicar, then to Father Oranus, pro-chancellor of his council and assessor of Li\u00e8ge, as well as to Mr.\u00a0Molempeter, advocate of the fisc, all authority: to judge over the whole matter, to pass sentence, to execute the judgment; and if necessary, to call in the ordinary and feudal judges, knowledgeable in the laws and customs. In consequence thereof, we set out at the beginning of 1500 for Stablo, in a carriage which broke in two in the middle on the way; so that we had to cover the rest of the journey on horseback. We arrived still in the evening at the monastery, and visited the prisoner, who, upon our greeting, without returning it, at once brought forward excuses regarding the incident with the broken wagon.\n\nNot his demon, he said, who had never done him any harm, had caused it; but another evil-minded one had committed it. At the break of the following day, he was examined and interrogated on the articles fixed by the fisc, and he persisted steadfastly in his first confession, not only naming his accomplices, but also specifying precisely: to which sodality they belonged; whither he had been nocturnally abducted with them; what criminal acts had been practiced there, what had been done in honor of the presiding demon; in what order the banquets had been held, the minglings had taken place, and the enchantments of humans, cattle, and fruits had been performed. \\[Page 364\\]\n\nThe names, status, and circumstances of the accused persons were thereby determined with the utmost precision. But we, in order to test the consistency of his words, and to close the mouth of slander, waited some days before visiting him again; then reminded him of his salvation, and warned him that on this account he should beware of falsely accusing anyone. Thereupon we read to him his statements and accusations again, but in reverse and confused order; so that we placed those whom he had put in the first row, say, under the second and third, and vice versa. But he then insisted: that he had not said so, that the words had not been correctly recorded; that the matters stood thus, whereupon he repeated his earlier statements in their order.\n\nWe held it thus more often, for he had accused both clergy and laymen. Thus he said: that he had often visited the Trier assembly, where D. Vlaet, electoral councilor, who was burned there as a sorcerer, had presided; and that he had also had at this place a beautiful and charming girl, a fisherwoman, as his beloved, who after every assembly presented him with fish. After we had heard all this most wondrous from him, we nevertheless interrogated him still more often in formal sessions, treating him mildly and inquiring of him in every way the truth about his life and his deeds; but we found him in all things so steadfast and consistent with himself that we dismissed all suspicion of madness in his mind.\n\nOranus, who now, as I write this (1616), lives at 76 years of age in great vigor, and I myself, we visited him out of Christian love moreover still often in the room wherein he lived; we questioned him often about everything that we had learned in part from writings, in part from his confessions. But he always adduced weighty reasons that proved that what he had confessed had not occurred through deceitful demonic impressions, merely in the imagination, as we suggested and as it seemed probable to us; but rather truly, really, hypostatically and personally encountered him, and he indicated certain signs by which he could recognize when he had actually attended the assemblies and committed this or that, and when merely in the imagination.\n\nWhen we had communicated the records to the prelate, and he recognized more and more the importance of the matter, he commanded us: to open the instruction of the process against the accused, both clergy and laymen; which then throughout the course of this year, up to the tenth of January of the following, was done with equal diligence and equal attention. It had been impressed upon us: not merely to lay hands on old women and men from the common folk, but also against the notables of the place, the mayor named Kannerlink, the judges and the pastor, as well as some religious persons distinguished by age, spirit, learning, and judgment. On the 10th of January 1597, after an advocate and syndicus had been assigned to the prisoner, the articles of accusation of the fiscal were read to him before the assembled court, along with the responses that he had made and maintained thereto thereafter; whereupon he clearly, frankly, and persistently declared and confessed: that he could make no change in the admitted sorceries, nor in the accused persons, or render any retraction, without placing the salvation of his soul in danger. \\[Page 365\\]\n\nSince the fiscal now urgently pressed for the pronouncement of judgment against the confessing accused, the terms set for the verdict were prorogued nine times on account of the importance of the matter; and just as often the guilty one was reminded of the peril of his previous life under the dominion of the devil, and how he had mocked the almighty God, his service, and his religion; he should therefore take care not to rob himself of all hope of salvation through empty and fabricated confessions, or false and slanderous accusations. He said again and repeated himself ever: that he could change nothing in what he had previously confessed, or retract anything whatsoever without lying and perjury. He hoped only for a merciful judgment; and that was his sole, fervent desire, that after renouncing the devil, reconciled once more to the almighty and merciful God, he might obtain his grace. The syndicus, dissatisfied with this, demanded that the clergy of Stablo, who, infected by the poison and still lying sick, be interrogated thereon. Aegidius Harsetanus, the prior, Mauritius of Offl, Quirin of Generet, Cornelius Neufforge, and Paschasius Lymburg were thereupon examined, all of whom testified: how they indeed considered themselves harmed by the poison that their fellow brother Del Baulr, or his companions, had placed in various places in the monastery.\n\nThe syndic now proposed: to proceed according to the records, and to condemn the guilty to be interrogated under torture; so that the confession regarding his accomplices might thereby be proven, and gain greater evidentiary force. This exhortation was made in the presence of the accused, who merely implored the mercy of the Almighty God. Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted: In the matter of J. Vilars, syndic of the Abbey of Stablo, plaintiff, against H. J. Del Vaulr, a member of that monastery, accused of sorcery, which matter remains pending before us, J. Chapeauville, commissioner specially appointed by His Highness; upon the counsel of those learned in divine and human law, to whom the state of the case has been communicated, it is resolved and pronounced: The aforesaid accused shall, before proceeding to the full resolution of his case, be rigorously questioned, and further interrogated under torture. Given on the 19th of March 1597.\n\nWhen this decree became known, amid the bitterness of many of those accused of sorcery, the rumor spread: that we had been dealing with a deranged and senseless man. In order to dispel this rumor, we summoned the lords Ludwig von Viset, prior of Malmedy, a man of proven and tested truthfulness; Hubert von Verlemont; Gabriel Neufforge, steward of Stablo; Remigius Ultrapontanus; Wilhelm Rane, podest\u00e0 of Malmedy; Adolph von Rahier, the schultheiss of Bodeur; P. von Noirfalli, schultheiss of Chenron; as well as other clerics, noble and esteemed men, officials and magistrates, among whom some were also suspected of sorcery. In their collective presence, J. Del Vaulr was now repeatedly questioned anew regarding the confessions and accusations. He always responded undauntedly, steadfastly, and aptly to everything put before him; so that he corrected all the errors and perverse narratives that we had intentionally fabricated, as well as the objections of the suspects, who made them vehemently against him; and, providing good reasons from all sides, he entirely refuted the opinion of his mental derangement.\n\nYet with this, his adversaries were still not pacified, but rather spread about: how, during the time of his imprisonment, he had written letters to the lords de la Bourlotte and de Goberville, as well as to D. de Wils, in which matters were contained that pointed to madness: in that he called them his nephews; and therein promised to do away with all enemies of the Catholic king through his arts and his secrets, and more of the like. \\[Page 366\\]\n\nWhen earnestly questioned, he replied firmly and calmly: that at that time he had played the fool and the delirious, pretending kinship, and spoken of the fall of the king's enemies, so that he might be released from prison on the grounds of madness; on this statement he persisted during three and four interrogations. After all this was concluded in judicial and customary manner, he said, when the acts were repeated from the beginning and translated into the language of the country for those ignorant of Latin, repeatedly: all confessions and accusations written down here are entirely true; and everything he stated therein about persons was truly done and committed. Then he was confronted with J. von Frounille, the pastor of Stablo, whom he accused of sorcery. When D. Oran, extremely experienced in these legal matters, wondered at the categorical denials of the pastor, Del Vaulr removed all his wonder in my presence by explaining to him the secret of silence among sorcerers. A solemn oath is repeated annually over this in all gatherings, and it had not long been taken in that of Stablo; at which he had been present and had recognized the said Frounille very well.\n\nNow the syndic of the court demanded: that all his statements and references, and the confessions of the accused, be read out again, and then the latter, under invocation of God, be questioned on oath and under threat of eternal damnation: whether he persists in his oft-repeated confession, or has anything contrary to testify. The accused, after the punishment for perjury had been solemnly explained to him, answered firmly: all his confessions and accusations are entirely true, and he can and will retract nothing of them. With this testimony the syndic would not be satisfied, but now moved for the application of the rack, not to elicit further confession, but to confirm the one already given; so that the guilty of the crime might have no cause to complain. The accused, when all his testimony was read out to him again, insisted upon it, calling God to witness under oath.\n\nProceedings now advanced to the rack; the accused testified under torture, as the articles of the fiscal were presented to him one by one, at peril of his salvation and damnation: that all and every one he had named had been accomplices in the sorcery; that he had seen and recognized them in the assemblies, and had committed and carried out with them everything he had stated. Earnestly reminded again to consider maturely all that he had said and confessed, and to accuse no one guiltlessly; after prayers and exorcisms had also not been omitted over him, he confessed openly and firmly: everything said and confessed is the pure truth, and no one is slandered or unjustly accused; this he testified on the mercy of God Almighty, to which he, after revoking the vows made to the demon, betook his refuge, and awaited forgiveness for his poor soul, which had hitherto been in a state of despair. Finally, the improbability of so great a number of accomplices and confederates was set before him; which we did to test his reliability, but he nonetheless stood by his word. After common prayers and new exorcisms, he was again urged to say nothing against the truth; under repetition of the solemn oath he remained by his testimonies and accusations, and avowed: that he would hold to them until the end of his life. \\[Page 367\\]\n\nAfter all those present had unanimously reminded him once more of the consequences of perjury and the dangers of false accusation, and he had sworn for the second and third time that he had said nothing against the accused persons except what he himself had seen and heard; he was released from the torture and led to the hearth, unharmed in his limbs, for the torture had been only mild. We had also seen the marks on his shoulders at that time, and tested them with a needle, which we drove deep into them without his feeling any pain from it. Since all this had now thus taken place, the fiscal requested a legally valid transcript of what had occurred, and declared, after receiving it, that he would and must make use of it not only against the accused but also against every other person, as testimony and foundation for every investigation. He further moved that the defendant be summoned for the seventh hour of the second of April, in order to hear his judgment in proper form from the mouth of the commissioner and judge D. \\[something\\] v. Chapeauville. The notification of this summons was thereupon attested by Henricus Harsetanus, the cleric, with his own handwritten signature.\n\nThe judgment read as follows:\n\nWhereas thou, F. Del Baulr, priest and abbot in Stablo, art convicted not only by many reports, witness testimonies, and public rumor, but also by thy oft-repeated confession, of having denied the faith and religion to which thou didst profess thyself at baptism, not merely with thy mouth but also in thy heart and soul, and in opposition thereto of having dedicated thyself to the demon, the enemy of the human race; whereas thou hast worshipped him at the nocturnal assemblies repeatedly; hast also concluded a pact and vow with him in order to commit maleficia, to obtain honors, pleasures, riches, and other earthly goods besides; and, to confirm the pact, hast obtained his marks on thy shoulders; whereas thou hast caused the death of several fellows of the abbey of Stablo, namely the lords Antonius von Salm, the prior of this monastery, Perpetuus, Aegidius Warsegnius, Anton Harsetanus, Heinrich de Rahier, Leonard Fronduille, Corbelius Neufforge, and others of the lay estate, namely Nicolaa, the widow left behind of Heinrich von Houfalize, the wife of the foreman of the same place, and J. v. Morimon, citizen of Stablo, by means of poison which the demon gave thee; and furthermore hast committed many other abominable crimes with demonic succubi, as well as with married and unmarried women; for which thou deserves not only to be deposed from all offices and degrees, but truly degraded and handed over to the secular arm, according to the ordinance of the holy canons.\n\nWe, therefore, in order that such crimes, under the pretext of thy priestly order and monastic vows, may not remain unpunished, but that thou in this life shalt undergo a punishment to some satisfaction for thy sins and vices, for the reparation of the scandal, as an example and terror to the wicked, and for the edification of the pious: do hereby decree by this our final judgment that thou be stripped of all office and every dignity, declared worthy of actual deposition, and handed over to the secular arm; as we now in fact do strip thee of thy offices and dignities, degrade thee, and hand thee over to the secular arm; while however beseeching the judges and officers of the secular jurisdiction that they, insofar as the law permits, may abstain from bloodshed.\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\nGiven on the 2nd of April 150; in the morning at 8 o'clock. \\[Page 368\\]\n\nAfter the reading of this judgment, the degraded and stripped of his dignity was handed over to Prochancellor Oranus and Fiscal Advocate Molempeter, whom the most worthy Suffragan had appointed for this purpose; who now, with the involvement of some notables, wise assessors, and honored persons, after reviewing and carefully weighing the records, decided: J. Del Baulr should be executed with the sword, but then buried in consecrated ground in the churchyard of the monastery. The reason for the mitigated punishment was: because he had been in a state of accusation for five years, and during this time had been confined in a dark dungeon, living on bread and water; and what is more, had proven through his tears and sighs that he felt remorse over the past.\n\nWhen his judgment was read to him, as he knelt dissolving in tears, he thanked them for the "}, "Del Vaulr's Clairvoyant Vision of Judges' Carriage Accident": {"start_char": 1189109, "end_char": 1189495, "pages": "369-370", "keywords": ["del vaulrs clairvoyant vision of judges carriage accident"], "verbatim": "ocedures.

In truth, what are visions other than beholdings into the interior of things, which now represent themselves symbolically; because the hitherto seen exterior is now only a shell and expression for the newly attained and emerging interior. One could easily imagine that a magnetic somnambulist might have the visions of summer and of winter.\n\nThe center of the first would be the sun at the summer solstice. From this center she would see the streams of light and those of warmth descending toward the earth; these would set the electric currents in motion in her vicinity, which, now conjoined with the propelling ones, would quicken the three lower elements---air, water, and earth---so that they in turn would awaken the hidden germs of life, which now would burst forth at all the nodal points of the earth.

The center of the second vision would be the winter pole of the earth, which, in the remoteness of the sun, has selfishly enclosed itself. From this center the binding, congealing forces of darkness and cold would take their origin; they would, if dealing with freedom, murderously destroy all animal and plant extensions down to their germs, and then, burying these germs in the congealed earth, frost them over with rime, pelt them with hail, and cover them with snow; even the element of air would, wingless and bound, lay itself down around the rigid waters for winter's sleep: for everywhere the magnetic force would only rule, and the ancient night "}, "Arras Witchcraft Trial Confessions of Flying to Sabbath and Demonic Worship": {"start_char": 1203361, "end_char": 1205279, "pages": "374", "keywords": ["- confessions of sabbath in ryssel"], "verbatim": "Accordingly, they arrested yet another new accused person, and had the vicars once more admonished by the Count of Estampes to hasten the process.

The people were in despair, and attributed their misery and the unfruitfulness of the years to evil arts and to the witch-folk. In the officials of the time, among whom the distress now also awakened gold-greed, they found all too willing help to render this their belief pernicious to many. Through the whole diocese, all cities and villages, there now ran---as an eyewitness relates---accusers, inquisitors, judges, minions, and executioner's assistants, who seized all suspects and burned them in great numbers; for scarcely one escaped who had once been accused. \\[Page 388\\]\n\nSoon the terror spread also into the city of Trier, and soon spared not even the former blood-judges themselves; for Dietrich Flade, rector of the university and city schultheiss, who had led a great multitude of those unfortunates to the stake, was burned in 1586 according to the rules of his own judicial procedure. Him followed in death two mayors and several senators and judges. Canons of several chapters, pastors, rural deans had the same fate. In two villages at about the same time only two women remained; for the fury of the people and the madness of the judges had only ever increased; so that scarcely one remained whom suspicion had not struck. The notaries, the actuaries, and the innkeepers enriched themselves meanwhile; the executioner rode like a courtier on a high horse, clad in gold and silver; his wife vied in finery with the nobles.\n\nThe children of the condemned wandered forth, their goods were confiscated. There began to be a shortage of field hands and vinedressers; hence the unfruitfulness. Scarcely, men thought, had a worse plague ever raged in the archbishopric, or a madder foe wreaked havoc, than these trackers, who struck so many for whose innocence there was manifold likelihood. The persecution lasted several years; many of the superiors boasted of the multitude of pyres they had erected. Impoverishment was the consequence: now laws were given and enforced against the abomination, and now it died out, just as the war died out with the exhaustion of the money, so the fury of the witch-judges.

That introduced a new error into the matter. The exorcists, aware of their power in the obsessions brought about by magic, came upon the idea of making use of this power to compel the demon against his will to bear witness to the truth, and thus to spy out the secrets of his realm through himself.\n\nFor the first time, to our knowledge, use was made thereof in the matter of the Count of Gaftedy: Magdalena von Palnd, his betrothed, had, against his will and at the age of fourteen, entered the convent of the holy Ursula, and had placed herself under the obedience of Father Romillon, a former Calvinist. As she thereupon fell into a possession, the peace of the convent was suddenly disturbed thereby; for five of the sisters residing there soon found themselves likewise possessed. Among them was one in particular who was most affected by it, Louise Capelle, from the county of Avignon, likewise descended from heretical parents, originating in St.\u00a0Remi, near that county; a simple, pious girl skilled in household tasks. Magdalena was for a long time unsuccessfully exorcised in secret, but then taken to St.\u00a0Baume, and there given over to continued exorcism to Father F. Dompt, a Fleming, Doctor of Theology at Louvain and a Dominican. With her had come Louise, to manage the household, who at that time was not yet suspected of possession; which, however, soon betrayed itself through tone and glance; while Magdalena, in her attacks, was repeatedly lifted into the air to tear her from the exorcist who held her. \\[Page 389\\]\n\nOn the eighth of December 1610, the spirits of Louise named themselves: first Verin the superior, and then Gressil and Sonnillon, his subordinates. On the day of the Conception of Mary, Verin began through her mouth to deliver a great eulogy of the blessed Virgin, concluding it thus: that he spoke not out of love for her, but compelled by fear of God, who is able to call forth all things from nothing. Catherine of France, an ecstatic sister, brought Magdalena there during this speech; and now Verin, upon beholding her, began to call out to the stronger demon who dwelt in the one present: \"Though thou art my master, yet one greater than thou wills that I now speak in thy presence.\"\n\nThen this one rose up raging in Magdalena, bellowed like a bull, and threw her shoe at the speaker's head. But Verin continued to deliver to her an eloquent exhortation to repentance and renunciation of the evil one, which closed with the exclamation: \"Wonder, unheard-of wonder, that the devil himself saves souls, and serves them as physician and surgeon!\" Magdalena, who might have seen collusion and deceit in this scene, remained unmoved; the bystanders prayed the Psalms for her, and this seemed to bend her hardened spirit. She burst into tears, and throwing herself down before the others, declared herself a perverse and wretched creature.\n\nNow the ice was broken, and the work of conversion proceeded on its course. Verin pursued it with great insistent eloquence; and one of the possessed laid to heart for the other everything that could possibly be helpful to snatch her from the power she had hitherto served and lead her back to heaven. When the priest offered the Eucharist to both possessed ones with the words: \"Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi!\", the spirit cried out from Magdalena: \"Well for you a lamb, for us a roaring lion!\" When the priest commanded him to adore his God, he replied: \"What, should I adore this God, this God should I adore? I will not do it, I shall never do it, in defiance of thee, O Christ; in mockery of thee, O Mary, and of thee, O Magdalena, who art mine!\" Verin now cried: \"Ha, wretch, accursed one, like me! Thou hast no power over Magdalena, who will take the Lord as her bridegroom.\" \"No,\" screamed the other, \"she is my bride, and I will prove it.\"\n\nSo the spirits quarreled with one another; but the one belonging to the neophyte always drew the shorter end, yet avenged itself on her by from time to time calling forth the most violent paroxysms: it threw her to the ground, stirred up the most furious convulsions in her, and made known to the whole world through her mouth her most secret sins, which only her confessors knew, and at night it plagued her with incubi. Meanwhile Verrin continued his instruction in the Christian doctrine; at every section confirming the truth of what was said with a solemn oath. He held before her how she had three times renounced her God, who now might yet have mercy on her soul: O Magdalena! if the stars of the firmament could express thanks, if the leaves of the trees could understand these words, if the stones of St.\u00a0Baume had a voice, they would all praise God for it; for your sins are many, like the sand on the sea. The hard heart of the sinner slowly softened; she had frequent relapses into impatience and despair; terrifying visions frightened her sorely; the demonically ecstatic girl did not cease, with great eloquence, to press upon her again and again. \\[Page 390\\]\n\nNow she confessed herself once more before all those present, who had come streaming together from far and wide, as a sinner worthy of hell; and she laid herself down before the church door, begging the passersby to trample her as the most wretched creature with their feet. She now gave the signs on her body, one of which proved visible upon examination; and during the exorcism a number of spirits went out from her, though this did not lift her obsession; just as with Louise, after the departure of the two lower ones, Verrin had remained behind. Her torments returned in between with renewed strength; she was lifted up high by the demon, she lost---especially when she wanted to go to confession---often her sight and hearing for several days; imagination and memory were often bound to her, her whole body sometimes swelled up; her eyes became like burning lamps, distortions ran over her face, and for 15 days Asmodeus defiled her every evening under the exorcism, by calling forth the most obscene movements in her, during which she always believed she saw Louis Gaufredi.\n\nDuring these proceedings, Verrin had testified several times: that it was Louis Gaufredi, at the church of the Accoules in Marseille, who had seduced Magdalena; that he had made her renounce her baptism and her share in paradise; that he had given her the demon, and possessed her handwriting. He had cried out like one in despair that the living God forced him to this testimony, and he swore: that everything he had said was true, and he had laid a solemn oath upon the altar sacrament thereon. The priests, who had been witnesses to this, had remembered the church precept: to warn the sinning brother three times, and therefore had him admonished three times.\n\nOnce it had happened orally through Brother Franciscus; then in writing through a more urgent letter, which they wrote to him as eyewitnesses and earwitnesses of the oath, and in which they promised him that if he came to St.\u00a0Baume and there converted himself in quiet; then his sins should remain hidden, as if he had laid them down in the confessional. In the third, they had urged the Capuchins in Marseille to send three of their own with the guardian, and to bring the final admonition in a second letter to him. But the Capuchins did not want to involve themselves in this matter without prior consultation with Father Michaelis; all the less so, since the demon from another possessed woman in Aix had said and sworn: that Gaufredi was no sorcerer, and that Magdalena was not afflicted by any malevolent spell.; which Verin immediately declared to be a cunning trick of Lucifer, and the spirit of Magdalena confirmed it.\n\nVerin, for his part, now allowed himself to be commanded by the exorcist to go himself to Marseille for the conversion of the sinner, and Louise felt that he departed from her like a wind; she truly remained free of him in his absence, however with the feeling of pain from the maleficium. Thus he went a second, third, and fourth time, always fruitlessly, and on that account broke forth into curses against him: because he surpassed all sorcerers in wickedness, therefore he was the head of all sabbaths. Cain and Judas were innocent in comparison to him, and the demons themselves were of the opinion that hell was not sufficient to punish him. He had abjured God and all angels and saints; now God made use of that to which he alone had not abjured, namely the demon, in order to convert him. The time of the last and worst heresy had come; all of France was already infected by it. \\[Page 391\\]\n\nMeanwhile, Gaufredy had nevertheless resolved to go to St.\u00a0Baume in the company of two Capuchins and Father Michaelis, and he arrived there on the evening of the 21st of December. It was decided to leave the exorcism of Louise to him, and Father Michaelis delegated his authority to him for that purpose. Verin began with a prayer in which he most urgently and heartily besought the Lord for grace for him; which moved the hearts of many, but did not please others, who believed that he should not be allowed to speak, and that he must be interrupted. But he continued and asked his exorcist Gaufredy: Is God almighty or not? The one questioned replied: This one is almighty. Then the other asked: Has the Church the power to command the demons? He answered: She has this power. Then he posed the third question: whether the demons could be compelled to tell the truth, and whether the oaths of the demons, sworn in all form and solemnity, were valid or not? He answered: They are valid, and God can compel the demon to tell the truth. Verin now said: Take good note of what he has admitted; but turning to him: Then exorcise me! It was done, and at the end Verin adjured him anew to renounce magic and to turn to God.\n\nHe then swore by the holy sacrament that all was true which he had said earlier, and Magdalena swore the same with a double oath. Then he said further that he must be guarded in St.\u00a0Baume. The imprudent one had now ensnared himself; but on the following morning, dissension broke out among the clergy, which had already stirred earlier. Father Michaelis and the Capuchins excluded Father Romillon and the Dominican father Franciscus Dompt from their council, and in the course of the day the latter was told: he was proud, disobedient, ambitious, and striving after vain glory, and in all this sought only himself. Others judged again: he was all too credulous; still others judged differently.\n\nLouise too was treated contemptuously, and Verin said that day to Father Romillon: she would follow another calling, and did not deserve this treatment. He also broke the silence imposed upon him against Father Michaelis. The Dominican father threw himself, in the presence of the other Capuchins, at the feet of Father Michaelis, and begged permission to return to his province, however not with complete humility: yet he wished to withdraw himself from the matter, because Father Michaelis would not listen to him, but rather to those who maintained: Verin must not be allowed to speak; Louise was not possessed, and the whole affair seemed more from the devil than from God. In this uncertainty they nevertheless continued; on the following evening Father Michaelis exorcised, Gaufredy renounced magic, and Verin said Amen. Later he cried: Adam, where art thou? Out of the depths call to God thy Lord, and he will hear thee!\n\nHe compared him, in the following days, when the struggle within him seemed to persist, to a man mortally ill who had lost his memory. He also said: the Antichrist had already been born, of a Jewess with an incubus; the magicians were his forerunners, and God wished to prepare His Church for the impending dangers. Meanwhile, Father Michaelis conducted tests with the two women, in order to convince himself and the councilors of the Parliament of Aix, who had taken cognizance of the matter, whether they were truly possessed. Berrin said on that occasion, when silence was imposed upon him: O Michaelis, God looses me, but you bind me. \\[Page 392\\]\n\nGaufridy meanwhile renounced his written pacts, but the spirits cried out: it was not earnest with him, and he was only playing the Pharisee; holy on the outside, full of filth within. He sharply rebuked the exorcists for demanding signs from him; he must indeed, as they said, be the Bridegroom of the Church, but she too must obey her Bridegroom, who had resolved to give her light through him; they, however, imposed silence upon him. When he caught sight of Gaufridy, he began to bark, like a dog in the presence of a wolf nearby, and announced to him: if within eight days his sincere conversion did not take place, he would be burned to ashes. They say Louise is bound in her imagination; but the earth would have to swallow her, and you would have to deliver her to the flames, if she were not possessed, and if she had not sworn those many oaths of her own accord.\n\nMeanwhile, he always refused to speak in a foreign tongue; God would not have it, he would give no signs; for if he sent an archangel in his invisible form, they would say: it is the devil; but if in his visible form, it would be said: it is a man. On the tenth of January, finally, some of the more prominent men of Marseille came to St.\u00a0Baume, in order to lead Gaufridy back to their city. Silence was imposed upon Verin, from the Dominican Al\u00e8s what he had written was violently taken away, and he himself was arrested for a few hours; everything stood against him, and wherever he turned he encountered mocking words, scorn, humiliation; and they even threatened to have everything that had happened declared null and void, as if undone, by the synod and the Bishop of Marseille! Upon closer investigation, however---which ensued because the Parliament had taken the matter into its own hands---one convinced oneself of the women's real possession, and the papers were returned.\n\nThus what had begun in 1610 at St.\u00a0Baume continued in 1613 in the Netherlands. There, in a newly founded Brigittine convent, the three nuns Francisca Bolline\u0219ia, Catharina Fourner, and Perona Imberta had fallen into obsession; and at the request of the bishop of the diocese, the provincial of the Dominicans had appointed the same Father Dompt as their exorcist, to whom a Minorite, Father F. Michaelis, was assigned as assistant. They betook themselves to the place; at first the spirits were rebellious, but in the end they were subdued, and unanimously testified to Maria of Sains as the originator of the malefice. When questioned, she denied everything; but when the spirit of one of them revealed that she bore the marks of the demon, she confessed and herself indicated the places of these marks. At first she had to be compelled to these confessions by exorcism, but soon she did so voluntarily. Besides the three, all the others in the convent likewise suffered various afflictions, and she had been the primary originator of all these evils; despite the extraordinary reputation for holiness in which she stood, suspicion had soon fallen upon her; she had been locked up, but at that time had confessed nothing. Now she revealed that she had brought it about through a double malefice, in order thereby to destroy the young foundation. \\[Page 393\\]\n\nShe confessed still countless other crimes of this sort; also how the exorcists had long since been well known to her, inasmuch as she had seen them in St.\u00a0Baume, whither her demon Astaroth had carried her. We have already mentioned earlier what statements this resolute woman, who recoiled from no atrocity, had made; and how she herself had not shrunk from maltreating the Heavenly ones. While she continued unceasingly to make new confessions concerning the demons who obsessed her, she visited, according to her account, the Sabbath without interruption; and she always brought new signs with her, which the investigation conducted each time confirmed. Among other things, she also began to speak of the Antichrist, in which the three other demons assisted her.

Many will cling to him when he makes himself known, and everything that is written about him in the Apocalypse will be fulfilled. What now happens secretly among the sorcerers will then happen openly; nothing will be impossible to him, and his own will therefore believe him omnipotent. His sign will be the form of a goat; pressed upon the forehead among the more noble, upon the hand among the lowly. On the Sabbath they bring him, in celebration of his birthday, their gifts just as in the Epiphany to the Lord, and pay him homage thereby, and the prince of the magicians celebrates the day with three masses. \\[Page 394\\]\n\nA half year before his birth, however, in the year 1609, a boy was born to Magdalena; begotten by Gaufridy, according to the opinion of most, so that he might become the forerunner of the Antichrist; his name is Adocucy: and more beautiful and lovable than he himself, he will be raised with him in the Orient. When the time has run its course, this one will rise up against the Church; more will believe in him than have believed in Christ; the Jews will see in him their Messiah; he will transplant all the torments of Hell to earth, and apply them against the Christians; all heresies long since extinguished will revive, and Rome will fall. In place of the destroyed churches he will build new synagogues for himself, and they will honor his image there as they do him himself, and sacrifice Christian children to him; but he will secretly worship Lucifer, who will be loosed in this time, in which all vices will count as virtues, and will be preached as such by the magicians. He will perform signs and wonders, raise the dead, heal the sick; his images will speak like living beings, but many martyrs will lose their lives in these times. To him as guardians and watchmen and companions, however, Maria de Sains has borne two boys, and the nun Simona two others; they are strong as Samson, powerful and noble above all others.\n\nThe Simona who is here in question, like Sains, born in the city of Lille, had entered with her into the local Brigitten Convent; her accomplice in all her schemes and intrigues, she had also accused herself of the same things simultaneously with her. Since she was still a novice, they had therefore taken away her habit for that reason; but during the year in which she was kept locked up in the bishop's prison, she had confessed nothing. She was then released at the urging of her superiors and relatives, and had gone to Valenciennes; where she hired herself out as a maid, and thereby kept her whereabouts completely hidden from everyone. A man from Lille had fallen in love with her there, and offered her his hand; she consented, but since she needed the consent of her superiors for it, he went to obtain it; with the prohibition, however, on her part, to reveal her whereabouts to anyone.\n\nBut he did not keep his secret to himself, it became known through the women; Father Domptius, who was very interested in questioning her likewise about these matters, brought about her arrest. On July 29, 1613, he came, accompanied by two commissioners assigned to him and Maria de Sains, to Valenciennes; where they visited the arrested woman, who, however, denied everything. Maria, meanwhile, insisted on her accusation; if this one were not a sorceress, there would be none in the world. She was confronted with her; but since she always persisted in her denial, they decided to call upon the possessed ones to speak. Simona, however, replied: they might come, she did not fear the devils. The possessed ones were called forth, and now the same play began as in St.\u00a0Baume: Tevtathan spoke through the person of Perona and Maria and sought to bring her to confession, also urging the commissioners to apply torture; but although the three possessed ones testified against her with one voice, she remained unshaken. \\[Page 395\\]\n\nMaria now indicated the locations of her marks with ink; she meanwhile kept crying out \"Ah\" and \"Woe!\" because she believed she was being examined; but when later actually probed, the indicated spots proved bloodless and insensible. When she objected: that when she herself had just examined one spot, blood had flowed, Maria, called in, said: \"Last night you received a mark on your hand in the synagogue\"; she indicated the spot, and it was found to be such. Great, eloquent apostrophes to the arrested woman now followed; but Simona was not moved by them. She said: she did not consider herself guilty of what they demanded of her; Maria replied, so it had been with her too, only when she had affirmed the questions had her memory returned. Simona answered: she would not say \"yes\" until she had true knowledge of what she was to affirm; all their speeches now appeared to her like dreams. Thereupon Maria: so it had often happened to her too; but the father had then asked her: whether her marks were likewise illusions? Maria tried many more means on her, confessing herself as the worst sinner; they brought Simona into a church and exorcised her at midnight, the hour of the Sabbath; the spirits joined in speaking, and swore vehemently; Simona remained unmoved.\n\nOn the following day Maria reported: the hour of the Sabbath had been shifted to three o'clock in the morning; both of them had been there, and Simona had brought three marks. They were found, exactly as she described, on the left arm. One of the possessed women now swore a solemn oath: that she was a sorceress, and now the same three questions were put to her as to Gaufridy. She affirmed all of them, yet maintained: the possessed one did not speak the truth regarding her, and finally said: she would no longer answer the spirits henceforth; when they had talked themselves out, they would fall silent of their own accord.\n\nThe demons now press upon the silent one, presenting to her: what God has done for her, how all the saints of heaven have interceded for her; how her hardness of heart, in thrusting away all this grace from herself, has infinitely heaped up the measure of her sins, and will finally, at the approaching downfall of the world, make her a child of perdition. This at last seemed to break her stubborn spirit, and she began to weep. All those present urged her on, she wept more violently; the Dominican placed the Sacrament upon her head, and still weeping she cried out: I will say no more, I say no more no!\n\nThe demon drew nearer to her and said: The eternal Father receives you, the Son pleads for you that he may receive you, all the saints unite their supplications. She, entirely dissolved in lamentations, said: I am a sorceress, truly I am such a one. The demon spoke through the mouth of the Perona: By this God who created the angels and cast us out, do you deny that I am Beelzebub, the prince of the demons, who has so often marked you? She replied: I know you, I say it with displeasure, God's power compels me to it. Now follow in sequence the confessions, during which the demons of the possessed assist her helpfully and refresh her memory; yet on the second day already, when asked if she persisted, she said: I dare not contradict, but if I agree, then everything seems to me like a dream; and it comes to me as if I were speaking lies. \\[Page 396\\]\n\nIn between, she herself gave signs on her body, confirmed the statements of the others regarding the manner of the Sabbath, regarding the birth of the Antichrist; she shared sermons that Beelzebub had delivered there; she censured the doctrines of Binsfeld with the saintly condemnations, and corrected the statements of this saint, whereby again the demons helped, and Simona and Maria sang Latin hymns of praise to the honor of God. Soon, however, Simona recanted everything that she had stated and confessed, point by point.\n\nIf one follows the course of all these strange events, one believes oneself transported into that Sibyl's cave: the Dominican carries the torch ahead, strangely the paths intertwine, everything seems fashioned below as it is fashioned above on the earth, the darkness lacks only the sun; column positions, bridges, towers, castles, human figures and animal shapes and palm canopies, all have formed themselves from the stalactite; all truth looks like lie, all lie like truth, for the inner confirming soul is not present.

When Mathurin Picard there, in the year 1642, had died a shameful death, he had, after appointing a successor of the same stamp, had himself buried in the church at the grating of the nuns' choir. Now nearly all the nuns of the community became possessed; so that they, from that point onward and into the fourth year, fell into a state of rage and demonic madness that completely robbed them of their freedom and the use of reason.

Reasonable provisions that he had taken for their protection had been the consequence of this visit; but Picard had known how to turn the repentant ones away again, and they had made a new donation to him. Now, after the death, a report was made once more, and he came a second time to gain insight into the matter. He found everything in the greatest uproar, the whole convent filled with screams, horror, and despair. He had exorcism applied, and all screamed that they saw Picard's cadaver in the chapel, borne by four demons, and now bore witness to his sorcery, to his appearance at the Sabbath; his body was the true bewitchment of the convent, and no healing was to be thought of until it had been removed.

The judgment was carried out, and she was locked in an underground prison. \\[Page 402\\]\n\nShe does not complain against the injustice of the judgment, although it was passed without really hearing her; but she does complain against the harshness, that in prison every other confessor than the bishop's penitentiary was denied her; against whom she had an invincible aversion. A dark despair therefore soon took hold of her, in her five years' long solitude. With a rusty knife that she had found there, she gave herself stabs in the arm, to hit the veins; then sought to cut her throat, and finally thrust it into her belly up to the handle, keeping it in the wound for four hours, and turning it from time to time. All else aside, she suffered from the wounds like from a cancerous ulcer that had attached itself to her breast.

This had inquired into the life and conduct of the nuns, heard the witnesses, and recognized the guilt of some and the innocence of the others. At the end of August 1646 the judgment was passed, whereby Picard, Boul\u00e9 and Bavent, convicted of sorcery, sacrilege, and other abominable crimes, were declared guilty of death. Picard was to be dragged on a hurdle and burned, Boul\u00e9 hanged and burned; Bavent was to be kept in custody until the decision of the investigation pending against Louise, a co-defendant. The first judgments were carried out, and the records now thrown into the flames along with them; but no further judgment on Bavent is to be found. The exorcisms had likewise been continued until the beginning of 1646, and had finally achieved the liberation.

The bishop died from the exertion and vexation.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with this story in Normandy, another highly remarkable event occurred in Loudun, a small town that separates the provinces of Touraine, Poitou, and Anjou from one another without ever having belonged to any of them. There, Urbain Grandier was the first pastor of the town at St.\u00a0Peter's, and moreover capitular at the foundation of the Holy Cross. He was one of those characters who, wherever they may be found, appear destined by nature to rule; for he combined great talent with an equal energy of will, and a rich vein of life dwelt in him within a tall stature. He was an outstanding preacher, knew how to express himself with grace and ease in social intercourse; a firm and penetrating spirit made itself known in all his utterances; thus he soon became a phenomenon in the little town. But he lacked the religious and ethical foundation upon which these gifts could develop. \\[Page 403\\]\n\nA great inclination toward lust had been given to him as an additional trait, and he soon allowed himself to be mastered by it. Sixty unimpeachable witnesses testified in his later trial to all the adulteries, incests, sacrileges, and other godless acts that he committed in his church, in the vicinity of the Sacrament, without distinction of time of day, at every hour and in every moment. In order to gloss over this licentiousness before his conscience, he wrote a treatise against celibacy, which was found among his papers along with various obscene poems under investigation. The old men whose daughters, and the men whose wives he dishonored, became furious against him; and he now turned the entire cutting sharpness of his character against them, instead of doing anything conciliatory.\n\nThe complaint of the injured parties was lodged with his bishop in Poitiers; he was arrested in connection with it, and by the judgment of the officialate on the third of January 1630 was interdicted for five years in the diocese, and forever in Loudun. He appealed to the archbishop of Bordeaux, who acquitted him; however, with the advice to exchange his benefices. But he instead made his entry into Loudun with a laurel branch in his hands; he pressed his hard-won right to the utmost point, held the cold point of mockery toward his enemies everywhere, and involved them one after another in quarrels and lawsuits of every kind. Thus he became the tyrant of the place, an object of fear and terror to the weak and of irreconcilable hatred to the strong.\n\nWhile the Catholics were thus averse to him in this way, and many did not attend his church, the Huguenots had taken hi"}, "Language Knowledge Demonstrated by Possessed Nuns in Loudun": {"start_char": 1312456, "end_char": 1314337, "pages": "406", "keywords": ["laubardemont commission in loudun", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "\nThe commissioner Laubardemont began by taking the depositions of the witnesses; among them also those who had previously been frightened away from their testimony.

Their entire lives were subjected to the sharpest scrutiny; never did the statements of 20 individuals conflict on a point.\n\nThree and a half months of continued exorcism had demonstrated with evidence that they were truly in a state of obsession, for they had shown all the signs that the Church requires to determine the judgment on it. With regard to the understanding of languages, M. de Launoy de Razilly, who had long resided in America, gave testimony that he had spoken with the possessed in the language of some native tribes of that country; that they had answered him quite appropriately, and had also revealed to him several things that had occurred there.

More than fifty doctors, one after another, declared in authentic verbal processes that what the possessed performed physically surpassed all the powers of nature.\n\nAt the command of the exorcists they went immediately, without their pulse changing in the slightest, into the most violent convulsions; the face became frightful to behold; the tongue protruded black, thick, hard, and covered with pustules from the mouth, without this hindering them in the least from speaking clearly. They supported themselves solely on their stomachs, placed the palms of their hands on the soles of their feet with their arms twisted or threw their heads back to their heels, and in this way ran quickly and much about.

In the case of the superior, the distance of one foot from the other in this position was seven feet, although she was only four feet tall.\n\nOn May 9, 1635, Monsieur, the brother of the king, came to Loudun to witness the events that were causing such a sensation throughout all of France. On the following day he went to the church of St.\u00a0Ursula, where Elisabeth Blanchard was to receive communion. She was possessed by six spirits, one of which, called Ashtaroth, soon stirred, and now, conjured by the exorcist, soon made her fall into convulsions: so that she, twitching and rolling about, crawled to the feet of the priest, who placed the holy Sacrament on her lips, at the same time commanding the demon: to undertake nothing irreverent against it, or even to moisten the host in any way. \\[Page 408\\]\n\nThe possessed woman was immediately thrown to the ground, bent backward three times so that she touched the ground with her feet and the tip of her nose; whereby it appeared as if she wanted to rub the host on the earth, as she came so close to it that only the thickness of the paper separated them.\n\nWhen the exorcist hindered the execution through his repeated prohibition, the demon raised the girl again and blew upon the host that was visible on his lips; it moved like a tree leaf in the breeze, oscillating between the lips. When the exorcist now adjured Beelzebub to ascend into her face, the throat swelled extraordinarily, became hard, and one felt a throbbing in it. Thus one of her spirits after the other was adjured to make itself visible, and each obeyed, distorting the face in a manner peculiar to it into something gruesome; whereby Astaroth, under the left armpit, produced a large swelling with violent throbbing, to the astonishment of the prince's body physician.\n\nHe then ascended, driven from there by the exorcist, into her face, and caused the host to fall onto the paten; where it was found, upon close examination by the exorcist's finger, entirely dry. The lips of the possessed were also in truth so parched that they peeled off, and the skin appeared entirely white. The exorcist now wiped her teeth with a cloth and brought the host to one of the upper row, where it, touching the jaw with only a part of its circumference, again hung there for a long time; despite the most violent shakings of the entire body, the strangest contortions of the mouth, and a violent blowing that the spirit produced. She was now commanded to swallow the forms, which happened immediately.\n\nThe exorcist now asked the body physician himself to examine the girl's mouth, to see whether the host was still present. He did so, by running his fingers along the gum to the throat, and thus convinced himself that nothing was present in the mouth. The girl was now allowed to drink water, and her mouth was examined again afterward. Upon the command that the exorcist now directed at Astaroth---to bring back the host---one saw it immediately thereafter on the tip of the tongue. The same test was repeated twice more.

He, for his part, denied everything, all the accusations made were lies or imaginings, and he had never engaged in magic. In doing so, he displayed the firmness of his character, and conducted himself throughout the course of the affair with cool blood and great composure and presence of mind. Since he denied the truth of the nuns' possession, he was called upon to conduct the exorcism himself. \\[Page 409\\]\n\nThe Bishop of Poitiers gave him permission and authority; he put on the stole, the possessed were brought into the choir of the church, and now a terrible scene began. He started the exorcism with Sister Catherine, the most ignorant of all, whom he adjured in Latin. But all the others were now seized at once, and began to howl and scream. Sister Clara was the loudest of all, and went at him; he therefore desisted from the former, and turned to her, who, however, without paying attention to him, spoke confused nonsense. The superior stepped in between, he now addressed her again, but had previously said: since she understood Latin, he would speak Greek to her. The response he received then was: Thou art cunning, for thou knowest full well that it is the first condition of the pact not to speak Greek; he had rightly replied: O pulchra illusio, egregia evasio!\n\nNow he was told: he should exorcise in Greek, but first write down what he intended to say. But the possessed ones fell anew into rage, raged and howled, suffered convulsions, accused him of sorcery, and offered to break his neck if it were permitted; but this, as was natural, the exorcists prevented. He himself remained calm and composed amid all the clamor, looked the possessed ones firmly in the eye, spoke of his innocence, and boldly requested only this: that they allow the demons to break his neck, or merely to make a mark on his forehead if he were truly guilty; yet none of the possessed might touch him in the process.\n\nThe exorcists brought the raging ones back to calm, and now a chafing dish was brought in to burn four documents of Grandier's that the possessed had submitted. This was done, but now the previous scene repeated itself with double the intensity; the confusion became indescribable, the screaming so piercing, the bearing so frightful, that the assembly---honoring the sanctity of the place---could pass for a true Sabbath. Grandier alone remained unshaken and expressed no astonishment, even though the raving ones threw all his sins in his face, which he in turn denied, renouncing Satan and declaring: that he was, in defiance of him, still a Christian, and more than that, a priest; at times he even joined with the assembled people in singing hymns. This continued, the fury against him increasing from time to time, and he would have been torn apart had the bystanders not prevented it and led him out of the church"}, "Devil's Marks on Grandier": {"start_char": 1329796, "end_char": 1330927, "pages": "411", "keywords": ["- de rais marshal of france"], "verbatim": "They had the choice: either to declare an entire convent, along with all who had taken part in the affair, as accomplices in a grievous, devilish deception; or to find guilty the one whose evil character they knew full well.

Before his execution, he was to be put to the torture in the usual manner, in order to discover his accomplices. But he utterly denied having any such; even in the midst of harsh torment he said only that he was no sorcerer, but otherwise he had in truth committed greater crimes than this.

The civil lieutenant Louis Chauvet had taken Grandier's side in the trial, especially in the beginning of the exorcisms, and one of the possessed had later accused him too of sorcery. Terror had now become his demon, and he fell into a state in which he was never again seen fully in his senses thereafter. The surgeon Mannoury, who had examined the accused for stigmatization with the probe, was once going home at night after his death, and suddenly recoiled: Ah, Grandier! what do you want from me?

Driven out from there by ecclesiastical means, it appeared anew on the face of the superior in all its hideousness, while the father on his side again found himself entirely free. \\[Page 413\\]\n\nThis repeated itself on one morning perhaps up to the eighth time; he was struck as if by an arrow, suddenly thrown to the ground, so that he cried out, and they had to touch him with the sacrament at the places where he felt the demon, in order to free him again. Concerning his inner state during this, the sufferer expressed himself in a very remarkable manner in a letter to his fellow order brother P. Dumesnil in Rennes, dated May 3, 1635. There he says among other things: I cannot explain to you what takes place in me during this time, and how this spirit unites itself with mine, without taking from my soul either its consciousness or its freedom; while it yet behaves like my other self, as if I had two souls, one of which is deprived of the use of its organs, and now, holding itself at a distance, looks on at the doings of the other.\n\nThe two spirits contend with each other on the same battlefield, the body, and the soul is as if divided, open in the one to hellish impressions, in the other surrendered to its own movements, or to such as come from God. In the same moment I feel a great peace under God's good pleasure, and at the same time I cannot comprehend the raging aversion against him, which calls forth a fury to separate me from him; to the astonishment of all who see it. At the same time great joy and gentleness come over me, and then again a sadness that manifests itself in complaints and in a screaming, as the demons induce it.\n\nI feel and fear the state of damnation, and sense that foreign soul which seems to me to be my own, pierced by despair as if with thorns; while the other, full of good trust, mocks such sensations, and in all freedom curses the one who calls them forth. In truth, I recognize that that cry which issues from my mouth arises equally from these two souls, and I am at a loss to decide whether it is joyfulness that forces it out, or the extraordinary rage that fills me. The trembling that seizes me when the holy Sacrament is brought near to me seems, as I sense, to have its origin just as much in the abhorrence of its proximity, which is unbearable to me, as in a heartfelt and gentle reverence, without my being able to decide or command that it is more the one or the other.\n\nIf I wish, at the urging of the one, to mark my mouth with the cross, the other pulls my arm back with great hatred, and makes me seize the finger with my teeth and bite it in rage. In such storms I always find prayer the easiest; while the body writhes on the ground, and the servants of the church speak to me as to a devil, and pronounce curses against me. I cannot describe to you the joy I feel in being a devil in such a manner; not through rebellion against God, but through the calamity which sincerely shows me the state into which sin has placed me: and as I apply the pronounced imprecations to myself, my soul can immerse itself in its own nothingness. \\[Page 414\\]\n\nWhen the other possessed see me in this state, it is a joy to observe how they rejoice, and how the demons make merry over me, saying: Physician, heal thyself now! Mount the pulpit, it would be fine to hear you preach after you have thus wallowed on the ground. --- My state is such that few entirely free actions remain to me. If I wish to speak, my tongue fails me; in the Mass I must suddenly stop; at the table I cannot bring the bite to my mouth; in confession all sins suddenly escape me, and I feel that the devil goes in and out of me as in his own house. When I wake, he is there; when I pray, he stirs my thoughts at will; when the heart begins to open itself to God, he fills it with rage; he lulls me to sleep when I would stay awake, and through the mouths of my possessed he publicly boasts: he is my master, against which I can raise no objection.\n\nThus two demons deal with me, one is Leviathan, the adversary of the Holy Spirit, and the operations of this false Paraclete are entirely the opposite of those of the true one; they produce a desolation that cannot be described; he is the chief of the band of all demons who here perform this strangest of all things, and we have here at once paradise and hell together, and the nuns 634 here are in one sense true Ursulas, in"}, "Long-Term Effects on Father Surin": {"start_char": 1342297, "end_char": 1342709, "pages": "414", "keywords": ["- roullier victim father testimony"], "verbatim": "ore highly intensified, the final seal of certainty.\n\nWhat finally happened to him in such a manner; what later for twelve more years did not leave him; what once in a paroxysm led him to jump out the window of his order's house, so that he broke a leg, and only later finally left him, so that he for a long time thereafter led a quiet, pious life; what befell the other two exorcists: all this shows us the dan"}, "Execution of Hicks Mother and Daughter for Devil Pact and Storm Raising": {"start_char": 1346283, "end_char": 1346428, "pages": "416", "keywords": ["execution of hicks mother and daughter for devil pact and storm raising"], "verbatim": " the answer was: We find her guilty thereof.

They understood: that everywhere it depends more on the improvement and instruction of the unfortunates than on the intervention of a bloody terrorism; which only incites the wild, rending beast in man to lust, in order to tear it to pieces. This is already evident in the manner in which Father Surin treated the obsessed in the convent of Loudun.\n\nHere he did not wield the sharpness of the sword, not even did he make frequent use of exorcism; for he understood: that above all he himself, with his person, must stand surety for those entrusted to him. He therefore first turned in persistent prayer to God and his saints, the Virgin at their head, that help might come to him from there; and he held himself, during the course of many years, unceasingly in this prayerful communion. And the spirits cried out in the possessed: that this was the way to torment them and bring them to ruin. Into the same communion he soon also drew the obsessed Johanna; and as she too learned to maintain herself persistently in it, one of her spirits was thereby alone, without exorcism, compelled to depart.\n\nHe further judged that the main reason for the connection of man with the demon lay in the sins and evil habits of the former; all the more so, the deeper these were rooted; thus that in the measure in which sin was more present in a soul, all the more the devil would take root in it and triumph. Therefore, one must above all strive to eradicate this main cause, and thereby weaken the powers of the demon. This was also acknowledged by the spirits, as they cried out again: We have no more than what the vices of men give us; if these are eradicated, then we must succumb and depart from here.\n\nHe therefore continually exercised Johanna in the struggle with these her evil inclinations of the corrupted nature; her progress therein was soon attested by the spirits, who threatened him because he was introducing a completely new method, and offered themselves to all obedience if only he would cease therewith; for it was the greatest misfortune for them on earth to possess a mortified person, whose slaves they would be, instead of ruling her in her evil inclinations. She still had four spirits, and Father Surin devised the plan to attack each in his own stronghold. The one who drove her to all pranks, and the other who drove her to all pleasures; both he subdued by instilling in her the spirit of a earnestly strict penitence. She slept therefore on the hard ground, scarcely made any fire, scourged herself three times a day most sharply, wore a cilice and a chain around her body, fasted almost always, abstained from all fruits that she loved, and also ate with it many things that seemed to burden her in her stomach weakness. \\[Page 432\\]\n\nThereupon he also attacked the other spirits, who had taken up position in the proud-anger part, and combated them with humility and patience. When she therefore boasted under the impulse of her spirits; then he had her thrown down by beggars, trampled with muddy feet, and struck on the mouth. He sent her to the sister cook with the request: to give her a discipline, which the latter then performed quite simply. He made her publicly ashamed, for which she always thanked him afterward, and begged him to tell every man all her sins that she had confessed to him in a general confession. As she could not obtain this from him, she herself confessed before her fellow sisters her greatest and most shameful sins, and also made a vow to become a lay sister.\n\nIn the same way he combated the natural laziness in her, kept watch over all her gestures, words, and works, killed off in them everything that he noted as wrong, proceeding in each from the principle that the improvement of souls is more a work of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and of prayer than of science. The spirits let their impatience and displeasure appear in the course of the whole procedure: that they were forced to remain in a place where no nourishment and no space was left for them. But the purpose was achieved as desired; the demons departed one after another, each marking the forehead or hand w"}}
