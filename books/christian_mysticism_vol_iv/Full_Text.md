Preface to the Fourth Volume
============================

As the foregoing sections of the fourth volume of the Mystik round off and conclude this part of the great edifice --- which, founded in the visible and tangible earth, carries that same tangibility over into the two invisible regions --- the work had therefore to be divided into three large departments. One comprises therein those very foundations laid safely and well‑fitted into earthly nature; and this part is the Physiology of Mysticism. The second is that part of the building which, upon this firm ground, rises into those regions which, in respect of root and origin, are indeed above the earth, but are yet in it insofar as they make themselves known and reveal themselves in earthly things; and this section will embrace the Theology of Mysticism, within the circuit of the militant Church. Finally the third part will sink into those regions which lie beneath earthly nature; and although grounded in Hell, yet, in rising, manifest and spread themselves upon the earth --- and here the Demonology of Mysticism will be expounded. The earlier volumes were devoted to the development of the first two; now the third too has found its own, so that this part of the building is closed, and we may set the bouquet on the height.

The work rises on the spot where until now the heap of shards of recent centuries had stood; just as, indeed, its model, the Cross, was raised upon the skull‑place of ancient times. The spot had seemed uncanny in these centuries; for spirits walked there that wandered in their affairs. Thus the site was designated by the police as the place where all filth should be deposited; and since the times produced much filth, and in the movement many pots were broken, the mass of what was brought in piled up mountain‑high; and people comforted themselves thus: the spirits would be well covered, and would lose the desire to stir under the weight. But spirits go through rock and through ruins; they were always on top, as the industrious carters brought more; the gravediggers could not succeed in banishing them by burial. Now in shards and rubble and rubbish the cornerstones cannot be laid durably. Therefore the place had to be cleansed beforehand, and when that was done, behold the whole foundation of the work stood revealed, already carried high above the earth; the diligent had only carted in the great quantity of rubbish because the fortress of enlightenment seemed too threatening. Rumour was set in circulation: there had once stood there counterfeit‑minting establishments which had to be buried. The inhabitants, who ought to have known better, permitted the fable and grew accustomed to approach the place only with caution, and fancied each night they still heard the hammer‑blows. The speaker of the present work, who has some respect for the scientific instinct of the schools of this age, but assigns nothing to their higher intentions and wholly rejects their truthfulness and credibility in such matters, was not deterred by this ban which learned timidity had laid upon the place; he fell upon it and began the work of clearing. Upon the found substructure he then continued to build; and, the stoutest hands of all times lending aid in the work, he in the course of a few years brought it to the point at which it now stands before the eye. Precisely the ill repute of the matter and the secret fear of spirits which surrounded the object kept the workmen from pressing forward. \[Page 2\]

Some would not look; others jeered at the folly of the treasure‑diggers; the third, the genuine workmen --- for they always go about in aprons and with the trowel --- cried: Let them dig, the uncritical ones, and, in the Roman‑Catholic sense, go in search of miracles; if they find none, they will rightly be laughed at; but if they do stumble on some, then they have only brought to light the proofs of the spuriousness of their Church! Thus the work proceeded publicly, undisturbed by the world; whereas the crush and crowding of the great market otherwise do not easily allow anything thorough to come to maturity, here the peace of God and the silence of solitude lingered: each matter could be treated with quiet composure, each could obtain its right, confused and led astray by no objection; and so the work gradually rose up to its ridge and now supports and protects itself, and let Nidhauger gnaw at its foundations in vain. For it is a bulwark of Catholicism which those who ought to defend it had abandoned and left to decay. Now it is newly fortified and well preserved; for it rests firm upon its rocky ground and can defy every attack.

As already said, the work is planned threefold: an earthly one, solid and well put together, each projection mutually securing the others; a supra‑earthly one, surveying and governing all; and an under‑earthly one, displaying its secret terrors beneath what is visible; the three covering, protecting, and corroborating one another. Three full, rounded, self‑contained disciplines --- indeed sciences --- are here established; each enjoys an actual foundation such as few others possess. With respect, first of all, to the physiology of mysticism, this foundation is similar to that which underlies the natural sciences. Here are the physicians and the naturalists who offer themselves as guarantors of the facts that belong to them; and if of the whole abundance of the natural riches only some things, and these not down to their innermost ground, are ascertained, this arises from the overarching, hard‑to‑access nature of the object, and induction here has at least the certainty of every medical science, and is daily strengthened by the advancing spiritualization of all physics.

The induction of hagiological mysticism appears incomparably better established. For the fact in question here springs from the soil of the most devout, God‑inspired, most blameless, most truth‑ful individuals; it is apprehended by them throughout in a penetrating, ethically purified and comprehensive spirit as far as possible; it is externally attested by witnesses who are in the most favorable position to discern it from the outside inward, even as they themselves are again discerned by it from the inside outward. They are therefore, as indeed by their vocation and position in general they are called to be, seekers after truth and proclaimers of truth. The ground of the attested --- the holiness of the individual producing the fact --- is further confirmed after that person's death in the miracles which he performs, and this guarantee is then certified by the authority of the Church, which thus likewise sanctions the innermost foundation of the attested truth. What other fact in the whole realm of science --- except perhaps the self‑consciousness guaranteed by the consciousness of God and of nature, which is the basis of all scientific certainty --- may be compared with the assurance of this historical fact? \[Page 3\]

In the demonology of mysticism this guarantee---the holiness of the one presenting the facts---indeed generally falls away; but in its place there now steps an ethical necessity which has just as firm a law as the physical one in natural phenomena, and thus affords to its products the same security as those. Error can in both cases lie only in the apprehension, and there again vouchsafe the same credible, practised witnesses who have borne testimony in the regions of that holy mysticism; and to these, strengthening their guarantee, are added the summoned physicians and the jurists. If, then, the certainty of this order of facts by no means attains that of the other, its guarantee nevertheless lies midway between that claimed by the physiologico‑mystical and that due to the hagiological. Thus matters stand with the facts in general; as to the particular selection made from the mass before us, we have already spoken concerning the first two disciplines; here we may only append to what has already been said the necessary remarks regarding the demonological.

First, as to possession: in order to bring the authenticity of the chosen examples---the ones valid in the higher domain---as close as possible, we have preferred those that occur frequently from the Gospels onward throughout the history of the saints. The atmosphere that surrounds a saint penetrates and overcomes the haze of falsehood and the darkness of the gloomy circle that has drawn itself around the possessed, and the same degree of certainty to which the whole life of the holy man lays claim extends likewise to this integrative moment of his. Secondly, those places where a remaining relic of such a saint--- a reliquary, for example---mediated intercourse with him, and where throngs of the afflicted gathered about such a site, have produced a rich practice in which a comparatively significant mass of facts has now accumulated.

We mention first the Camaldolese monastery of Valombrosa, half a day's journey from Florence. Saint Walbert, contemporary of Gregory VII and founder of the order, had there erected an oratory to the Blessed Virgin. In his life he had, when a dying monk was grievously terrified by a vision of a demon, driven it off with a cross which he took from the hand of the dying man. The monks preserved the cross there, and it soon served to test the possessed with it to determine whether they were truly demonic. Later the arm that had borne the crucifix to victory was also discovered; and from that time the Church of Our Lady at Valombrosa became a refuge for the possessed for all Tuscany; indeed, they came in swarms even as far as the borders of France. The healings increased, and since the year 1450 the occurrences had also found someone to record them in writing. \[Page 4\]

Responding to the urging of the physician Laurentius, who had been present on the spot, Hieronymus of Raggiolo, an active and very pious man, from what he there found, learned from credible old people, and saw with his own eyes, compiled eighteen books on the demonic healings. The confidence in which the holy place and its founder were held was so great that, as he reports in Book XVII, merely from the Getica region in Tuscany and the surrounding territories, every month---except in the depths of winter---three to four possessed persons, women and men, and people of every rank, came to seek deliverance; and hardly had they obtained it when they were again replaced by newcomers. The tomb of the holy Cajetanus in Naples was just as celebrated as he was helpful to those sick from the demon: hence he was visited even down to recent times by such persons, who filled everything around them with their howling and the lamentations of their oppressed spirits, and hung all the walls with stones, nails, tufts of hair and similar rubbish as trophies of the saint's victories. The relics of St. Ubaldus, who died in 1160, are buried in Gubbio, and from the hour of his death down to the most recent times the possessed were delivered at his grave; some even while they were climbing the mountain. The wondrous healings which there occurred up to the year 1519 have been written down by Stephen of Cremona, who also composed a book on the exorcism and personally practised it there, from his own eyewitness account and from what he heard from those present.

At the grave of Saint Leontius in Mur many were likewise freed; in Teinst in Belgium likewise at that of St. Amalberga, who died in 772; the Helfersberg in the Eichsfeld, where St. Boniface overthrew the image of Stuffo, and Charlemagne raised up the cross which Heizzo had borne in his battles against the Saxons, was likewise thereby famous in central Germany. At all these places a rich source of experience flowed; the temple annals show the holy malady in all its forms and aspects; and the only thing that can be objected to them is that they preserve merely the healings that occurred, and for the most part pass over in silence the cases of local incurability.

All these facts were attested by credible observers, but among them there is still a lack of such as have found this attestation also through the personality in which they manifested themselves. The mass of ordinary possessed persons is entangled by the predominance of a mendacious force; against it a single, but weakly self-assured personality reacts only feebly. To remedy this evil state, a hard-to-reconcile combination of holiness and possession had to be united in the same person; a combination which, precisely because of the inner contradiction, will occur only rarely. It is known that some of the ancient fathers in the desert were in such a way at once holy and possessed; but neither have they recorded reminiscences of their internal condition, nor have those who stood near them preserved any such records. \[Page 5\]

Among all the saints collected by the Bollandists the same is reported only of St. Eustochia in Padua; without, however, learning there any nearer circumstances concerning her. Bernardinus Seardonius, the canon there, spoke of her at greater length in his writing De antiquitate urbis Patavii (Basle, 1560), yet unsatisfactorily; and to learn more about her one must look about in her vitae, which on this side of the Alps are scarcely to be found anywhere. Her life, by Michael Aug\[?\], Abac\[?\], the Theatine, appeared in 1666; that by the Augustinian Giberti in Venice in 1672 and 1674; a third by Giuseppe Salio in the Venetian edition of 1739. Above all, good and beautiful, written in classical Italian, is the Vita, miracoli della beata Eustochia vergine padovana nata e professa dell'ordine benedettino nel monasterio di S. Prosdocimo di Padova, scritta dal P. Giulio Corr\[ado\] della Compagnia di Gesù. Rome, \[date illegible\]. Cesare has made an extract from it known in his Fiore di storia ecclesiastica (Turin, 1856). All these refer back to an earlier one by Baroccio, who was Bishop of Padua from 1488--1507, and finally all go back to a common source, the records of her confessor Saligario.

His contemporaries testify of him: Girolamo Saligario was a learned and devout priest of Padua, who not long after their death wrote the life of the departed in the form of an instruction for another nun, in a simple style. He was well informed about everything that occurred with her day by day; for she concealed nothing from him. All are unanimous that he was learned enough not to be easily deceived in matters of the spirit; sufficiently clever not to be taken in by appearances; possessed of adequate keenness to distinguish false virtue from true; and if no other testimony existed, his writing would speak for him. He declares that he has written with all truth and exactness, and he appeals each time to what he saw with his eyes and touched with his hands, mentioning only in passing other things that he had learned by hearsay. He knew, moreover, that he had unusual things to relate, and warns the nuns not to let themselves be led astray by them. (Italian:) "Di ciò non mi curo, perché io non parlo con increduli, né con eretici. Mi basta in questo la testimonianza della mia coscienza, et Dio sa, che in ciò, che scrivo non desidero che laude; ma la verità onorata, ed alle anime utilità." --- I care nothing for that, for I do not speak with unbelievers nor with heretics. The testimony of my conscience suffices me in this, and God knows that in what I write I desire neither praise nor glory, but the truth praised and the good of souls.

This manuscript was to be kept in the library of St. Prosdocimus in Padua, and consulting it there was one of the reasons that in the autumn of 1810 determined me to cross the Alps. But St. Prosdocimus had been suppressed under the French rule; the remains of the custodia had been taken to another female convent of the city; and it was possible that the books had been moved as well. But upon inquiry of the superior of the institution it turned out that none were there; and as to what had become of them for the fourth volume no information could be given. With further inquiry the cathedral library was indicated as the place to which the books had been delivered; and soon there everything that could possibly be found was put before the inquirer with friendly willingness. The following manuscripts were among them:

I: A parchment volume in small quarto from the year 1465 (8 Kal. Jun.), written in old Italian, under the title: Jesus Maria. Hieronimus s. P. Presbyter ad Eustochium monialem reclusam et ad ceteras sorores. In the beginning it says: "Dilecta filia, in me ha domandato et tu desidero de intendere alguna cosa utile del giudicio finale." --- "Beloved daughter, you have asked me and you desire to understand something useful about the final judgment." This desire, he then continues, is just, and in no way should its fulfilment be refused, and he cites in this matter the judgment of St. Bernard. He then proceeds in the first part to the workings of the malignant spirits, setting forth the experiences and thoughts of St. Anthony about them; he then expatiates on the diversi inganni del Demonio --- the various deceits of the Devil --- further on le arme de' Demoni --- the weapons of the Demons --- and on the weapons of prayer against demonic apparitions. Then he treats of the angels and the good spirits and their helpful activity. The second section then speaks at length of the Last Judgment, of Gog and Magog, of the Antichrist and the other apocalyptic apparatus. The third deals with the manner in which one should humble oneself before God's judgment in life, and with patience accept what He has decreed. The writing, although it does not further mention the Custodia by name, was evidently occasioned by her. She had died shortly before, and her fate had awakened much reflection in the convent; and the nuns could hardly understand how it had come about that so innocent, pure, indeed holy a person could be subject to such harsh dispensations; and the confessor of the convent now endeavours to explain the matter to them. The book is written in the plain language of the time, and one readily recognizes from it that the above-cited judgment of his contemporaries about its author was completely justified. At the end several leaves are torn away. \[Page 6\]

II: A parchment manuscript in another hand, in octavo, treating the temptations and how they are very useful and necessary for the salvation of man; again addressed to Eustochio and the nuns; often referring to her life but not relating it, and likewise defective at the end.

III: A third volume, continuing the same subject from the temptation, completing the begun theodicy, and also frequently referring to the Book of Job. It is a thick quarto volume, written on paper, addressed to the sisters Scholastica and Veronica, and at the end marked "1401 XIV. Calend. Novembr."; therefore, as perhaps also II, not by Saligario, who at that time was hardly still alive. Finally a fourth volume in folio on parchment, the Miracles of the blessed Eustochia, as they occur daily at her grave, containing the years 1472--1487, and authenticated with a notarial signature. Although Eustochia had given occasion for all these books; and although they more than once allude to her and to the life written about her, that life itself is not among them.

Now, since further investigation proved fruitless, and the condition of the manuscripts still extant, and the partial destruction they had suffered, could only have arisen from the vandalism to which they had been exposed at the suppression of the monastery, the obvious conclusion suggested itself: that this violence had not been content with a part of the thing sought, but had destroyed it altogether, and thereby cut off every further inquiry. Such were the circumstances when the reporter went over to Venice on other business. Soon the librarian of the seminary of Padua, H. Valentinelli --- whose helpful kindness in everything he must gratefully praise in the highest terms --- wrote to him: a copy of the manuscript in question had since been found in the episcopal chancery together with other related papers; and these had been opened, by higher permission, to the returning researcher. It was clear, since the bishops at various times had pursued her canonization, that these manuscripts had then, when the necessary apparatus was assembled, been deposited in the episcopal archive. On arriving on the spot His Episcopal Grace readily and obligingly opened access, and there was first found the hitherto thought‑lost life by Baroccio under the title: Vita della beata Eustochio composto in latino per il molto Rev. Padre Monsignor Pietro Baroccio, vescovo paduano et tradotta in volgare da Daniele Villa Doctorlegista Pad., et scritta di mia propria mano ad istanza della ven. Abadessa del Monast. de scto Prosdocimo, nel Anno 1541. 5. Apr. --- in six closely and very illegibly written quarto leaves; and another somewhat differing recension in seven folio leaves, again ascribed to Barozzo "homo dottissimo et de santa vita." Beside these was found: Catalogo de memorie antiche et moderne manuscr. et a stampa int. alla b. Eustochio nel Monasterio de S. Prosdocimo; and in it were entered all the manuscripts that we above recorded as being in the cathedral library, with the note that between Nos. 1 and 11 in this catalogue there had been included an octavo‑format one no longer extant, by the same author Girolamo Saligario, in which the life and precious death of Blessed Eustochio are dealt with. That manuscript was therefore lost; but of it there was, besides an instruction for the canonization process, an opinion by the Jesuit Butta Fanre on the subject, and the correspondence that had already been exchanged, a copy in small folio on paper in two parts under the title: Memorie della b. Eustochio paduana, scritte da Girolamo Saligario Sacerd. Pad. Confess. \[Page 7\]

This copy was taken faithfully from the ancient original manuscript that was preserved in the archive of the monastery of St. Prosdocimus. It is in the old Paduan dialect, which itself is sometimes difficult even for the present inhabitants to understand, but is otherwise written legibly; and at the end of the second part, which---weaker than the first---contains only 34 pages, the following note is entered: In fine del manoscritto leggesi 1477 septimo Idus Decembris; and a little lower: questo libro e del monasterio de s. Prosdoc. Padoa, 1418. One sees that Baroccio, the contemporary of the author, had already drawn from it, and later biographers have adhered to it. Only a few facts, which were nevertheless of the greatest importance for mysticism, they had overlooked. These were immediately extracted and are taken up further below in their proper place, in the third (and for the fourth) volume.

Thus the authenticity of the facts in the history of the possessions was pretty well provided for; it remained at once to procure equally reliable material for the matters of witchcraft and sorcery. Whoever has looked about even somewhat in this field knows how the matter stands throughout with respect to the experiential basis. Current literature is by no means lacking in such material; but it is as if the rabble itself, in cat form, had fallen upon it and roughed it up and thus entangled it so that no one is able to disentangle the snarled ball. Fabulous, legendary, natural and demonic elements run together in German matters in such a way that no one is able to separate them; the accounts may be true, but nothing has been done to demonstrate this truth externally. Even the records of the witch trials yield little; because of the slovenliness of the whole procedure---mostly only the back-and-forth talk of the excited populace, in part reporting oddities that are nowhere pursued and sifted thoroughly; then the unreliable confessions of those terrified to death on the rack, one miserable creature taking from the mouth of another; and so the same monotonous chatter repeats itself and leads to no result.

Not of much greater value are the contributions that England supplies us in this matter; there the entire form of process was directed to determining the persuasion of the jurors, which, being assumed in advance, did not require deeper probing. It was different, however, in France. That people---predominantly a measuring, counting and weighing people of understanding---has always directed a particular attention to form in all things, and has brought it everywhere to importance. The higher courts, the parliaments, have taken those processes in hand; they have never lacked wise, sensible, humane jurists, backed by the tradition of a legal experience of centuries; carelessness has not easily found its way into their sessions, and they have left no means untried to shed light on so complicated a matter and to motivate their judgments.

The clergy there have indeed allowed credence to the ground of the matter, but that very national spirit did not permit them to surrender to it blindly, shutting themselves against every objection of skepticism. Therefore they have at all times, with the same sobriety of mind which the national spirit now brings to the physical sciences, observed and experimented on the subject with the same keenness of intellect as is now customary, and have then deposited the results in authentic form. The physicians, too, have not lagged behind; one perceives throughout how doubt and the evidence of the senses contended in them, and how they at last recorded the findings conscientiously and in the best form. So we are thus offered here a material that has gone through a threefold examination by fully authorized and --- each in his own sphere --- distinguished observers, and under the stamp of these wardens has acquired complete credibility and guarantee. The inclination that moreover has always existed among this people to set down memorials about the lives of individuals has prompted several who were involved in the matter to leave us such writings of repentance or of renunciation; without doubt they are to be counted among first‑order documentary pieces, because they proceed from the most concerned and best‑informed. From there, then, we have consistently taken the facts that form the basis of this second part; they will speak for themselves, and if they err, they err in that error which clings to all human knowledge, and which even the threefold control is unable to separate.

A subject of this kind already contains in itself the impulse to arrange itself into determinate forms; as the elements of water in still air of their own accord unite into the snowflake. It is induction, namely, that seizes them, and according to a definite formal law of elective affinity joins them into a whole; a schematism which shows itself arranged, as it were, in radiations and sub‑radiations. The next question is: according to which formal law will this schematism be structured? Without doubt according to the same in which the human personality is held. For all these facts have appeared with reference to the human personality; it is the ground from which they have grown; all of them together, considered as a complex, are found bound up in it, in a regularity that governs all its manifestations. Since it itself appears divided into body and soul, and is again united in a third out of both into unity, and since this same basic structure repeats itself in all things subordinated to it; the law in which they are all connected with one another will likewise bind the facts that have sprung from them into a natural system. Thus induction in this book has proceeded through the domains of all three sciences. In the first volume it physiologically established the natural schematism of the human personality, and then carried this through the two other domains. Around it the formative impulse in the facts immediately began its play; a busy rushing about and confusion forthwith arose; for each one, unbidden, sought its place, and only after it had found the right place did it rest in it. Nothing artificial was done beforehand to prepare and insert them; they arranged themselves of their own accord, and now confirm and defend one another. In parallel fashion, in three domains the same play repeated itself; above it was only the brightly shining ethical and supra‑ethical light that prevailed, below the darkly shining sub‑ethical light; while in the middle the natural light to which these efflorescences refer. All three mutually reinforce one another, and only after formation succeeded above did it become possible to disentangle the amorphous error and confusion of the lower, and likewise to order them and circumscribe them with determinate lines. Thus the three circles --- the physical, the metaphysical, and the hypophysic (hypophysical) --- are rounded and well closed, and the three formal sciences native to them bear witness to one another; and now that each has found its place within them, it testifies also for itself and for its whole surroundings, and is in turn attested by them. In the whole extent of what has thus been ordered there is nothing that a sensible man ought to be ashamed to believe; yet a diligent closing of oneself against the evidence of truth, and the rejection of the guarantee of unimpeachable witnesses, would be a most shameful stubbornness. to the fourth volume.

The induction, having reached this point, nevertheless first encounters a new task which it must solve if it is to be completed otherwise. Order and its lawfulness, and in part observation itself, have hitherto been purely formal in character, and they therefore point back to an inner, substantive being that underlies them, and which must first be found, and from which the formal must first be derived and developed, before science can then fulfil itself. This substantial ground in all things is now of the nature of unity, which unfolds itself in the multiplicity of forms in every direction; in a law which, of mixed character---substantial and formal---appears bound in a third respect. These unities in the sciences must first of all be sought, and at the same time the laws of unfolding that inhere in them. In physiology the unity is the unity of nature, and the law the organic, in which life is contained. In hagiology the unity is God, and the law the norm in which he reveals himself to man in the realm of grace. In demonology the unity is sheltered in the personality of root‑evil, and the law of this unity makes itself known in the modality in which it manifests itself in the realm of the curse. To the previous analysis, therefore, a synthesis is now appended, and this is in the first circle indeed of a philosophical kind, but in the other two wholly theological. It cannot be avoided; for the analysis must precisely in it find the unity to which it belongs, so that it may be carried through; and this unity cannot justly unfold itself in relation to the given multiplicity, and thus complete the synthesis, without finding indicated in the analysis the focal points of its opening directions; so that both presuppose one another, and one becomes the control of the other. \[Page 8\]

If, therefore, in formal science it has been observation and the scientific mind that have guided induction, it is now---at least in two of the three circles---dogma and the Church that take over guidance and judgment in the synthesis. The Church has always been the great mistress of every synthesis; a work such as this remains at all times subject to her, so that she may examine whether the synthetic spirit at work in it has proceeded with care and rightly; and so great is the respect its author has acquired for that spirit of hers that, even if her judgment should not immediately appear convincing to him, he would nevertheless feel determined to assent to it without hesitation. The analysis in the book, however, stands or falls with this synthesis. A fourth discipline is still lacking to complete the whole scientific organism. In the first three it is the Logos made man who stands as the highest unity: first over physiology, as he by whose likeness nature was fashioned; over hagiology, as he in whom the divine and the human natures are united, and who now, assimilating to himself the personality of the holy one analogous to his humanity, draws it to himself and appropriates it; finally over demonology, as the power which fashioned the nature of the demon in its in‑itself good being, and even to that which is evil as the result of its perversion sets its bounds, limiting it in its inner, albeit abnormal, lawfulness (limited to the fourth volume), and permits and tolerates the connections of the same with mixed natures, and at will divides and separates them.

Beyond this unity, however, there lies still a higher one, that of the Trinity, into which the Logos himself enters as a moment, in the divine being. For it the whole creation has only the significance of a divine thought; hell hides in the abyss of its own being, and heaven has meaning only because it most perfectly expresses that thought. Demonology is thus here wholly bound and overcome by hagiology; and a higher physiology occupies it in divine physis. Through the Logos this higher unity is opened to the human spirit from afar and the way to it shown; and in it the analytical and the synthetic movements of thought likewise coalesce into one. This fourth, highest mystic therefore stands above the three others; she is in the One, the Second is about her, the Third is deep beneath her. She thus stands in secluded solitude for herself; the best of the Others touches only her outermost rim, and she is already in them through the Logos. The three therefore form a closed whole for themselves, and she again likewise, and yet again by no means entirely withdraws from those three. Therefore, now that the trilogy has come to its close, we regard the work as rounded and complete in itself, and we shall---after other necessary preliminary labours are ended, when it is granted us to return to the subject--- endeavour, following also the traces of that Higher, to apprehend them likewise in a comprehensive conception. In the meantime we hold the work closed and finished with the three disciplines: the other, its most general fundamentals, already contained in the introduction to Suso, could on the basis of that triad easily also have been completed by another, and even in recent times there has not been a lack of, in part, estimable preliminary studies. The completed work now submits itself to judgment, eluding no competent person, but closing itself to the weak-minded and prejudiced, and growing and prospering in the life that dwells in it.

Book IX. The Witch and Magic-Being
==================================

Section I. Transitions from Involuntary Possession to the Voluntary Attaching Oneself to the Evil
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[Page 9\]

The possessed person is for the most part, against his will and contrary to his intention, brought into intimate fellowship with the principle of evil that has produced his condition; and his endeavour is directed to the tearing asunder, as soon as possible, of the bond which mediates this intercourse. But just as in all that is human a twofold aspect of its being emerges---one in which he may be had, while in the other he has and seizes---so this doubleness will prove itself here also. If the boundless state of possession by a tyrannical power is also contrary to the individual will, and painful through its torments, the thought of self-possession and of intimacy with a power that now apparently honors the master and obeys him, while turning its baneful effect against others, flatters him on the other hand. Such a relation is therefore the reverse side of the other; and while the latter is formed by a sudden inroad, violent as a robbery, the former permits a free conclusion: the one who concludes, with a certain composure, yields himself to the intoxication, and now, after he has made an act of subjection, demands back from the power to which he has surrendered the surrendered thing, increased with usurious interest. The beginnings of such a relation are sometimes already to be found in the very tumult of a possession. \[Page 10\]

It has indeed sometimes happened that the possessed, either already by their own evil disposition or wearied by the torments they must endure, become in all things willing to the spirit that dwells in them and tyrannically masters them, and obey it; whereby the torment indeed ceases, but the consenting ones at once become companions and assistants in the commission of many misdeeds. Moreover, a variety of circumstances that occur in possessions point into a region where things that here proceed under the form of will‑less necessity were brought about by deliberate consideration; so that it gains the appearance as if possession itself were either the artificial work of deliberate contrivance, or at least, both in its origin and in its course, continued in a certain relation with the masters of the art.

Thus Peter Bernardi of Areia was violently possessed; he bit at noses and ears, and howled so that the hills and mountains around Valombrosa rang again. When the exorcism was applied, his spirit began to speak and recounted how he, bound by a charm, could not free himself until that charm placed under his threshold was removed. The monks, however, attached no credence to these words and continued with the invocation. The possessed then became entirely furious, and with a wild, burning eye cried out: "O cross! O torment! what must I endure; for what, you villains, all the praying, and the singing and toil! You well know what I said before." Some of those who had brought him into the monastery thought now that one must remove whatever might be found there; the monks, however, prevented anyone from proceeding to the work, so that it should not appear as if they had credited the devil, or that he had only departed after the removal of the charm. They therefore continued calmly and unconcerned with the exorcism; but he now tore himself away from the hands of those holding him, was thrown to the ground by the demon, and tormented as never before. This continued for a while; at last the demon, exhausted and unable to resist further, departed.

But it was worth the trouble, says Hieronymus, to hear what voices he uttered, even afterwards wandering about in the sanctuary; it would have seemed incredible to me were it not for the credible persons who, as eyewitnesses, gave me an account of everything. Such a clamor and tumult and trembling accompanied the departure that one thought the church and monastery were coming to ruin. Having returned to Florence, the people, disregarding the prohibition in the monastery, searched what lay beneath the threshold, and found a bundled, silk‑thread‑bound cloth, and in it a piece of the bone of a dead child, a woman's hair, the skin of a donkey's hide, with certain signs and characters written on it, all of which they immediately gave to the fire.

One sees that the ancient idea of magic and counter‑magic underlies this report. What the fingers of the dactyls, brooding mischief, had bound to the left side, the fingers of the right again loosened, preparing good fortune, and thus good and ill kept equal balance. So here it was words, formulas, and the relics of a child that had bound the possession; but the power of fire was to unravel the knotted thing as a counter‑charm. The Church, rightly, has not adopted this doctrine; she has not wished to regard the exorcism and her aid as merely a counterpart to witchcraft, lying on the same level with it; but rather as the higher thing, lying above magic and counter‑magic, because rooted in God; and in advancing unerringly along the appointed path she has broken the one and rendered the other unnecessary.

Similar things have at times occurred in other cases. A woman from Calcia was possessed on the eve of the Feast of Our Lady of the Snows. They took the sufferer to Valombrosa, and Hieronymus of Raggiolo himself exorcised her there; but her demon remained silent for a long time. Then a stranger monk, well versed in necromancy, happened to come by and begged to be allowed to speak something into the mouth (ear) of the possessed woman. He was permitted, and he delivered his speech. Immediately the demon looked at him threateningly and burst out with the words: "Hypocrite and flatterer, not a brother, but a corrupter! How dare you in this holy place, with evil art, force him whom God has not yet forced? You would rue it on the spot, if what you bear on your breast were your work." The monk answered: "I do not fear your threats!" The demon then formally challenged him, and the challenge ran to the Alps or elsewhere, wherever it pleased him; "you will not reach Perusium without having felt my power!" When the monk on his journey had come to the Perusinian lake, he sat down, weary, beneath an olive tree on the bank of the water. In a short while a black vapor and smoke rose from the waves, wrapped him completely in night and shape, and then lifted itself into the air. The monk died, probably of fright, in Perusium. (The word he had spoken into the woman's ear was probably the formula: Exi daemon quia Ephimolei tibi praecipiunt!) For, according to necromantic tradition, these words have the power, in distinguishing possession from falling sickness, to act healingly upon it. If the possessed person falls, having heard the formula, and drops senseless, but after some time rises again and relates what has just happened --- proclaiming things true and unknown --- then he ought to be freed; but if nothing of the kind occurs, then it is the falling sickness that is afflicting him. That, then, was the counter-charm the monk had probably intended to use, the application of which, however, turned out so badly for him because the demon did not acknowledge the power of the forces by which he sought to subdue it. \[Page 11\]

At other times it has been amulets to which the spell was tied, even if only in the belief of the bound person; after their removal the release then proceeded more easily. An old woman who was brought to Valombrosa was there severely tormented; at times, however, she would break out into jest and laughter, during which she would then recite the Creed and other chants, in the manner of priests not badly sang. At last the sorely pressed demon cries out from her: If what she hides beneath her dress is not taken away, I cannot go out. It is found, and all the monks saw it with their eyes; it was an amulet marked with various signs, letters and words in the corners, set in wax and bound about with ribbons. Among the words were also Gog and Magog, the Tetragrammaton, Adonai and Sabaoth. It was burned, and the demon came forth with a great noise. It was not Gog and Magog that held him bound; but in all probability it was her intention, which the woman, in the agitation of all her powers, had directed to it, and which now formed the knot by which she remained continually entangled and connected with her malady and its originator.

Again, too, the statements of the spirit compelled to speak sometimes concern connections that he had had with third parties, in the wake of which his relation to the possessed person has arisen; statements to which, of course, no more weight is to be given than the deponent deserves. Thus a girl from Città di Castello becomes possessed. At times she is perfectly quiet and calm, at other times she wants to kill herself with a sword, and she attacks others with nails and teeth. The demon, when questioned, finally declares: a priest had conceived love for the girl; but because she did not heed his importunities, he had conjured him to win the refractory one for him. But since even these arts wrought nothing, he, enraged, entered into her; yet he held her very well, so that he even himself went with her to church. Pressed to the attack, he demands that the priest who had bound him should first also loose him again. When his demand is refused, he at last departs.

Therefore the attempt at such sorcery itself is sometimes punished with possession. So it befell a woman who had yielded to the sorcery and was now brought possessed to St. Gandolph. The spirit, questioned, says: I am the demon, and by the evil art of this wretch conjured, I entered into her. So then, replies the priest, amid teeth‑gnashing, foaming and terrible voices, come forth again! The people await the result, and everything happens as he said.

Through these intimations, then, we are transported into a quite new field. In the foregoing domain the objective had everywhere become predominant; a gloomy power had, with tyrannical force, taken possession of man and made him, without his being able to resist, its slave. It had therefore seized him at that side of his being where he himself also grounds his objectivity; at that root of his existence which reaches into the multiplicity of existing things, whether spiritual or material, and through which he, as a member of the created whole, is incorporated into its totality, shares in its movements, lives in its life, co‑acts in its actions, and has his thoughts thought along and woven into the larger strokes and circuits of the world‑forces. This side is therefore, in its lower element, the life‑circle turned outward in two directions; this part has a share in the flowing source of all life; it is the complex of his deeper instincts, to which external activities and stimulations correspond. It is then the direction of his sphere of will, which, tending outward and downward, takes determinations from there, and conforms itself to the law and rhythm of necessity in order to find in the ever‑same a counter‑support on which it can exercise its higher autonomy. \[Page 12\]

At last there emerges that mode of thinking which, being bound to what is given, finds itself moved spiritually, like the atmosphere by the regular currents of the year, and the heat poured out into space by the contacts of light; and which in its turn again gives the spirit a firm, secure foundation that it is able to grasp and determine. This kind of possible grasping through all domains belongs to the natural constitution of man; it is that which is Nature in him itself, the one, together with his being, as a personality formed of two united into one, coherent side of his existence. \[Page 13\]

But when into this natural ground the ground of root-like Evil has entered, and this, behaving as Nature, in its own way has laid hold of this side of the human being, and in its own manner has nullified all regularity of the natural by boundless arbitrariness and distorted it to extremes, therefrom possession has arisen. The seizure of possession, however, has taken place in the ganglionic system, and indeed in that half of it which is turned away from the indwelling spirit, is more open to objective influences, and therefore carries the rhythm of life, regulated by the pulse of Nature, into all the stirrings of the inner life. We have followed and expounded the metamorphoses of Evil, which arose through the intrusion of Evil into intercourse with Nature, in earlier \[writings\] in their whole development. But now the other side of existence, the subjective, presents itself to our consideration --- that side in which man is himself in the midst of the flowing course of things; a particular concrete personality, endowed with freedom, and with consciousness mastering itself and, to a certain degree, also the outward. That outward side could be subdued and conquered; the evil principle could, if it is permitted, dwell in it as in its own property; the other side, however, which is surrounded by it, remained unconquerable --- it could not, because sheltered in God, be taken away by the Evil and destroyed. Only when the free assent of the Lord and Ruler has been given will it likewise be opened and made accessible to the approaching one. This assent must take place in the innermost centre of spiritual self-revelation; there where the self‑proper, from above strengthened intellectual light first illuminates for him the ways and the roads which natural necessity has made, and which the Evil has now opened to him even down into the abyss. The deed must then execute what the guiding reason has decided; so that the decision may gain real, plastic existence in life, and thereby become actual.

On this side of the demonic reciprocal relation between man and the primal ground of evil, therefore, there can be no question of any conquest and overpowering of the former by the latter; only of a deception and a covenant in its train can there be talk. Man must freely give himself over to the principle of Evil, and himself open the ways for it, so that it may penetrate to the innermost secret of his will and of his guiding powers of wisdom. He must thus come out to meet it from within, and seek the paths on which he, breaking through the enclosure that surrounds him, can reach the companion whose fellowship he desires. All mystical intercourse with objective powers, however, can occur only through the lower nature, withdrawn from clear consciousness, thus through the ganglionic system. In the fullness of possession the evil principle had, along the paths that lead from this system into the whole of Nature --- along the path of perdition --- entered into it, and life found itself entwined by it. But now the inner, free man comes toward him with full consciousness; he himself opens to him the gates of entrance, so that he may rule not only over the nature in him, but also over the inner, free, spiritual will. This opening could only happen from within, along those ways which lead from the determining, free man into the unfreely determined; those ways which the spirit, for example, must furnish in its mastery of the affections and passions, in the regulation of all involuntary movements, and in the disciplining of all that is only given in thought. The border-forts between the inner and the outer man therefore had to be opened first, and from them then also those which are erected as boundary-keepers of the outer against nature; only then could the admitted one take his triumphant entrance, and he is then the lord of him who has voluntarily given himself up to him as a subject on the condition that he receives back from the recipient, strengthened in might and force by the power of the bond, everything which he has delivered to him. Upon the conditions of the pact now rests the whole magic- and witchcraft-world in all its reality and its manifestations --- the counterpart of possession --- which we must now make the object of our closer investigation.

In the discussion of this object, with which the present book is filled, the manner in which the admission is effected will first be presented to the mind, and the sort by which the ways are prepared and the paths smoothed on which the hostile principle makes its entry, as well as the preliminaries that precede the homage. That will be the subject of the first section. If the subjugation has taken place, a new citizen is thereby settled in the realm of evil and has there obtained the indigenate; then the new relation develops peculiar connections throughout all regions of existence. For the admitted one has now stepped out of the ordinary order of nature, and has subordinated himself as a member to a supernatural one. There, in the realm of evil, his intercourse with his surroundings has become different, and he must conform himself to the changed relations and thus seek to find his way in the new environment. His whole being therefore undergoes a thorough alteration through all the moments of existence, and these changes we shall have to follow in the second division. But once full appropriation has taken place, the elective affinities to the like and the repulsions of the unlike have at the same time formed; for one and the same bond entwines the citizens of the same state, and separates them from the participants of other associations. Beside the hostile relation to the Church there therefore now exists also another, a certain concordance with the realm of the possessed, which in its relation of neighbouring places stands to the actual central realm of evil. Through this mutual situation and relation certain transitional bonds and communities are formed between the two, in which they mutually complete one another, and may first form a truly closed whole. These unions and separations of the two realms likewise deserve closer attention, and they shall be the subject of the third division of this book. Finally, the relation of this realm to Church and State --- what both have done to diminish and dissolve the hostile realm by strengthening and increasing themselves; how both have grasped and treated the whole phenomenon --- form the matter of a separate consideration, and the fourth division will deal with this.

### Chapter 1. First Origins of Demonic Sorcery

\[Page 14\]

In the craft of sorcery the reverse side of the mystical relation in which the saints stand to the Church and its founder is expressed. The first step toward holiness is the complete surrender of one's being to that Good which is lifted far above nature, and can therefore seize and fill nature precisely at its innermost and deepest point. With his whole nature thus turned toward It, the would‑be saint surrenders the free as well as the bound man within him: all the powers over which he can freely dispose, as well as those that in part have a hold on him, he gives up to the object of his affection; and that object will accept the offered gift, and take possession, one after another. \[Page 15\]

The first of these two surrenders and its acceptance must, according to the natural course of things and the nature of the act, be the first in order. For in the intercourse of the Godhead with men the approach of divine freedom to human freedom is by far the more preeminent and worthy; the relation of that absolutely free divinity to what in man is subject to necessity is, however, only of a second and deeper order. The man must therefore, in the innermost secret of his reason‑illumined will, have made the decision for that surrender, and the free offering must have been accepted, before, after preceding trials and purifications, the lower, vital man is also drawn into the mystical relation --- a stage which then reveals itself in ecstasy. A life led with clear consciousness thus stands in relation to this ecstasy, if not in a necessary, yet in a frequently occurring connection; one as a rule, though not always, leads to the other, and only rarely or hardly ever is the converse path observed. But with regard to the demonic realm it will be otherwise disposed.

The Good in God is altogether of a substantial nature, and of the kind of eternal Substance in itself, and therefore through itself and from itself. Evil, however, even down to its deepest root, is not of substantial kind, but only the inherence in a created substance, arising in it through its own fault. Drawn into the alternation of opposing contraries, it therefore does not stand, as the Good in God does, in a free relation to the creature that approaches it and seeks above all the Free in the Good as that which is most closely akin to it. Rather, even entangled in discord between created freedom and the bondage of the produced Evil, the action of the latter does not conduce to unity in concord, but must fall apart into the opposition of separated states. Under circumstances, then, the bound element in Evil, precisely in the power of the bond that extends through the whole corrupted creation, can throw itself upon the bound element in human nature, passing entirely by its free element; and in violently seizing that element, the state of possession will be brought about, a state which exists for itself and in no wise proceeds from a consent of the human will. But it can also, if the free nature voluntarily comes toward it --- having, of its own impulse, taken the decision to leave the communion of the holy and enter that of the unholy --- accept this surrender; and when a pact of give and take is concluded, there may also exist between the contracting parties a free compact for unfreedom. This pact is therefore altogether severed from the other; each has its own origin; one proceeds preeminently from the radically evil, the other from the human being; each unfolds in its own intervals; neither leads directly to the other, they rather seem to lead away from one another; yet both terminate in ecstasy, which, both in intention and end‑goal and in its whole succession, is distinct in each. The difference in origin, to which our attention here is directed, therefore remains fixed at the outset. \[Page 16\]

If possession has taken its own into an objective power, and thus appears as more than a suffering and a demonic passion of man, then magic must have had its adherents in an act arrived at by self-determination and pursued with perseverance, and so will appear as demonic action, and as a chain of such actions. Just as possession, regarded as a disease, has its origin in the lower systems and, in its development, continues upward into the higher and highest, so magic will take its origin from those highest, and we must from there pursue it into the lower and lowest.

The question is now: to what will it attach itself at that origin, and what circumstances will prepare the way for it? The doctrine prevailing in the social environment will begin this preparation; natural disposition will carry on the work thus begun; and the individual's own perversion of will will complete it at last.

#### 1. Origins in Doctrine

#### A. Manichaeism as The Social Basis of Magic

\[Page 17\]

Man is driven by his innermost nature to gather around himself the good, and, as one holds to another within him, to form fellowships and unions about it. Yet we see him in all his demonic associations turn his back on the good, and having taken evil as his center, to conclude a new covenant in it and about it, and thereby to renounce his most intimate impulse. But man never resolves upon something purely irrational; for the higher spiritual as well as ethical conscience demands an accounting of his deeds, and he must at least set before it apparent reasons and principles in order to veil his eccentric doings with a show of right and consequence. To the perverse resolution in which his exit from the natural order and his entrance into the unnatural is rooted, he must therefore give a theoretical foundation that, by reversing the relation, makes the unnatural into nature and so causes his work to appear as the simple consequence of a fundamental principle. To such beginnings Manichaeism has at all times supplied just such a foundation, as we have already touched upon in the historical development of magical practice, and which we must now further expound and demonstrate in detail.

The Church has at all times held fast as the simple ground of all truth the doctrine: that the Good alone is truly substantial; whereas Evil, not touching the substance of the eternally Good, has entered into the originally good-created substance by its own fault only as an accident, which is merely borne by the substantial thing in which it inheres and thereby attains its substantiality. Evil in all that is human therefore opposes every good, injures it and obstructs it in its manifestations; but as an inherence it is unable to assail the truly substantial at the core from outside; this remains unhurt in the midst of all evil, as a vessel does not defile the content it encloses. In the thoroughgoing division of all earthly things the Church therefore regards only the Good as law, norm, measure and rule, and the relations among goods alone possess a higher reality in themselves; Evil, acting in the accidental, is exception and excess, and is not an independent entity. So judging, although it is the irreconcilable opponent of evil, the Church may nevertheless be mild toward those who bear it, and thus oppose any violent rupture of human nature and human institutions. Therefore it also recognizes a higher, truly substantial mysticism, in which the good in man strives to reconcile more closely with the Eternal Good; this mysticism alone is essential to it, because, by drawing the being of things from the fullness out of which they have taken their origin, it really raises and increases them within itself. Every other mysticism is, to it, because it closes itself in the accidental, a mysticism of deceptive appearance; and that which turns toward evil must entirely lack all inner true reality in itself, even if not with itself; for it seeks to complete itself in a direction that can offer it nothing, but rather takes from it and binds what it really possesses from elsewhere. Opposed to this doctrine Manichaeism has built up its own.

As its first principle it bases the proposition: Evil is by no means an accident, but is of the same substantiality as the Good; for good and evil, though opposed in direction, are nevertheless both equally essential; because one has not arisen through defect, lapse, or fault of the other. The opposition that separates them therefore goes down into the innermost root of all existence, back into eternal substance, and even the Godhead finds itself divided in it. In the Christian form which the doctrine assumed in Christian times, therefore, all that exists is neither created by one God nor subject to him; but there are two consubstantial principles, the God of Light and the God of Darkness, the good and the evil principle, of which one, the Almighty God, alone created the invisible and incorporeal, while the other, Lucifer, from eternity called forth the visible and corporeal.1) Thus two natures stand existing, separated in their innermost substance according to their creators: a good one of the incorporeal things, a bad one of the corporeal things; and this deepest inward split, which therefore divides all created things, will recur in man as well; and he will belong, with the visible and bodily half of his being, to the evil nature and its creator, but with the inner, invisible half only to the good and its originator, who creates nothing perishable. Sin is therefore from the very beginning by no means a product of free will, and then propagated itself as original sin; it does not now repeat itself in any such free action: rather it is the work of the God of Darkness. There is no other work that he practices than this sin, and there can be no sin on earth that has not occurred in heaven; for Hell became Heaven at the moment when its ruler set himself up as God. There is therefore no repentance after committed sin, the evil of punishment is likewise not from the good God, and souls are not condemned on account of sin; there is therefore no eternal damnation or expiation in a place of purgation. For the good God only gives life, but in no way kills; only the Evil one kills and quickens bodies, and God, who bestows grace, likewise does not avenge the wrong by evil or good recompense; hence the right to punish in no way belongs to the true Church.

Since, then, Adam the first man was not from God, neither are new souls henceforth continually created and poured in by God for generation; for generation itself is from the Evil, and therefore marriage is reprehensible; reprehensible is the use of the flesh, as of the unclean, for the maintenance of life; and the resurrection of the body is inadmissible, because the body belongs to the evil principle. Thus, just as God and Nature and Man are incurably rent by the doctrine, so likewise are history and the whole historical course of things. \[Page 18\]

Ancient times before Christ were indeed in evil; Moses was of the Evil, and his law was not good as that of a prophet; the Father, the good God, did not speak to the old patriarchs, he did not lead Israel out of Egypt, nor command circumcision; the Old Testament is not from God at all; all this has been ordered by the prince of Darkness. No salvation can therefore proceed from him, and before the appearance of Christ there were no good men, and even the ancient fathers were not saved. But when Christ came, who was not God, but also not a true man, who took his body neither from heaven nor from the mother, who was not a true woman; who did not eat in the flesh and did not suffer on the cross in the flesh, did not truly die, did not rise from death, did not descend to the nether world, nor ascend into heaven; precisely because he had only a phantastic body, like John the Baptist, who was of the Evil: when this bringer and Saviour came, he indeed did not take upon himself our penal liability; but it became possible through him to work salvation, and the Holy Spirit can be given by the laying on of hands, but not by the baptism of John, which is null and without effect.

Null is also the sacrament of the altar, null confession and the anointing with oil. Into the true God-founded Church henceforth good and evil could not enter together; for evil separates and parts from it at once. The material, visible Church, however, cannot be of the good, because it appears as one mixed of good and evil, and the sinful life of the clerics necessarily stains its work. In the true Church, however, no bad priests and deacons should be found, and no evil person may assume episcopal dignity. It is not permitted to it to have separate private property; it may possess only a common fund. It must not persecute the wicked, it cannot excommunicate, cannot make its own constitutions; in it there should be prayed and sung only the Prayer of the Lord; the funeral office with its prayers, however, is of evil; from the Evil too is the application of any violence and the invocation of the punishing arm of justice on its part, because man is still capable of conversion. The swearing of oaths is, moreover, to be avoided in it; alms are to be given only to the good; only he who belongs to it can be saved, but that can by no means occur through mere faith.

If we consider the content of this doctrine more closely in its relation to our Church, then we perceive that both proceed from one and the same ground, the recognition of a twofold law in man, the law in the spirit and the law in the flesh. But the Church, in that she allows this double-law to be held as unavoidable, does by no means recognize in one half of it the law of the spiritual substance as such, and in the other that of the corporeal; rather, by referring one to the good principle and the other to the evil, she makes the dualism of the two insurmountable, and so transfers it into the eternal substance. The law of the flesh, on the contrary, is for her operative in both realms --- of spirit as well as of flesh, namely the fallen --- while the law of the spirit likewise has force in both, but as it proceeded from the hand of their Creator and insofar as, despite the Fall, it has been preserved in this condition. \[Page 19\]

Thus the dualism is confined to a historical sphere, to the domain of the accidental; but because the elements of the relation are of the nature of substantial accidents, in this doctrine the law of the spirit is not able by its own power to overcome the law of the flesh and to regain its lordship. Yet this may succeed for it with the aid of the higher Divine, which, by its immutability, is not touched by the opposition; and its endeavour is directed to, with mildness and forbearance enduring the inevitable in all that is human, to awaken the upward‑striving impulse and to equip it more and more, and thereby to draw down the descending salvation of redemption upon those who strive upward.

The other teaching, however, has entrenched the opposition by dividing it into the visible bodily things and the invisible spiritual things, and assigning both to the still higher of the two gods, of Light and of Darkness. The man who in the Church indeed lives in two natures, which are both the Lord's, and is only by his morbid perversion open to the temptations of the enemy, serves but one master; whereas in that teaching he stands under double lordship, belonging with his body to the powers of Darkness, but with his spirit turned toward the Lord of Light. He therefore of necessity belongs to two churches, and finds himself pressed to enter into a twofold fellowship; one of which tolerates no evil within itself, the other just as effectually casts out and keeps far from itself the good --- and now both meet in him, held in such close proximity only by the accidental bond of life. His attitude and his fate will now depend upon the relation into which the two principles have placed themselves. If these have divided themselves into the two hemispheres and sit peacefully side by side, then there will be peace also in him; with his body he has native status in the realm of Darkness and performs works of Darkness; with his spirit, however, he is an aborigine in the realm of Light and performs works of Light; and the two practices may, insofar as they can, tolerate one another. But if both powers are now at war, if one seeks to subdue the other, he is not permitted to remain neutral; and it then depends upon whither his being drives him with predominance. If the spirit, by the power of fate, is the stronger, then he turns toward the direction from which the stronger impulse comes; he joins the fighters of Light, becomes one of the Cathars who seek purity. But he must then above all fight the part of Lucifer in himself and strike it down to destruction, that he may be a worthy combatant; and is thus driven into a false, exuberant mysticism tending to self‑annihilation. Or he feels that, conversely, by that same power of fate, the flesh is stronger than the spirit; and in that case he enrolls himself among the dark hosts and fights their battles. In both cases he is in the service of an absolute and eternal Lord; there as here his contest, however, will every time be directed against the visible Church on earth; there because of its earthly faults, here because of the good that is in and about it.

As we have seen in the historical account, the false doctrine had long ravaged the East when the first traces of its transplanting to the West appeared at the beginning of the eleventh century in the castle of Montfort, in the diocese of Asti, and there found its martyrs. It then, during the two following centuries, spread further in secret, and by the beginning of the thirteenth had branched into fifteen different sects throughout the greater part of Italy and the whole Romance South, and had also contrived to force a way into the Germanic North. By the nature of the thing the tendency of their adherents in all these sects had to split in two directions, and the opposition again sought its reconciliation in a third, middle course.

Those who by temperament, orientation, and vocation had resolved in favor of the good principle pursued that direction with the whole one-sided, spiritualistic aloofness of the system --- devoting themselves to an asceticism which, according to circumstances, was severe and austere, or at least professing a stoical purity of morals that justified them in attacking the corruptions in the Church and in charging the Church itself as a work of darkness. They therefore formed the outward, conspicuous side of the sect, by which above all they won the confidence of the people; and so generally recognized was this strictness of morals as their salient characteristic that any such merciless, exaggerated severity was wont to be called "Patalia" (from the name of the sect Patalini), and in the conflict which Arnaldo, in Gregory's time, raised in Milan against the married, simoniacal priests, they called his beginning an unseemly, accursed Patalia.

He, however, against whom this harshness was directed, lost nothing by the matter; the corruption of the age made up to him, which Peter Damian summed up in a few words: shame has perished, honesty has vanished, religion has fallen, and, as it were, the whole host of saintly virtues has gone far away.

In the midst of this dissolution the adversary now found confessors in great numbers, who, supported by the system and fully justified by its principles, thought it better to adhere to him and to avow themselves for his cause. For, as every principle will not let men rest until they have realized it in the full development of all its consequences and moments, so under their hands the realm of darkness likewise grew into a perfect kingdom of Satan, to which they swore the oath of subjection, in which they then took upon themselves the apostolate, and which they sought to spread by missions.

When, meanwhile, those who held to the other side considered it advisable to come forward with their teaching, the interest of the cause they espoused and the invincibility of the shame bound to conscience drove the others back into the darkness and obscurity which they in truth served. While some strove openly, the others therefore withdrew behind the veil of secret associations, which celebrated their dark mysteries in woods and caves and on mountain heights. Both served extreme tendencies: for on the one hand they would not curb and govern the law of the flesh by the power of a higher might, but set themselves to deny it or to destroy it by their own self-sufficient might; on the other hand they were just as bent on annihilating and extirpating the law of the Spirit. \[Page 20\]

Against such extreme directions, however, the common healthy sense of mankind revolts everywhere, and leaves their prosecution only to the few who feel the vocation for it within themselves. The church of naked light and that of darkness therefore formed only minorities in the midst of the sect; the great mass sought a moderate middle which would permit it to live and let live. On the higher road of the Church, through the higher middle, that could not be attained; the system opposed it, for it was wholly at variance with it. Nothing remained, then, but to gain, within the same system, by a reciprocal tempering of the two extremes, a kind of mechanical middle in the balance of the tendencies which, while it kept off the inconveniences of the extremes, measured out a life in calm worldly prudence, and prepared for itself a more comfortable modus vivendi that indeed sacrifices to evil but nevertheless knows how to increase its enjoyments from the spiritual realms.

Such a middle, presenting itself in many gradations, was joined, in this pervasive heresy of the Middle Ages, by the decidedly largest majority of its adherents, especially of the higher ranks; while the far smaller number placed itself only on the two extreme points, and the one party accepted the half-year polar day as its portion, the others the equally long night.

Among these various orders of the false teachers we must here follow, with preference, the night-spirits; although these, bound up in the common system with those who regarded themselves toward the light, were again closely connected with them, and even externally in their organizations hung together. If they wished, then, to carry on their missionary works successfully, they must above all know how to surround themselves with the alluring shimmer of the miraculous, and the promising charm of great powers over which they claimed authority. They probably found this enchantment in the magical arts and traditions which they had brought from the East, and in the exercise of which they everywhere appeared as possessors of great secrets. We have already, on the occasion of the sect that worked in the north of Germany, cited what was believed there of their gift for miracles. Cæsarius has adduced another example concerning this, which clearly expresses the opinion of the time about miraculous power, and its relation to the ecclesiastical. \[Page 21\]

At the time, he says, when the heresy of the Albigenses first began to make itself known, some of the evil sort, strengthened by the power of the devil, wrought certain wonders and signs which not only confirmed the heretics but also seduced many faithful. They walked, among other feats, upon the water, and did not sink. When a priest, honest in faith and religious disposition, perceived this, and reflected that true signs could not stand with a false doctrine, he carried the Body of the Lord in a pyx to the river where these people were performing their powers before the people, and spoke aloud in the hearing of all present: I adjure you, Satan, by Him whom I hold here in my hands, that you cease, on this river, to exercise such conjuring to the corruption of these people! After these words, when the false teachers went on, as before, to walk upon the waves, the priest, thereby agitated, cast the Body of the Lord into the flood. Wonderful power of the Lord over the elements! The moment the Sacrament touched the waves, the illusion of the deceit gave way; the false partisans, like lead sinking to the abyss, drowned, while the pyx was taken away by angels. The priest, seeing all this, rejoiced indeed at the miracle, but he was pained by the loss of the Sacrament; he spent the whole night in prayer and sighing, and found in the morning the lost thing with the pyx upon the altar. This was told to us at the same time. \[Page 22\]

The reporter cites no guarantor, no place, and no name; he therefore took it from legend, which however expresses the opinion of the time. The same appears in another account preserved by his contemporary Cantipratanus. When M. Conrad preached in Germany against the heretics, where he also suffered the martyr's death, one of them, as I heard from Brother Conrad, the Dominican provincial in Germany, being led astray by demons, sought to win over a brother of the same order to the heresy. But when he perceived the brother's violent resistance he said to him: "You are very stubborn in your faith, of which, however, you know only some things from Scripture; but if you were to give me your belief, I would by actual sight show you Christ, his mother, and the saints themselves." The brother suspected a deception of the demon, but, because he wished to try what was true in the matter, he said: "I would with good reason give you belief if you could accomplish that." The heretic rejoiced at this, and set a day for the meeting; the brother, however, took the Sacrament of the Body of Christ secretly under his cloak with him. The heretic now led the brother into the cave of a mountain, into a spacious, light-filled palace. As they entered the interior of the castle they saw thrones set there as of the purest gold, upon which sat a light-encircled king and a queen arrayed in serene beauty; at her side were chairs of the elders, who, like patriarchs and apostles, surrounded her in the midst of the angels; everything shone so that it seemed anything but demonic. When the introducer beheld them, he fell on his face and worshipped them. The brother, however, stood unmoved, astonished at the spectacle before his eyes. Then the heretic turned to him and said: "Why do you not worship the Son of God whom you see before you? Come forward, and, paying him homage, receive from his mouth the mysteries of our faith!" The brother then came nearer, drew out the pyx, and offered it to the queen who sat on the throne, saying: "Are you indeed the queen and mother of Christ? See there your son! If you acknowledge him, then I will acknowledge you as his mother." At these words the whole phantom vanished, and after the fading of the brightness so dense a darkness spread that the brother with his guide scarcely found the way out. The heretic, however, terrified by the marvelous guile of the demon, returned to the faith.

Even more fully is the narrative preserved for us in the form in which Picus of Mirandola gives it. In the Rhaetian Alps, about twelve years earlier, there was a pious priest who, being summoned to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist to a sick man and the road being long, mounted a horse and, after hanging the pyx with the sacrament about his neck, rode on his way. After riding for a while someone met him who invited him to dismount from the horse so that, in his company, he might witness a wonderful spectacle. The parish priest, out of curiosity, imprudently followed the invitation, and had hardly alighted from his horse when he felt himself borne through the air with his companion. After a short while they stood on the summit of an exceedingly high mountain, in a wide, exceedingly lovely plain, bordered by the noblest trees and enclosed by dreadful rocks. Beneath the trees they found ring-dances winding and divers sorts of games, tables laden with costly foods; they heard sounds and songs full of every loveliness; whatever could delight the mind and gladden the heart was present there in abundance. \[Page 23\]

The simple, good clergyman, astonished at the unexpected sight, and, from wonder, daring neither to speak nor to move, stood there as if stunned and out of his senses. Then the companion who had brought him said: would he not venerate the queen present, and visit her with a gift? She sat on a high throne, dressed in royal adornment; all those present approached her, two or four at a time and in perfect order prostrating themselves before her, and paying her homage while presenting gifts. The clergyman, when he thus perceived her in the radiance of her glory, surrounded by many, believed: it was the Mother of the Lord, the Queen of Heaven and Earth; and he had no inkling that anything demonic was hidden behind her. Considering to himself what he should present to her as a gift, he thought: he could bring her nothing dearer or more pleasing than the body of her Son. So he went up to her, and, as he fell at her feet, he took the little case with the Sacrament, which he had hung about his neck, and laid it in the woman's lap. Wonderful! Everything vanished at once. The man, struck by this, now recognized how he had been ensnared by false signs and wonders; and when he found himself abandoned in the gloom of dense forests, he cried to God for help with trembling, that He would deliver him from such dangers. After having wandered for a long time astray and about in the woods, he at last found a shepherd who informed him that he was some hundred miles from the place where he had wished to carry the Eucharist. Having returned to his place of residence, he reported the matter to the magistrate. The incident took place, however, under the reign of Emperor Maximilian.

The old relation of heathenism to Christianity---now transferred to that of heresy to the true faith---lies at the root of all these tales, and one sees, for example, that earlier one about the old Frisian king Radbod, who led his convert to the glorious Valhalla, but which, under the sign of the Christian cross, vanished, clearly shining through.

If such tales, in their individual circumstances, also appear as products of lively imagination, yet a higher basis of truth nevertheless lies in them, and a higher power has allied itself with the poetic in its formative work; so that a fundamental idea, in its comprehensive and general truth, governs and sustains the contingence of the circumstances. Such an idea, precisely because it is universal, also belongs to the universal power of the human spirit; and has in many cases tested itself as such on facts and experiences which, while mutually explaining and correcting one another, finally resulted in the confirmation and guarantee of the common idea; which therefore has always remained behind, after the experiences long since have fallen prey to oblivion; and in which the legend now, freely operating according to circumstances, again consistently develops the particular. \[Page 24\]

This idea here is the conviction of the magical powers of the heretics, as formerly of those of heathenism; powers which, before the force of truth that, if need be, pours forth miracles from the Church, can never endure. The miraculous gift of the false doctrine, however, manifests itself here by deceitfully clothing evil with borrowed splendor, making it appear as something good; a deception which then dissolves at the approach of truth. It can also make itself known in another way, by letting this evil consist in its terror and dreadfulness, yet presenting it as a power that, though fearsome, is bound to it. From this mode there then sprang another class of tales, which extends from the invocations of the demon in front of the circle of the necromancer to the necromancer's relations with it; a root of legend that has burst forth in many shoots and that connects itself with the historical in manifold entanglements. \[Page 25\]

Caesarius thus relates: a knight, who could not be convinced of the reality of demons, had urgently entreated a cleric, who was very proficient in necromancy, that he would show him some. This man, after having strongly admonished him, at last --- once he had obtained a safeguard for every contingency --- led him at noon to a crossroads. There he drew a circle around him with his sword, and then warned him: that in his absence he should not make the sign of the cross, give or promise anything to the demanding spirits, nor by terror or encouragement be induced to bring even a limb of his body out of the circle, because otherwise he would be dead; after this he went away. The knight sat for a while in the circle, when he perceived the inundation of many waters coming toward him; he heard the roaring of furious winds, then the grunting of many swine; but none of this could frighten him. Soon, however, he saw in the nearby wood a dreadful shape, like the shadow of a man, coming toward him over the trees, and understood that it was the Devil. The figure stopped at the circle, and asked him what he wanted. It was to be compared to a great, exceedingly black man, clad in garments of the same color, and so hideous that the knight could not bear to look at it. Meanwhile he said to the coming one: You come to me at the right time, for I have asked to see you. --- For what? --- I have heard much of you. --- What have you heard? --- Much evil, little good! --- The Black (one) replied: Often people judge without cause; I have injured no one without being provoked; therefore ask your master, who is my friend, whether I have ever done him any harm; I do what pleases him, and he commands me in all things. The knight, however: Where were you when I called you? The answer: I was as far beyond the sea as the distance from here to the sea; therefore it will be fair that you reward me somewhat for my trouble. Now he first demands his cloak; on his refusal then the belt, then a sheep from the flock, lastly the cock of his yard, that it should crow for him. But when he refused him everything, he stretched his arm toward him; so that the knight, shrieking, recoiled; whereupon the master ran up and made the specter disappear. Another man, who allowed the same master to show him the demon, was not so fortunate. He let himself be terrified, was drawn out of the circle, and so treated that he died on the third day. In a third tale it is Swabian and Bavarian students who make the attempt in Toledo. Before the circle the spirits appear in the form of armed bands of warriors, who play at war and with lances and swords try to frighten them from their security. Then they change into beautiful girls, who practice all the arts of seduction to lure them out. They all, however, remain steadfast except one, who is enticed to put a finger into the ring which one of these sirens offers him; he is therefore pulled out and disappears. The students, especially the Bavarians, a fierce people, threaten the master with death if he does not return the stolen man. Appalled by this, he convenes a council of the demons about the case; in which they agree to give the stolen man back. The idea underlying these narratives is as follows. Just as the Church of the Lord recognizes possessions and hauntings among its people for the cleansing of those possessed, whereby in clairvoyance the possessor or the one sitting upon them is seen; so the church of darkness, for the initiation and advancement of its own, likewise has these states, and they are produced by the black art. \[Page 26\]

The Church of Light, in such cases, keeps the inhabitants of its realm enclosed within a circle which the besieging or even bodily-invading spirit does not dare to cross; unless human freedom itself should break over the circle, or pay it homage, even with the smallest part of its own. Likewise, in that other relation, the black art keeps its own people confined within the circle drawn by the tip of the sword; it determines the limits of the atmosphere that surrounds the man, which the spirit of darkness does not dare to penetrate; authority therefore comes to it from within, just as from within, by the sign of the cross, in the mighty ban of the Church, the whole work is undone.

Legend, in carrying out this idea, pays no heed to whether in particular cases fraud and scenic arts have co-operated; for the deception lies along the whole line of the enterprise. Cæsarius, however, has at the same time given those accounts as historical. He names as the master of the magic the cleric Philipp, who in those times was much in demand; he knew him personally, and this Philipp, a few years before Cæsarius wrote, as was believed, had been killed at the instigation of his friend and master. In the first case he names the knight Heinrich, born at Castle Faltenstein, cupbearer of Cæsarius of our order and at that time abbot of Prüm, from whose mouth he learned the course of events. Since that adventure, after the loss of his natural colour, he had always remained pale, and he, too, had died not long before. In the second case the same Philipp had taken part, and the house of the slain man had been confiscated by Walram of Luxemburg. The third story had been told him by his fellow-member of the order, Gedschalt of Volmunstein, and he had questioned that Philipp about it, who claimed to have experienced it during his stay in Toledo.

Here, then, some ground of truth must be hidden, and Weyer, where in his book De praestigiis daemonum (Book II) he speaks of certain magical writings, leads us on their trail. He reports, namely from them: the prescription is that, when the circle is drawn, the neophyte must walk in it in a continual whirl from east to west, until, seized by dizziness, he falls down; whereupon ecstasy then seizes the prostrate man, and one will appear to him who gives him further enlightenment. That is the old practice, as we have shown, of the shamans in Siberia; that of the North American Indians in their forests, who, with a rope twisted about the neck, whirl themselves round a post, everything relying on a technical maneuver that produces vertigo. The skilled practitioner then becomes clairvoyant, and along demonic paths demonic powers meet him.

The traditional secret was in subsequent times lost, and only the legendary remained. Thus there existed traditions of demonic arts in this Church, which were applied especially at initiations. The principle, in whose name the initiation took place, had to present itself, whether plastically and spiritually to the waking man, or pictorially to the clairvoyant, to the perception; and here the form of the goat, which had already played that important role in the ancient service of the Mendesians, offered itself in both cases as the most suitable. We have earlier cited, from the older times, individual facts that point to such practices. That, however, the thing itself was not altogether lost in later centuries is proved by the following remarkable story, which Brognoli, as an informed witness, has preserved for us in his writings.

##### The Story of The Unrepentant Magician

\[Page 27\]

About the middle of the seventeenth century there lived in northern Italy a man versed in both laws and devoted to the study of philosophy; moreover, endowed with a penetrating keenness of mind, and therefore eager to penetrate into the deeper mysteries of things. He had given himself up, by constant association, to learned but unbelieving people, magicians, and men of similar ilk, who initiated him into their arts and doctrines and infected him with their evil habits. He, who now wished to put into practice what he had learned theoretically, in order thereby to satisfy his desires --- which he could not accomplish without demonic help --- allowed himself to be carried away by them to give himself over to him who granted them and to his service, and in turn to seduce others to that service. The relationship had already continued for a good number of years, when one night he was so badly mistreated and almost strangled by him to whom he had given himself, that --- since even his mother had pleaded to God in prayer for that reason --- against his will he resolved to return to God and to call for His help.

Partly on the advice of his elders, partly through the encouragement of Father Carolus von Belitri, Vicar of the Holy Office in Tarvis, finally determined, he betook himself, as to a safe place, to the house of the Office with that vicar, as to a friend. He was now to go there to confession, and for that purpose a pious and discerning theologian was chosen; who, finding him by no means sufficiently prepared, took every pains to bring out what was still lacking by his exhortation and to examine his conscience in a fitting manner. But behold, at that moment his evil spirit again began to seize upon all his senses, and repeatedly to call out from his mouth: I, I am Satan; I, I am this man's lord and owner; he, he may not and cannot make his confession, and I will never permit it. By virtue of the pact which he has concluded with me, he is bound to me and belongs to me; he has solemnly promised me to obey me in all things, never to make a proper confession, nor ever to forsake me. The clergyman was at first frightened by this speech, but then, strengthened in the Lord, he asked the speaker what he wanted here. Thereupon the instigator of all evil answered: This man is the worst scoundrel, who has long consorted with unbelievers, still possesses many of their books, and is always ready for every evil; since he therefore does not commit as much evil as his baseness and wickedness prompt him to, I remain here to watch over him. Thus and the like said the crafty guardian who had plunged him into the abyss of all vices, and who now vaunted himself to be guarding him against greater evil. But when the priest ceased to speak of things that concerned his soul's salvation and turned to indifferent matters, the voice likewise at once ceased to speak through him, and did not hinder him in the use of his senses and faculties. Yet when another time the priest exhorted him with exorcisms not to hinder his confession any longer, the man burst into a furious laugh, and, with face, mouth, and fists, attacked the exorcist, mocking and scoffing at him, so that he appeared utterly mad. If the clergyman desisted a second time, he likewise ceased his rages and his laughter and his taunts, and addressed him seriously and with mature consideration, like a learned and prudent man; asserting at the same time that he from the bottom of his heart cursed all wrongdoing. \[Page 28\]

But as soon as, with his mouth --- the man who spoke these words --- he would renounce these misdeeds, confess them sacramentally in confession, or would name the companions and co‑sinners of his vices, he immediately felt his heart bound and pressed; whereupon he then burst forth with the greatest violence and vehemence, and was driven to laughter and ridicule by a power which he could not resist. He confessed that it inwardly determined and carried him away to despise, to deride and to abase the priest who advised him to do penance; and nothing then appeared to him more pleasing and delightful than to hold all religious people and clerics, all clerical ordinations, offices, usages and ceremonies in contempt, to mock them and to trample them underfoot. This did not happen merely once, but whenever he was appointed to any act that could be useful to his soul; especially when, being persuaded by the priest, he was to renounce his errors before the Vicar of the Inquisition. Then he at once broke out into the most violent derisive laughter, and although he strove to drive away force with force, and to write while kneeling and to produce good acts, nothing came of it; he was suddenly overcome by the demon, upset the inkwell, and fled, wrenching himself away with great fury. \[Page 29\]

Who can resist referring all this to the evil spirit, which, supported by many years of bad habit, applied every means to assert its right over this its adherent. Not that it possessed him in his body, tormenting and afflicting him like the possessed, without extending its power to their souls. Rather it was, as with all sorcerers and evildoers, always present to him merely as the owner of his soul as well as of his body, and acted according to the circumstances; now in his body binding his heart, contracting it, expanding it, and exciting in it many often opposite passions; then again moving his throat, mouth, tongue, eyes, lips and the other members of the body in many ways; and alternately affecting his internal sensitive powers by diverse objects, as seemed advantageous to it, so that it might hold him forever in its subjection.

Now I, relates Father Brognoli, in the same year, coming from Rome to Bergamo, lodged in a place only a little distance from the city, which that magician inhabited; I was urged by the venerable father‑provincial of that reformed province and by the clergyman of whom I have just spoken to take under my charge the aforesaid jurist, whom the clerical exorcists declared to be possessed by the demon, but whom the physicians pronounced insane. When he was brought to me, I first began to speak with him alone about many matters, and I recognized from his speech and answers soon that he was not foolish and out of his senses, as the physicians said, but of very sound understanding, learned, quick of spirit and sharp‑witted. Now, however, in the presence of that clergyman and of a noble jurist, his friend, I began to invoke the demon with exorcisms. But the one being exorcised was not, as commonly happens with the possessed, tormented by the exorcisms; instead he burst into laughter and threatened me with his fists. When I had seen this, and remembered the pact that he had concluded with the demon, and how he had already served him for eight years and been devoted to the magical being, I judged it necessary to employ other means.

Therefore, partly urged by himself, partly appointed by the entreaties of his friend, the other legally trained man, as well as by the clerics, to take him more closely under my supervision; I went to the place where he himself lived, had from the Father Inquisitor the necessary authority over him transferred to me, and then, after invoking divine help, in the monastery there, in the presence of our reverend provincial, of a Father Definitor, and of the companion of that man, commanded in the name of our Lord the demon: that they in no way hinder the external or internal faculties and abilities of the person, and that they answer all my questions freely and without obstruction. \[Page 30\]

I then asked him for what reason he had turned to our Order, and had especially summoned me, and what he required of me. He answered: So that I might learn whether I am bound by a maleficium, or possessed, or suffer from some other illness. For I feel my heart bound and compressed toward a young man, so that I can scarcely draw breath; and yet I will not break forth into love toward him; but that, I suppose, comes from a maleficium. If therefore you bring out that the evil has its origin in this; then I beg that by your remedies you will restore my health.

When from this speech I perceived that he was not moved for the love of God, nor out of sorrow for having offended Him; but, like another Antiochus, willing to give way to the demon in order to avert the scourge from his body, I said to him: I assure you with all the certainty that a servant of Christ and of the Church can have, that if you are struck by a maleficium you shall be healed, on the following three conditions: First, you must obey me in all things that I shall command you, spirituallly or bodily. Secondly, you must reveal to me all the thoughts, words and deeds of your life, as far as possible, and especially from the time onward when you engaged with unbelievers and consorted with demons, up to this hour. Thirdly, you must give ear to the reasons and authorities which I adduce to persuade you of the evangelical truth; and if anything occurs to you in opposition, you must communicate it to me, so that I may resolve your doubts. He promised solemnly in the presence of the clerics and the legally trained man to fulfil all this.

So that he might not again break into his laughter and mock me, I commanded him on the spot to make the following retractation: "I, N. N., have learned that whenever I would undertake any act conducive to my healing, I am compelled with the utmost force to laughter, and thus forced to reject all remedies useful to my body and soul. Therefore I declare here on my knees before God, my Creator and Redeemer, and before you, my spiritual father, with all my heart and with my whole soul and with all my strength: that if from this moment I laugh, or perform any act which is meant to express scorn and contempt, I do then laugh Beelzebub, the prince of the demons (so he called him to whom he had devoted himself), to scorn and derision, as do all his adherents; because they, out of pride, have abandoned their God, and, yielding themselves to eternal punishment, have forgotten Him." \[Page 31\]

"I will likewise laugh for joy that God, in the infinite fullness of his mercy and goodness, has forgiven me all my sins, which, whenever I laugh, I every time from my whole heart denounce; for they are insults against my God, Creator and Redeemer, whom I must love above all. Therefore, you devils, having tempted, moved, and driven me to laughter at your pleasure; yet it shall, according to my intention, always be to scorn you, and to the salvation of my soul!"

After all this had thus been arranged among us, the laughter was suddenly turned to sorrow. From then on, when things holy were spoken of, he never laughed again; rather he seemed seized by the deepest pain and the blackest melancholy. Wherefore I begged the others to leave us, so that I remained alone with him, and then questioned him about everything he had done and what had happened to him: about the pact he had concluded with the demon; about the confession he had made to him; his promises, accomplices; about the books of the heretics; his master Hämmerlein; about his presence at the Sabbath, and all that there is done there by the sorcerers, the lords and demons; the pleasures and the magnificences that he had obtained from the demon; finally, about everything that had occurred during the eight years that he had served him --- all of which he told me, albeit with some difficulty.

He said how, a year earlier, before he had bound himself to the demon, he had had much intercourse with magicians and malefactors, among whom there had been Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Manichaeans, but for the most part atheists; and how he then set himself to the study of their books and teachings. Then first he came to renounce God; and now he found himself prepared to perform everything necessary for the demonic confession. As to the initiation, he reported that it had proceeded thus: the act took place in the year 1638, in a cave of the Genoese mountains, to which he had traveled with nine other magicians, in the company of all the heretics with whom he had then been staying in a certain city on account of his studies.

When they arrived at the appointed place they had found the demon there in human shape, sitting upon a stone; with fire-spraying eyes, a goat's beard, horns, clawed hands, ox-like feet; with a hoarser, thinner, but terrible voice. At his sight they all fell down with their burning pitch-torches, which they carried in their hands, and paid him homage by kissing his hindparts. Then the first magician rose from their circle and, while the others remained on their knees, addressed the seated one, setting forth how he brought a new novice to him --- a learned doctor of both laws, likewise well-instructed theologian, whom he presented here and begged him to receive among his own.

The Prince of Darkness, pleased thereat, answered that the neophyte should present his wishes. He replied: "My wish is that you show me a treasure and the way to raise it; also that you use no deception or other trick upon me, but provide me with true gold and silver. Then you should teach me the art of going and walking invisibly to wherever my lust and desire strive. Furthermore, the demons that I call should not refuse to comply with my wishes, and should bring me everywhere I wish with the greatest speed, and perform everything that I demand of them." \[Page 32\]

The demon then said: All this is easy, if he first renounce God and firmly believe that there is no other God than him, the demon; renounce the remaining articles of faith, the sacraments and sacramentals; all his life hold religious and clerical persons in contempt and deride them; regard all clerical rites as null, never go to confession, and consider that confession itself as an invention of the priests to deceive the simple. The novice promised to observe all of this exactly, except the first. "That there is no other God but the demon" contradicts my reason, which bids me the contrary, he said. Then the most distinguished of the magi, who among them was regarded as a kind of bishop, took the mediation upon himself, addressing the newcomer with the words: If you will not immediately believe as I do that there is no god but the demon, then at least believe: there are two gods, one, the Creator of the invisible and spiritual things; the other, the demon, founder of all corporeal and visible things. The novice answered: I can readily give my belief to that.

Thus were now the Lord, the Holy Virgin, the sum of all articles of faith, sacraments, clerical rites and ceremonies abjured; and to the demon, after repeated kisses, fidelity was pledged, the confession made; and over all this a written bond was drawn up and sealed by the magician's own hand. He then received from the prince of demons a Martinet or Martinell assigned to him, so that it should be at his hand everywhere. This one, in company with the Martinelli of the other magi, brought before them a splendid carriage drawn by four white camels; which the whole magical society mounted, and was then borne with the greatest speed before sunset to the city which they inhabited. He told all this not jokingly, but in full seriousness; adding that he had earlier communicated it to the reverend inquisitor, before whose tribunal he had appeared, indeed with his mouth but not with his heart: all in accordance with what Petrus of Abano left in his writings. Moreover he said he was ready to abjure all these errors from full conviction.

He then went on to say: he had been led by the demons to England, France, Germany, and had in Trento, Bergamo, Briren, Verona and in many other cities, together with other sorcerers, attended the gatherings, and again related this all in earnest. Fully in his senses he also told me: We magi and necromancers, when we do not wish to go to such nocturnal assemblies ourselves, then our art teaches us to draw certain necromantic circles, by murmuring a few words, to summon certain demons, and to offer certain adorations to their chief; then we are relieved of being present there and of the labors connected with it, and the demon appears on our behalf. Thus I myself have often acted, by making the circles in my room and adding the rest; yet at other times I have also attended the Sabbath in nearly all the cities of the Venetian territory. \[Page 33\]

The women, however, and the magi of low rank, since they do not possess the higher knowledge, are obliged to appear at every assembly, unless they can produce a sufficient, truly excusing cause. At the third hour of the night the Martinelli assemble; then their protégés must also be present. Those who come too late or not at all are, wherever they are, struck with illnesses, and are tormented not only during the night of the celebration but also for the following days in body and soul: so that everything they undertake comes to nothing in their hands, until they swear an oath to be more attentive in future.

In order not to be recognized, the more distinguished and wealthy persons in particular appear covered with a mask, a net, or a veil, which he confirmed by repeated testimony. They would also, for the same reason, not appear under their own proper names. Instead they are called by the names of their native towns, or even of foreign places, with the addition of another place-name, e.g. Brescia of Venice, Palatiolum of Milan, when several belonged to the same place.

What is told of the pitch-torches at these festivals, of the offerings that each brings, &c. he confirmed all from experience; and, asked what he himself sacrificed, he answered: the blood of menstruating women, which the witches of his place supplied to him, and which seemed to be especially pleasing to the demon. He added: the commanding demon of the city where he lives is called Beelzebub; and he has 20,000 demons disposed to every sort of evil under his rule. To himself, however, by virtue of his magical insight, full dominion over the demons had been granted at his will; and he could, by a ring or by some other instrument, bind them and use them for his purposes; but he would neither be used nor forced by them. For all who truly possess magic could, by the power of that art, summon the demons, tame them, make them do their will, and enclose them in rings, vessels, and the like. \[Page 34\]

When I, says Brognoli, exposed to him the folly of this fancy, he replied one day that he would give me a proof of his power, and by his necromantic circles summon the 30,000 demons that served him. I, for my part, answered: I will for that purpose on the following day, with God's help, preserve myself in the power of Him and of the name of Jesus, to whom sufficient authority and efficacy have been given to put all demons to flight. At that time he lived in the house of the Inquisition, directly beneath the sitting-room of the Inquisitor, Carlo of Velitri. On the following night the latter, as well as one of his friends from the laity, in the room where the magician was alone, heard much speech of the demons; it seemed to come from a great assembled multitude, in which all cried out confusedly, raged in fury, blasphemed God, and boasted how they would do me to death; which they twice attempted that night, yet each time were driven off from my cell by a fear that came over them. By this noise and the shouting which they raised, the Inquisitor and his companion were filled with great terror; and both dared not go to the door of the room in which the magician lived, until I came, and, trusting in divine help, entered the room, and thereby impressed upon him the powerlessness and weakness of the demons. The same was also attested to me by his grown brother, who told me how he had very often heard the voices of many speakers, although the sick man had been alone in the room or in the stable of his house, who, under loud laughter, blasphemed God; which each time caused him the greatest fright.

The same man, a serious person, also solemnly declared that the brother was heard on almost every night uttering dreadful blasphemies against God, and mocking and deriding Him; which he himself, when I afterwards asked him about it, admitted, adding that he cast them forth in his inward wrath, roused by the violent passion that filled his heart against that young man, and from which he could only free himself by such outbursts. All of that then led directly to atheism, to which several of the magicians with whom he associated daily, according to his own statement, professed themselves.

All this and his whole remaining behaviour left little hope of his deliverance. I had appointed a day on which he should come to Mass and make the beginning of a sacramental confession. He promised everything; but the demon produced a stiffness and numbness in his body, so that it seemed to him as if it were cold, hard and earthbound; so that he could not stir himself from his bed. After two days I visited him, reproaching him for not having come at the appointed hour. He replied, "Excuse me, for I cannot rise from the bed nor move from the spot; yet I am content and satisfied and feel no sort of pain." When I thereupon commanded the demon not to hinder him, he rose immediately and went to our cloister. But when he wished to confess his sins, there was not the smallest sign of sorrow or inwardness to be perceived in him; which occurred repeatedly over the course of the month. He several times appeared ready to make his confession, and said, "My offences grieve me in my heart," although he was not in a state to show any outward contrition. But hardly had he knelt down when it seemed as if the whole act he performed were entirely empty and altogether irrational; and he said he was aware of no mortal sin. After scarcely begun questioning he already stood up, saying, "I remember no transgression at all." \[Page 35\]

Often, when I sought by wholesome exhortations to prepare him for confession, he immediately broke off the conversation and went away, as if someone had urgently summoned him; which he also did frequently with the Inquisitor. When I reminded him to accuse himself of diabolical magic, the invocation of spirits, and other such crimes, he answered: he could not accuse himself of that, because it was an excellent, holy thing worthy of no reproach; he had a pure conscience, unstained by any crime, nor defiled by any vice; and all that he undertook was permitted and right and holy. If, therefore, he had formed a purpose of repentance, the matter was always turned by the demon to the contrary; because his purpose never aimed at God, but at the removal of the bodily evil with which he felt afflicted.

He told me this often in the words: "I do not want you to cleanse my conscience by confession; for we magicians and necromancers are all sure of our salvation, and do not need confession; because contrition is sufficient for us, as Peter of Abano teaches us in his writings. I therefore ask only that you free me from the maleficium, should such a thing have struck me." Thus he referred everything solely to his bodily health, and no desire arose in him to attend to his spiritual health in order to cure himself of the illness that kept him down. After I had dealt with him for a month he was, for the time being, dismissed home by the Inquisitor. With the increase of this illness he, despairing of any cure, wished to put an end to his own life.

Since he could not leave the bed on which he lay, he incessantly called to those present: Give me a sword or a dagger, with which I can quickly remove myself from the world! Why do I delay any longer? I need only a rope to hang myself. So wills my patron, to whom I have given and devoted myself wholly and entirely; to whom, with body and soul, by virtue of the concluded covenant from which I cannot free myself, I belong! He often made similar speeches, and would have carried them into effect had not someone kept watch over him day and night, as a worthy priest who saw him often at that time testified to me.

In the year 1667, nineteen years later, when his book was to be printed in Venice, Brognoli asked another priest, who was his countryman, whether he was still alive; and this man replied: I believe so, but I have not seen him for a long time; for years now he has lain bound in chains, naked, covered all over with hair, and entirely without sense. For one day, when he, with some of his companions, outside the city, was performing his necromantic circles to summon the demons, and in some respect erred against his art, the spirits rose up against him and beat him with cudgels all over his body, and especially upon the head, so that he was scarcely carried away half dead by his companions; from those blows he afterwards entirely lost the use of his reason, and became more senseless than an animal. Thus had happened to him what I had often foretold him, when I begged and entreated him to return to sound reason.

If one considers more closely this horrid mixture of madness, possession and bewitchment, of hellish humor and mockery and irony, one clearly sees the threads of evil deceit, of wicked infernal arts, and of wild, unbridled passions shining through, out of which a demonically impious deed has woven together this tragic story. \[Page 36\]

It falls into the last times of the Thirty Years' War, in which a dreadful barbarization seized upon almost the whole of European society and brought forth the utmost of vileness and abomination, whose miasmas were then carried about everywhere by the undisciplined armies. It was then also this learned doctor of both laws, and thoroughly instructed theologian, whom the pestilential influence seized, and whom they wove into their mysteries in that cave near Genoa. His associates were sorcerers and malefactors, Manichaeans, Anabaptists, Protestants, but above all atheists. Among these, without doubt, all those higher-order questions that moved the times had been discussed, and had led, by divided paths, out into uncertainty.

Protestantism had first awakened doubt, and carried it through all degrees to heathen pantheism, and finally to self-destruction in atheism. The Anabaptists on their part had pointed to mystical routes in order to attain truth in these matters; the malefactors boasted of a practice founded in a world other than the Christian; the Manichaeans promised to unlock this night-covered world, and so the journey to the Genoese cave was undertaken. That the Manichaeans were the ones who played the principal role in the abjuration of the Christian God and the subsequent admission into the fellowship of the evil prince is already shown by the indications of an ordered hierarchy that shine forth from the whole act. There were nine magicians, that is, Manichaeans, who were present at the rite, carrying pitch torches in their hands. Their hidden chief appears in the cave in human form, but wearing the mask of the Goat of Mendes.

They fall down before him, in the usual fashion paying him homage with the kiss a posteriori. Only the first among them, their bishop, then rises from the midst of those kneeling and brings the novice forward. The Manicheans, as they spread themselves in Italy, had united and ordered themselves under a fully developed hierarchy. From the trial of their adherents which the Inquisition held at the end of the thirteenth century in Ferrara it appears that the sect had bishops in all the principal places --- through the Ferrara, Mantua, Verona, Bergamo, Vicenza districts as far as Romandiola --- several of whom are named, as well as visitators, quaestors and messengers. By the zeal of the Inquisition and the crusades in France the league was broken at the beginning of the fourteenth century, but not exterminated. The ruins withdrew from the light of day and withdrew into the darkness that in any case had been their element; and we still see them so late, in the old holy ninefold of their heads, in that cave, a secret Carbonaria, assembling for recruitment.

Before the seat of the Master the question of the terms of the pact is now discussed. The desire of the one to be received concerns treasures, invisibility, the serviceability of demons at his command. The Master of the Rock agrees, on his part, on the condition that the initiate renounce God and His Church, and firmly believe that there is no other god than him, the demon. This touched directly upon that question earlier debated among the Genoese. "The exclusive godhood of the demon contradicts my reason," replies the novice, refusing to make such a profession. In truth this doctrine could hardly have pleased Manichaeism, because it rested on the denial of all that is spiritual, and would soon have to threaten even Satan himself in his existence. The chief magician, who was regarded as a bishop among the others, therefore stepped forward as mediator; and although he himself professed that doctrine, he permitted the novice to hold to it at his pleasure so long as he seriously acknowledged the duality of the divine being: one invisible who created spiritual things, and another who created the visible, corporeal things. \[Page 37\]

Both, however, are Manichaean doctrine, as Pfellus found in the last half of the eleventh century among the Euchites or Enthusiasts, a Manichaean sect in Thrace. According to his account these took a Father and two Sons as principles. They left the government of the super-world to the Father; of the sons, the younger had the dominion of the heavenly, the elder that of the underworld. In accordance with this threefold principle they themselves again divided into three parts. Some paid divine veneration to both sons at once, because they were, although often not in agreement, nevertheless children of the same father and would once more be received into grace. Others worshipped the younger only as lord of the higher region, without, however, refusing the older his honor, which they did not withhold for fear of harm from his power. Those among them who attained to the highest godlessness entirely renounced the service of that heavenly one and turned all their veneration to the elder, whom they called Satanaki and the firstborn, alienated from the Father, and acknowledged as the author of plants, animals and all composite bodies, together with all corruption and degeneration. To honor him especially highly, they impute to the heavenly all injustice: he envies his brother and persecutes him, who governs the earthly well, with the bitterest hatred, arousing earthquakes, hailstorms and famine; wherefore they, among all other imprecations, also utter that shameful anathema against him. \[Page 38\]

This Satanaki was also present at the initiation in the cave; how much of that was capricious and how much derived from traditionally transmitted, magically visionary practice cannot be determined from the account. Psellus likewise relates: the demons promised gold, possessions and honours, all of which they were in fact unable to provide. To the initiated they often presented many phantasms and fiery displays of light, which they dared to call theoptia or divine visions; and to obtain these they were obliged to undergo every shameful and abominable thing. He then speaks of the solid and liquid excrements of mankind, which they were bound to taste, because that made the demons favourably disposed toward them. He then explains their secret sacrifice. On the evening of the day on which we celebrate our Lord's Passion they would be brought into a house; there, with lights extinguished, all would intermingle without distinction. After the lapse of nine months they would then meet again in the same place. Four days after the birth the children would be taken from their mothers, all their blood drained off, and they would be burned alive on a pyre; the blood was then mixed with the ashes, and with that they contaminated food and drink, and that was their communion. They believe that thereby the symbols impressed on our soul are driven out and obliterated, so that the demons can gain access to it.1) All their deeds and endeavours are indeed directed to making the demons visible to them.

Later he also speaks of some among them who possessed a prophetic spirit. One of these, speaking of him in an assembly of his own people, once said: "Know that a man will be sent against us who will persecute our faith and abolish its customs! He will, like many others, put me also in chains; yet, however much he may toil, it will not succeed in bringing me hence bound to Byzantium." He described me at that time down to the very countenance, clothing and everything; and that at a time when I had not even passed the suburbs of Byzantium. When I had indeed captured him and asked him whence he had his gift of prophecy, at first he would not answer; but finally, forced to speak, he said that he had learned his arts from a wandering Libyan. This man, he related, led him at night to a mountain, made him taste of an herb, then spat into his mouth, anointed his eyes with an ointment, and caused him to see a multitude of demons, among whom he perceived one that flew toward him in the shape of a raven and entered through his mouth into his entrails. From that time until the present day he could look into the future, as often and in all matters as pleased his demon. Only on the days of the Cross and of the Passion, and on the day of the Resurrection, does he never, even if I wish it, reveal anything to me. But when one of the men struck one of them on the mouth, he said to him, "You will pay dearly for this one blow!" and, turning to me, "but you will suffer much misfortune in your body! For the demons whose service you have overthrown are very hostile to you, and have brought upon you dangers which you will not escape unless a power higher than theirs frees you from them." And all came to pass as he had foretold, and I narrowly met death in the many dangers that surrounded me, from which, contrary to expectation, the Redeemer delivered me.

The ways of the Abomination --- on which, in the deep Orient, they knew how to prepare the sacrament of Hell, under sin and homicide, and the bread of the abyss which, whoever has tasted it, attaches him to the nether-realm and, as we heard elsewhere, never lets him recover --- these ways had also been opened in the peninsula of the West; the deep had foamed its venom into the food, and the unhappy Manichaean had sat at its table. Now the trunk of the good, which springs up in man, had not, as if struck by frost, cast off its green leafy adornment; the axe had not cut away its branches and shortened the trunk itself down to the ground: the stump left behind would then still have been able to put forth new shoots. No --- the last root of what was better had been torn up, the last living germ killed; the higher symbols were all extinguished, and to the dreadful night of death that had now fallen the demons had free access; and the seed of evil, buried down in the depths, could now develop freely.

He was not possessed, now, in the manner in which possession is commonly understood --- an involuntary entanglement with the hostile power, therefore bound merely in the body; rather the soul had surrendered itself in full deliberation, and from it the body was then occupied with its full knowledge and will. The bird of darkness had flown down through his opened mouth into the depths of his heart, and there, finding already the culpable inclination for that youth, had fastened itself to it and made it the center of his whole being. Thus it was he himself who had committed the evil deed, while his suspicion clung continually to others; just as he, thinking himself the possessor of the demons, became possessed by them. Precisely because a reversal of his whole being had taken place, no notion of his condition remained to him; because no object, not even God, was present to him by which, through comparison, he might find his bearings. The ground of his condition appeared to him good and right, for he believed himself to be perfectly oriented; he was certain of his salvation in it. Only a small flaw disturbed his happiness --- the supposed enchantment with the youth, to which he endeavored to attach all the contradictions into which his perverse state had entangled him with the proper order of things. When, at night, one abyss within him called to another, and a hundred voices spoke blasphemies and vented their despair, then he found in their fury a relief for his flaming passion, and believed that it merely poured itself out there. The bondage of his body when the physician approached him, the grim mocking laugh that burst from him, and the grief that possessed him --- it was all, as he knew, the consequence of his own doing; his caprice, however, had only surrendered to vicissitudes; another power, which continued itself alone in his will, had made the choice.

This power had bound him with fetters of necessity, and this necessity was not the expression of a power that binds in love under the law of order; but of a violence, hating and destroying in the division of lawlessness, that compelled him to all evil. Thus he was the true canon of a condition that will hereafter meet us more often; a condition that united him intimately with everything that in any way created evil on earth. \[Page 39\]

He therefore attended all the Sabbaths of the brethren, but with the unboundness of a high magnate of the realm, coming and going according to his pleasure, as it pleased him. It was therefore no wonder that Brognoli's efforts failed on an honorable man in whom reason had become counter-reason, conscience an uncertainty, the whole spirit a mere madness. His end, in which, it is to be believed, his comrades took part, was therefore also --- with the complete extinguishing of the last spark of intellect --- the outbreak of a raging beast, which vented itself upon its chain.

#### B. Effects of Judaism on the Art of Witchcraft

The Jews, scattered in the midst of Christendom, and having for so many centuries penetrated and in part overgrown it, necessarily had to exert a historical influence in every sphere, despite the hatred long heaped upon them; and thus even that which here demands our attention could least escape their influence. Talmud and Kabbalah had effected the construction and development of a twofold realm of spirits: opposite the paradise, which rises in seven steps, each placed under the ward of an angel, they had deepened a hell, fashioned pyramidally in Dantesque fashion, pierced by seven streams of fire, and guarded by just as many angels of destruction.

Above all these Satanim or Opponents, Schedim or Desolators, Seirim or Terribles --- the sum of all dark powers --- was to them S'maäl, Satan par excellence; whose Schechina, or feminine part, is called Lilith or the serpent; and all of them together sought only to spread ruin everywhere and to restore the state of Chaos. Samael, the alien god, was a servant of the Most Blessed; but since he has made himself a god, the Most Blessed will in time sweep away the fallen and entirely destroy the impious servant. \[Page 40\]

Just as there are degrees on the holy side, so also on the unclean; and as there man and woman are contained as one there, so also here; and Samael's consort was the serpent; and from the day when this evil serpent, who is the death of the world, persuaded Adam, she obtained dominion over him, until the King Mashiach comes. For by the poison which she hurled upon him, Satan has gained a permanent assault upon man. Great therefore is the power permitted to Satan by God over the world; the Satanim dwell with man and beside him, and mock him; and their purpose is to do him harm, and they pursue his blood.

Not only does Satan draw to himself those who voluntarily surrender to him; he also persecutes the pious, and disturbs their well-being by the Ruach Thesaṣṣith, the spirit of confusion or possession. The man in whom such an evil spirit has entered does everything he does and says by the inspiration of the evil spirit that is in him. Thus it was also with the serpent in the case of Eve: all that she did and spoke came from Samael. In the city of Ferrara a Jewish woman was thus possessed; she fell into a stupor, and a voice issued from her throat while her lips were without movement, and the voice spoke. In the time of Luria there was a widow into whom a Ruach had entered, and it inflicted extraordinary torments upon her. People went to her, spoke with her, and received answers to what they asked. The relatives of the woman came to Loriah, and begged him that he would drive the Ruach out of the woman. Loriah sent his pupil R. Chaim Vital, and gave him certain holy names with him, and told him what intention he was to observe in the matter. He also commanded him that he should pronounce over the Ruach the small and great ban, and should by force drive it out. When R. Chaim came to the woman, she turned her face away from him. R. Chaim said: Why do you turn away? The Ruach answered: I cannot look you in the face. Then R. Vital commanded that it must turn around, which immediately happened. He now asked the spirit: who are you? whereupon it related its former criminal life. It said it had formerly been a Jew, and had already been wandering in the world for twenty‑five years, incessantly pursued by three angels of destruction. Vital further asked: who gave it permission to enter the woman? The Ruach said: I was in the house when the woman rose in the morning and wanted to strike a fire. When the tinder would not catch, she became angry and threw the tinderbox out of her hands in rage and said: "Go to Satan!" From this word "Satan" I obtained permission to enter her. Although the woman sinned through the sin of unbelief, and did not believe in the Exodus from Egypt, yet the Ruach had no opportunity to enter her until she, in anger, mentioned the name "Satan."

As the good service is directed toward purification and sanctification and the restoration of the original harmony, so opposed to it is an evil service, directed to the unclean and dark --- the discord of that harmony. This demonic service reaches its height when a person, with full will, delivers his soul in a formal covenant to Satan; keeps a personal intercourse with him and his followers; at appointed times delights himself with them by dances, orgies and other excesses; and now he and Satan serve one another mutually. For it is known that all sorcerers and sorceresses make a covenant with the Shed, and deliver their soul to it.

##### Specific Tales of Jewish Sorcery

\[Page 41\]

In the magic books of Ashnidat we find that those who wish to practise sorcery should stand by a burning light, or in a place where the Kliphath can see the man's shadow. They should say words ordered for that sorcery, and call the Unclean by their unclean names; and should appoint their shadow for those whom they have called; and should declare that they submit themselves to their will for their service. Such a man goes forth from the dominion of God, and yields his spirit to the unclean side. And by the magic words which he utters, when he invites the unclean spirits to his shadow, two Ruchin appear; and they arrange themselves in his shadow, in the form of men, and are contained therein, and communicate to him matters in order to do evil, sometimes also to perform good. Thus is the order of the evil side: one prepares a table for them, with food and drink and magical works, and makes smoke before the table. Then all the unclean Ruchin assemble, and make known what the sorcerers desire.

All kinds of witchcraft in the world are connected and proceed from the ancient serpent, which is the unclean spirit; therefore all the witchcrafts of the world are called serpent‑arts. Some sorcerers also transform themselves into the shape of animals and harm people; or traverse great distances in a short time. With them one also makes use of darker means, especially salves made from certain herbs and oils.

There are also women who have made a pact with the Shedim, and at certain times meet with them, dance with them, and attend those spirits which appear to them as bucks. In many states such women are put to death; for although their crime consists in no external, but only in an internal, imaginative act, the death-penalty is nevertheless just, because they have wholly surrendered themselves to Satan.

It also happens, that when a man dreams, female Ruchin come to him, excite themselves with him, solicit themselves from him, and afterwards bear children. In the same way male Ruchin come to women and impregnate them, so that they beget Ruchin. Great also is the power of the evil eye. For it rules over a thing which takes place with pomp and noise, even when it is brought about by a miracle. The Ruchin do not all belong, however, to the more wicked orders; there are also elemental spirits, namely such as consist of the element of fire, invisible but inclined to good, the salamanders of the Middle Ages; others formed of fire and air, the sylphs of that order, likewise invisible, and wise and good. The third class consists of fire, air and water, at times perceptible to the senses, their life being of a plant-like kind, the undines of the middle period; finally the fourth order, in which a substance of earth is added, visible and of a more mineral nature, belonging with the foregoing to the side of Samael. They all dwell in the upper, inner circles of the elements, and know the near future; their food is the incense with which they are fumigated; according to the fineness of their elemental body is also the degree of their spiritual rank.

From all these citations, which reach down from the beginning of the 17th century to the older times of the Zohar, it follows how, besides possessions, also the whole witch- and sorcery-craft, the entire visionary and operative black magic, the incubus and the succubus, and likewise natural magic, were perfectly well known to the Jews; and that all these black arts, entirely analogous to those that prevailed in Christianity, developed themselves --- which of course proceeds from the commonness of the root, but also testifies to the continuing contact of both.

##### False Jewish Messiahs and the Demonic Influences

\[Page 42\]

The people of the Jews have, by temperament, been a mystical people before many others; and this temperament has likewise decisively helped their reputation as the chosen people in ancient times. Such a bent made it possible to lead this people out of bondage into a conquered fatherland, and to hold them there for so many centuries, bound under theocratic forms; and the whole history of this realm, and even its fall into death and horror, amid the turmoil of every passion, bears witness to this mystical, full-blooded vein which runs through its otherwise harshness and obstinacy. But even after the judgment had come, and the nation was scattered, this side of their tribal character did not fade; and it especially manifested itself whenever their hope for a coming Redeemer moved their whole mind in its inmost depths. When that "son of the star," Bar Chochéba, for the first time awakened and deceived that hope in them, the enthusiasm for their new king burst forth into bright flames, which could only be extinguished by a bloodbath worse than that which Titus had wrought among them.

In the year 432 that other Moses appeared on the island of Crete and proclaimed that he had been sent to earth a second time in order to lead Israel again into the land of their fathers, on dry feet through the divided waves of the sea. The people, seized by enthusiasm, abandoned their trades, gave away their property, and followed their leader to the seashore; and there, at his command, without wavering in their faith, crowds from the heights cast themselves into the sea and were swallowed by the waves. The survivors explained the calamity that had befallen them by saying that it had been a ruach from the dark side, one of the demons of Samael, that had seduced them.

It was just the same with all the others; and when, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, Sabbatai Zevi in the Orient proclaimed himself the son of David and the long-expected Redeemer, Nathan of Gaza --- who had become clairvoyant, pronouncing past things of which he could not have known by natural means; who saw visions and prophesied of the future --- declared him such. Soon prophets and prophetesses rose up in Samaria, Adrianople, Thessalonica, Constantinople and many other places: men, women, youths and girls, even children, were seized by the prophetic spirit. They fell suddenly to the ground as if epileptic, had violent convulsions, and in that state uttered, both in Hebrew and in Aramaic --- languages of which they had previously not understood a word --- wonderful and extraordinary things, both long past and yet to come. Every such prophecy concluded with the words: "Sabbatai Zevi is the true Messiah, from the house of David, to whom crown and kingdom are given!" \[Page 43\]

Even the opponent Pechina, whom he had encountered and to whom he foretold that he would yet live to see his own daughters bear children for him, had to witness the fulfillment of the word. For when that man once returned to his house, he found his two daughters festively adorned, and they spoke in the two languages which they had never understood, about the new Messiah. Also Moses Servil, a highly respected, sensible man who had been his renounced enemy, suddenly found himself driven to exhort the people to repentance because the redemption of Israel through Sabbatai was near; and at the same time he was given the gift of reading every person's committed sins from their brow. In the end all this enthusiasm found itself sadly betrayed, when the Messiah converted to Islam.

This impetuous, inflammable people --- which, once kindled, burns long afterward --- had now, after it had misconceived its historical vocation and missed the solution of the problem assigned to it, the fate of seeing itself given over to the captivity of the nations for a third time; this time, so that it, to use the expression of Pope Innocent III, as "the living witness of the true Christian faith" he led his life among them. In Germany they were regarded as chamber-servants of the realm, over whom the emperor exercised authority; likewise in the other kingdoms of the Christian West. The powerful vassals in every case had parcelled the unhappy people out among themselves, and, treating them as serfs and, by the strict letter of the law, stripping them of all personal, property and contractual rights, had added them to their domains. Though the popes, especially in earlier times --- Innocent II and III, Alexander III and Gregory IX --- urged leniency; though the bishops sheltered them against inhuman violences; and the synods regulated their relations with Christians: they served hard bondage, and each year hatred would sharpen anew against them when the observance of the days of suffering recurred, and the people, prone to merriment, allowed themselves blasphemies against the mysteries, or sometimes even ascribed them to the Jews.

##### Jewish Treachery

As compensation to the oppressed, the riches of Christendom were allotted to them; even the church treasures were not excepted; the day was to come when the consecrated gold would be handed over into their hands by its keepers. The fulfillment of this promise was bound up with the magnetic attraction that exists between metal and genuine avarice, and with the sober cunning and industry of this class of people. Thus they always succeeded in getting hold of the largest portion of the circulating money supply, and they continued to practise usury with it at the enormous interest rates customary for the time and country. The joy in ever-increasing possessions made the lot of the oppressed easier. The mighty, for whose account they in part lent and acquired, protected them; but the people, who felt themselves doubly drained by lords and by servants, burned more and more with fury against the arts of usury; moreover with envy and ill will against the rising prosperity of the ever-multiplying foreigners, who, like parasitic plants, entwined and sucked away the native stock. \[Page 44\]

Over generations the storm slowly gathered, single outbreaks from time to time announced the approaching catastrophe; at last, when the Crusades put the people into the deepest inner agitation, the whirlwind burst forth with fury. Like lightning the persecution suddenly fell upon the people devoted to destruction; in France, Spain, England, Italy, up the Rhine, down the Danube, in Bohemia and Hungary, the masses rose against the unfortunate as if by common agreement; and robbery, arson and murder raged against them everywhere. In English York, somewhat later, about five hundred of them who had fled to the castle were slaughtered --- their wives and children --- and were burned with the fortress; the petty nobility around, who owed them money, caused all the writs in the cathedral to go up in smoke, a burnt offering to the Lord. \[Page 45\]

They were driven away everywhere, but compassion and their gold soon opened the gates to them again; Louis VII in France tolerated them anew, and Peter the Venerable, who had been abbot of Cluny from 1120 (sic) and was a man of note in his time, who knew the Talmud well and had had the Koran translated in Spain, could urge this king to employ their riches against the power of the Saracens. "What I say to you, O King, concerning the Jews," says the abbot, "is well known to all. Not by diligent tilling of the soil, not by lawful service in war, not by any honourable and useful occupation do they fill their barns with fruits, their cellars with wine, their sacks with money, their chests with gold and silver; but solely from that which they win from Christians by deceit, which they buy from thieves at a bad price." If a robber breaks into a Christian church anywhere, if he brazenly carries off candlesticks, jugs, censers, even the holy cross or the consecrated chalices; then he avoids the Christians, seeks out the Jews, and, enjoying accursed security with them, he not only has his den of thieves in their midst, but sells what was stolen from the holy Church to the synagogue of Satan. The vessels that contained the Body and the Blood of Christ he hands over to those who killed that Body and shed His blood; who then, when He walked among mortals, did Him every outrage, and now, seated in the Majesty of the Godhead, do not cease to persecute Him with their blasphemies. Even those holy vessels themselves, which they preserve, as formerly the Chaldeans preserved theirs, remain therefore --- though they themselves have no feeling --- not free from reproach; and they are, as I have often heard from trustworthy men, put to a use which is already a horror to imagine, and an abomination to speak of.

But that is not enough! So that such dishonorable theft and the Jewish fence might be secured, an old, truly demonic law, issued by Christian princes, has prevailed: that if a church utensil, and what is worse, a holy vessel, is found in the possession of a Jew, he shall not be bound to return the church theft, nor to betray the unworthy robber.

Those were burning words, words of reproach for the powerful of the time who, like William II of England, accepted gold from Jewish fathers to deter by threats and persuasions their sons who wished to become Christians; flaming words which, kindling in every heart, explain --- if they never justify --- the barbarity with which passion then acted in that age. The Talmud tells the people of Israel: the shooting lights that fall nightly from the stars are the tears which Elohim twice daily weeps over the captivity of His people; every morning, for the same reason, He roars like a lion, stamping the firmament with His feet. Like a turtledove He utters a cry of lament each day, rocking His head and crying, "Woe! woe upon me! that I have made my house a wilderness, broken and burned my temple, and scattered my sons among the nations." A people that in this way carried all its pride into its humiliation, and laid its sorrow in the bosom of its God, must deeply rage over the ill‑treatment and the scorn it endured, and a violent reaction must kindle in the sulphur‑fields of its passion. Defenceless and long unaccustomed to courage, as the Jews had grown in their servility, this reaction could not rise openly, eye for eye, against their persecutors; it was forced to choose secret ways in order to strike more safely. Hence, from that time forth, the legends of poisoning wells and running waters; the legends of sacrament‑theft, to assuage wrath against the substitute of the Crucified; and finally, in order to wound those hateful oppressors in the depths of their hearts, the seizing of their children to make of them victims of vengeance.

The oldest example of such a robbery appears to be that of the boy William of Norwich, whom the English Jews in the year 1144, in the ninth year of King Stephen, thus abducted and cruelly put to death in Passion Week; to which the French, following this precedent, in the year 1171 likewise sacrificed a boy at Easter in Blois, and were therefore delivered to the fire by Count Theobald; and in the year 1179, when those of Paris crucified the boy Richard of Pontoise. In the year 1181 news again came over from England: the Jews had treated the boy Robert at St. Edmund in just the same way as in 1160 under Henry with the one from Gloucester; the great uprising of 1180 was the consequence of this.

In all these cases, however, there was no formal investigation; the murdered were venerated by the people as saints, and the miracles performed by their relics served as a guarantee for everything that legend told --- a guarantee which was not in all cases irrefragable, since the people brought their own excitement into the matter; and this excitement probably sometimes even produced miracles at human remains, about which the Inquisition later had to pronounce the sentence of condemnation.

The courtiers now told, at the coronation of Philip Augustus, to the young king in their levity: in his father's time the Jews in Paris had every year sacrificed a boy --- as in this case Robert of Pontoise --- to the derision of the Christians; and they were thereupon arrested throughout France, their Christian creditors were released from every debt, and then they were all expelled from the realm, and their movable goods awarded to the king; a decree which, however, was revoked in 1108, because it was felt with regret that one had killed the hen that laid the golden eggs. The Jews, on their side, answered this harshness at Brienne by accusing a Christian of homicide and by taking a bankrupt peasant --- whom the local countess had delivered to them --- and crowning him with thorns, beating him through the town with sticks, and then hanging him; for which 82 of them had to make atonement by death by fire.

From then on the boy-murders recur throughout the whole course of the thirteenth century. When Henry III in England had driven the Jews by his exactions to the utmost, so that they themselves asked to emigrate with their goods, their bitterness produced in the year 1255 the outrage at Lincoln. They had, as the chronicles of the country relate, abducted the nine-year-old boy Hugh from his children's play into the house of Jopinus, there starved and scourged him for 26 days, cut open the wings of his nose, cut off his upper lip, and smashed in his teeth; then stuck him all over the body with needles, and finally killed him with a lance-wound. The body had been drawn up from a well; numerous miracles had strengthened the suspicion against the Jews, who were arrested. John of Lessinan conducted the trial, and since their chief rabbi Jopinus had been promised his life, he confessed everything. He was nevertheless dragged to death behind a horse; 18 suffered the same death later in London, and the remaining 60 escaped the same fate only through the intercession of the Dominicans and Richard, the king's brother. \[Page 46\]

On the Rhine, in the year 1287 at Oberwesel, they seized the fourteen‑year‑old youth Werner while he was carrying earth out of the cellar of one of their houses; they had hanged him with his head downward in order to get possession of the Host that he had taken before his work. When that, however, did not succeed, they put him to death after various torments and cast him far from the place into the fields. Although Emperor Rudolph, and through him the Archbishop of Mainz, took the Jews under their protection, the nobility of Swabia --- already inflamed by another murder which they had committed in 1271 on a seven‑year‑old girl at Pforzheim --- rose up mightily against them, and several thousands lost their lives. Earlier, already in 1256, Emperor Frederick II had ordered a formal inquiry into the repeated accusations of murder, but it had led to no result.

Mahometanism, in its essence a Judaism driven up to the highest abstraction, stripped of the abandoned Messiah‑idea, had from its origin exhibited certain sympathetic relations to Judaism. Jews had cooperated with Nestorian heretics in the composition of the Koran; Jews had already before the Prophet founded realms among the Ishmaelites, and the Prophet had only reluctantly renounced the idea of winning them over amicably, and only against his will subdued them by force of arms. In Spain, since the conquest by the Saracens, they were continually accused of collusion with the enemy of Christendom. In the year 1321 letters were said to have been found in France in which the King of Granada reported to the Jew Samson that he had loaded three pack animals with riches and poisons to poison the waters with them, and had sworn to them as reward to carry them back into the Promised Land. When, then, in 1348 the great death began throughout Europe, and only the Jews were spared, this suspicion seemed to be confirmed; and a terrible persecution again burst forth against those who, it was thought, had sworn the death of Christendom.

When later in Spain the realm of Islam came to an end, the Jews were again involved in its fall. After the middle of the century it became notorious that in Hispalis there had been opened a Jewish propaganda directed against Christians; and in secret assemblies, in the midst of apostates, terrible blasphemies were uttered. Two inquisitors were therefore sent there in 1482 to investigate the matter. To their edict, which allowed forty days for the apostates to return, 17,000 of them yielded; the others were sought out, and had either to pay with their lives or, confined in sacks, to do penance. But when Granada fell; when fears of the contagion spreading among the people grew ever stronger; when Jews in the town of La Guardia were accused of having stolen the Sacrament of the Eucharist and committed sacrilege upon it; when they were said to have nailed a stolen child to a cross --- then, in the year 1492, the edict went forth that all Jews must leave Spain within three months under penalty of death; their goods they might sell and take with them. An enormous terror fell upon them, and by the hundred thousands they went over to Africa, Greece, Romania, Egypt and Babylonia; others fled to Portugal, France, Italy, Germany; many perished in shipwreck or at the hands of pirates: it was a calamity greater than that which they suffered in the time of Titus and Hadrian, and it even stirred the compassion of Christians toward them.

In the century that ran from 1394, when Charles VI likewise again drove them out of France, to this catastrophe, we again find the child‑murders reappearing with force, and now by means of judicial inquiry taking on a more documentary character. Outstanding among them, above many others, is the story of the boy Simon, who was born in Trento in the year 1472 of poor parents, and in the year 1475 found his death at the hands of the Jews. At the instigation of the old Moses, who was reputed to be a seer, knowing the day and hour of the Messiah's coming, their elders---Tobias, Angelus and Samuel, in whose house the synagogue was---had resolved to sacrifice a Christian boy at the Easter festival. But since their servants refused the plotted seizure of such a one, Tobias at last undertook it himself, his medical profession giving him the best opportunity to execute the commission. The boy was brought in, hidden for a time in the synagogue, and on the appointed day was most cruelly murdered. The corpse was concealed by the murderers for some time, because the elders searched everywhere for the child with armed men; and finally, as the danger pressed all too near upon the awakened suspicion, it was thrown into the nearby flowing water, and the discovery was then reported to the authorities.

The bishop ordered the most exacting inquiry; the Schultheiß Johannes and the prefect Jacob de Sporo were appointed as judges; they summoned Archangelus Baldin of Trento, Math(eus) Tiberinus of Brescia, Chr(istus) de Fatis of Turlach, as physicians and surgeons, to report on the condition of the corpse and its wounds, and the report sharpened the grounds for suspicion. The Jews were brought in; they chose the most eminent jurists at the University of Padua as their defenders; their statements contradicted one another, torture finally forced the full confession which---being found to agree completely with the circumstances (one had, for example, also discovered the hidden flask containing the collected blood)---now resulted in the judicial condemnation of the proved perpetrators, the expulsion of the Jews from Trento, and the transformation of the synagogue into a chapel of the miracle‑working murdered one. All this is reported by the physician M. Tiberinus in an authentic letter to the senate and citizens of Brescia. The deed had taken place on the night of 23 March; the sentence was executed on 21 June; in the three months between the rumor ran through all Italy. \[Page 47\]

On 22 April the Doge of Venice, P. Mocenigo, issued a mandate; it was believed that the rumor of a boy murdered by the Jews had been invented only for certain purposes; he, however, wished that the Jews should dwell undisturbed and secure in his lands; he therefore forbade any change in their condition, and prohibited preachers and other persons from stirring up the people against them. That was without doubt worthy, just and sensible; but when meanwhile the trial had taken its course and led to the result above mentioned, then a second decree of 12 August of the same year revoked that judgment, permitted the carrying about of the images of the martyr, allowed preachers to treat the deed from the pulpit, but even then forbade them to incite the people against the Jews; because those who were not guilty could not be struck by the punishment. \[Page 48\]

In September the magistrate of Trento wrote a letter to Venice --- still to be found in the archive of St. Franciscus de Vinea --- in which he reports the affair in complete agreement with Tiberianus, and among other things says: "how the judges, although they were deeply moved by the murder, and well recognized the deceit and guile of the Jews, their cunning, their hatred against the Church, and the corrupting power of their gold, nevertheless dealt with them so moderately, with such gravity and such leniency, that whoever runs through the records will rather complain of excessive indulgence and tenderness than of severity. Torture, it is true, finally wrested the truth from them; but after Tobias had first confessed, all, as with one mouth, confirmed the matter with regard to place, time, circumstances, and those who had been present. It is moreover not the first time that such things have occurred." 1) These and the immediately following, still entirely unedited documents are taken from the work: De Cultu sancti Simonis pueri Tridentini, et martyris apud veteres in --- (title in the Crela sacra) sive de episcopis utriusque Ritus graeci et latini in Insula Venet. 1755. In the appendix five shorter writings of the author Flaminius Cornelins, senator in Venice. The first document p. 63. 2) Ibid. p. 67. Görres, chrihl. Mystie. 1v. 2. 5

Since time immemorial the same thing, it says, has occurred in Speyer on the Rhine, likewise in Dortmund in Westphalia, in Maastricht in the duchy of Guelders. In the place Dutsch, between Cologne and Aachen, two boys were likewise sacrificed; two others in the town of Penigen in Swabia; in Upper Bavaria in Amberg one; in the Palatinate at Alzey another; in Endingen in the margraviate of Baden two, whose parents were also murdered; recently moreover the whole of Christendom has learned what occurred in Sicily." 3) As the multiplying miracles in the meantime further spread the cult of the murdered boy, a breve of Pope Sixtus IV of 10 October 1475 forbade this beatification until the proper inquiry before the papal throne, to which the decision alone belongs, should take place; at the same time taking the Jews under the protection of the Church; and the Doge had commanded that this breve be obeyed in his territory. Several cardinals and other prelates were then appointed commissioners for the examination of the process records; and after these had thoroughly examined the whole business, on 20 June 1478 the entire legal procedure was completely approved as irreproachable; and the veneration was then permitted, although no breve concerning it remains.

Five years had hardly passed since this murder-story in the neighboring Trentine territory, when the Senate of Venice had occasion, in its own jurisdiction at Portubuffaleto in the province of Friuli, to learn by experience that the tales which formerly circulated among the people about such matters were by no means unfounded. The Jews Servadeus and Moyses had set about Jakob, the son of Simon of Cologne, and another of the same name: to procure for them, at Easter time, a boy; and they had, following the suggestion, in Treviso found Sebastian Novello of Bergamo, a seven-year-old poor child, and persuaded him to follow them to Portubuffaleto; where then, on Maundy Thursday, they all together killed him. The perpetrators were brought to Venice, the trial was conducted in all lawful form, and the condemned were then burned on the Piazza San Marco, between the two columns. 5) According to others, five years later, on 5 April 1485, in Marostica, in the territory of Vicenza, the boy Lorenz suffered the same death; and the Jews were on that account expelled forever from that territory. \[Page 49\]

News came then from the Orient that they had bought a Christian slave from the sea‑robbers in Pontus and crucified him; and in Crete the syndic Gradonicus had reported that the people there, in derision, had crucified lambs. (1) About the same time, in the year 1486, according to the chronicles in Regensburg, six children were sacrificed in that manner. In the year 1540 the four‑year‑old boy Michael, according to Rader's Bavaria sancta III. B., was slaughtered at Easter in Heitingen; while in the year 1579 it was reported from Lithuania how a boy Sinnat and a girl Elisabeth, both seven years old, in the village Punie lost their lives at the hands of the Jew Joachim Sinerlovicz, with the consent of others.

In the year 1650, still, at Cadana in Bohemia on 11 March, the four‑year‑old boy Matthias was killed, to whom Ferdinand III caused a monument to be erected. Since then the matter was lost sight of until it reappeared in our days in Damascus --- a welcome opportunity for the newspapers and journals to chatter over the subject with their accustomed shallowness and vapidity, making use of the usual phrasemongering, and then to dismiss it as finally disposed of. But these murder‑stories had so deeply impressed themselves on the popular consciousness that they became the subject of popular song; and the strain beginning:

"The rain rins doun through Mirry‑land toune, Sae dois it doune the Pa: Sae dois the lads of Mirry‑land toune; Duhan they play at the ba' . . ."

is a relic of that popular poetry, in which "Mirryland toune" is very likely Milan, and "the Pa" denotes the Po.

In all these mutually provoking outbreaks of fury --- the wolf‑like rage of Christians against the Jews, and the hyena‑like reactions of the latter against the former --- the paw of the tearing beast that sleeps in the breast of man was only made visible; Hell had, by its breath, exhaled nothing but horrors, and the demonic had visibly entered the world. The imagination of the peoples, kept in constant excitement by the oft‑dreamed and sometimes palpable nearness of the outrage, accustomed itself not to recoil before the most monstrous; and, thus poisoned at its inmost root, brooded further upon the abominations with which it had become familiar. In this way blasphemies practised against all that is holy, the atrocious mistreatments of the plundered sacred things, the murderous deeds against children carried out under the most revolting circumstances, penetrated even into the Sabbath --- things that occur all too often to be other than rooted in the morbid condition of imagination of an infected age. \[Page 50\]

To the frequently recurring tales of poisoned wells were then joined those of the power of poison‑brewers extended also over the other elements, of weather‑making, and of the devastation of the vegetable world. One knows what power the Jews have ascribed to the Schem‑Hamphoraſch: it not only unlocks the word of man, but makes below the voice of animals intelligible, above the speech of ministering angels and the demons of the abyss; it makes the world of thought accessible and opens the view into the future. He who knew how to bind the Word could create a new world; Moses worked his wonders by it, the prophets prophesied by it, even Jesus --- who learned it from Jehoshua in Egypt --- brought forth wondrous things by it. It embraced not only, like the name Jehova, God's essence within itself, but at the same time also his omnipotence, omniscience, truth, righteousness, and mercy; it was written at the entrance of the Temple of Jerusalem on the stone that Jacob had anointed with oil; but in the burning of the Temple in the time of the Romans it was lost together with the stone; and the later Jews devised substitutes for it, and their legend has much to praise about what their rabbis effected with them. It is the symbol of the higher mysticism and prophetic gift as it existed in earlier Israel, but it retreated with the first captivity, and with the beginning of Christianity it was wholly lost; whereupon deceitful human contrivances and wicked witchcraft took its place.

##### Jewish Magic

All branches of the demonic arts have flourished merrily among the Jews: the interpreters of dreams, rabdomancy, casting lots and interpreting signs, the Iyur, astrology, amulets, the teraphim and necromancy. Everything at all times found its cultivation among them, and even today in the Orient Jewish women prepare love potions for the wives of the harem. The legend of the Jewish Faust accordingly runs through all the centuries of the modern era. The rabbi J. Scheda already boasts in the Sohar how much artistic skill he learned from a demon, a circumstance from which he also obtained his name. The Jew Sedechias, who lived in the time of Louis the Pious, had --- the chroniclers tell --- set himself the task of convincing people of the existence of the elementary spirits, as the Kabbalists interpreted them. He therefore commanded them to show themselves visibly. They did so in all their splendor, and one saw in the air a wonderful spectacle. Beings in human form showed themselves, arranged as if in battle order, now moving in good formation, now standing quietly under arms, or encamped beneath splendid pavilions. Sometimes they had embarked in air-ships of wondrous construction, and the fleet then sailed, driven by gentle winds, through the blue. \[Page 51\]

That was the same phenomenon that one has so often seen elsewhere, e.g. in the Scottish Highlands. Thus Walker relates, for example: In the year 1686, during the months of June and July, a large number of people were assembled at the Croftfoord ferry, two miles below Lanark, on the Clyde; they saw trees and the ground covered with caps, hats, swords and weapons. Armed men marched in order down to the water's edge; one troop met another; they passed through one another, crossed, then sat down and vanished, and others then took their places. I myself went three afternoons in succession, and as far as I could see there were among the assembled two who saw, always one who did not see; and although I myself saw nothing, all those who were in my position could not fail to perceive the fear and terror of the seers. Beside me stood one who said: "A pack of damned herren and sorcerers, who have the second sight; the devil rides them, that I see!" At once, however, a complete change came over all the features of his face, and such fear and trembling seized him as any one of the women I saw there; and the exclamation followed: "O all of you who see nothing, judge not; for I tell you, it is all true, and manifest to all who are not stone-blind!" The seers described meanwhile the appearance of the pieces of ordnance, their length and their caliber; the sword-hilts, whether they were narrow or triangular, or furnished with Highland tanged blades, likewise the points of the black or blue caps. And all who saw such things beheld, wherever they might look, everywhere a cap and a sword in the way. I have hitherto tried in vain to discover a foundation for this latter circumstance.

What occurred here in Scotland is the same as what happened a thousand years earlier in France; only that here the cabalist Sedechias was on the scene, who explained to the seers their visions out of the elemental spirits of Jewish doctrine; and the people at once connected the matter with Magonia and the air-ships of that mythical land, which, with Lombardic sorcerer‑poisons, ruined his crops. This same Sedechias, moreover, was the Jewish Faust of the Carolingian era, and Trithemius relates of him that he threw a man into the air, cut him into pieces, and then restored him whole and sound; also that, before all the spectators, he swallowed a cart of hay with horse and man. At the end of the 13th century the Rabbi Fechiel, a great cabalist of his time, was summoned to the French court. The Jews revered him as a saint, but the Parisians shunned him as a magician. It was said that he worked every night by the light of an inextinguishable lamp; the people gathered at his house to disturb his sorcery. Then he struck with a large hammer upon a nail; immediately the earth opened and swallowed the intruders. --- This expresses the popular notion of the Jews' magical powers, which remained the same in the centuries that followed. Rabbi Chanina had, he said, bought from an elderly man a toad for eighty florins in two silver vessels, from which he learned the law of Moses, the seventy languages of the peoples, as well as the languages of birds and four‑footed beasts. J. Karro had made use of a spirit for the study of the Mishnah. Rabbi Elias of Worms, Isaac Hünerfänger, Rabbi Levi of Moravia, Naphtali Lohen of Frankfurt, and others were later called great sorcerers; in the guise of a boy, of an eagle, of a raven the spirit had initiated them into the secret science. Often, therefore, the Jews in large numbers were suspected of sorcery; that Chanina was accordingly burned alive; in Ascalon, on one day, eighty Jewish women were hanged by Simeon ben Sehetah for magical poisoning; Thuringia likewise expelled the Jews precisely on the accusation of witchcraft.

Since the Kabbalah enjoyed such great repute, it was natural that the Jews gave themselves to it with all zeal; but, moreover, the persecution they suffered in that period had to lead them over to their demonic side. If they succeeded in gaining allies in the realm of spirits, they could then easily put an end to the oppressive supremacy of the Christians, and take vengeance for the outrages which they had to endure from them; not to speak of the hidden treasures over which such princes of spirits presided. According to the tradition of the Sohar, the eagle had already brought to King Solomon the two fallen angels who dwelt below in the deep abyss practising sorcery, and taught it to everyone who desired it; and he had learned many hidden things from them. Sacrifices offered to Samael that he should not accuse the chosen people before God on the Day of Atonement were, in any case, already customary. (3) The disposition to every form of ecstasy was, as we have seen, likewise highly developed in that people; their dispersion over all parts of the world brought them into contact with every centre of the art of magic, especially among the Saracens, and above all in the northwest of Africa, among the Moroccans.

The wound of suffered evils burned without ceasing; the perpetration of so many crimes in reaction made them fear nothing; shall we then wonder that the black art in that time found numerous practitioners among this people, and that the literature of magic books is especially attached to the Jews? The Jews, however, were then the general leaseholders of the princes: their revenues, customs and taxes passed through Jewish hands; they were the money-changers from whom all the powerful borrowed; often officials, in order to give weight to their business, and in conducting it protected by special rights. Early already they had also appropriated the medical profession to themselves, and while this profession sharpened its gaze into the nature of things, it also increased their influence on Christian society. \[Page 52\]

Under circumstances black-artists and alchemists for themselves --- whatever they were, both against and at times also for the Christians, who in any case were already standing on a well-known foundation in their doctrine of spirits --- and thus Judaism likewise furnished a well-spun thread to the web of sorcery of those times; as also the weavers themselves placed the Jewish mark in the note attached to the loom.

#### C. The Arrival of the Gypsies

About the year 1417, in the time of Emperor Sigismund, a people of about 3,000 souls migrated into Moldavia; there settling near Szesava, and soon strengthened by those who followed, spreading over Wallachia, Transylvania and Hungary; and the king soon granted them, in written letters, the right to settle around the royal towns and on the royal domains. They called themselves Zincalo, contracted in the plural to Cales, "black men," or Chai, also Romano; at times also Sinti, thereby pointing to India, from whence they had immigrated. This account found confirmation in the language they spoke, the Romany, which takes its foundation from the Samserida and has appropriated many Persian, Slavic and modern Greek roots; which then led the English to search in India for the tribe from which this people had been derived; in consequence of which they recognized, among the native aborigines in the North-Indian mountains, the sought-for root. The strangers, for their part, declared at that time: at first they had migrated from Little Egypt or Chali, where they had previously lived, until, being granted to an enemy of God, they were driven back.

They were thence driven away. For a Pharaoh of the land had, it is said, overcome all the peoples of the world, and finally, in his pride, challenged God himself and his heavenly host to battle. God, however, refusing the challenge, to punish him opened a wide cave in the side of a mountain, and a storm-wind then blew the Pharaoh with his host into that abyss, which thereupon closed over them. Whoever now on St. John's night approaches the mountain, hears the king with his army ever singing and sounding. But since the Pharaoh had thus vanished, all the kings and peoples who had previously obeyed his realm rose up against it; and easily conquered the defenceless people, drove out the vanquished, and scattered them over the whole world. \[Page 53\]

They were therefore also driven out, and they called themselves on that account Chat, the people of Chal; or in Hungary Pharaoh Nepet, people of the Pharaoh. Thus they belonged to the raging host, and were in the retinue of the overbearing Ashen‑king Sesostris; but when God overthrew the proud and shut him up in the Egyptian Horus‑mountain, when his rule overthrew the old heathenism, then they were expelled, and the old Tannhäuser went to Rome to obtain from the Pope absolution for his sins. They were therefore driven from their old dwelling-place as the consequence of a religious struggle; and if one considers that some dim notions of the transmigration of souls remained to them amid their religious indifference --- a doctrine which is found only in Buddhism --- then the great wars of the Buddhists with the Brahmins may easily have been the occasion of their expulsion.

From their original Indian homeland they then probably passed over Persia, where Ferdoussi already mentions them in the eleventh century; and then into Little Egypt, probably the Delta, later settling among the pictish and they may perhaps have traversed Asia along the same route which in primeval times the Indians followed, who, according to the Chronicle of Eusebius, migrated into the Nile‑land. There they still live under the name of the Ghaste, and from there have spread through North Africa; Leo the African seems to mention them under the name Zingari, as plunderers of the caravans from Agades to Bornu; and the Dar‑Buschi‑Fals or fortune‑tellers in Morocco, who speak their own language distinct from the Shilha and from Arabic, probably likewise belong to their root. \[Page 54\]

In the same way, as they passed through Asia, hordes were left everywhere; and while there the whole manners and customs of certain tribes, the Luri for example, recall them, swarms of them perhaps turned northwards via Astrakhan and spread into Russia. From Egypt the flights of these migratory birds then set out over Syria and Asia Minor on their migration to the third part. Crossing the Bosphorus, they first spread in the Byzantine realm; the whole Hæmus range from Abydos to Philippopolis gained from them the name Tschenghe Balkan; and from there they filled Bulgaria, probably incorporating from their contact with the local peoples Greek, Slavic and Wallachian roots into their language. After they had obtained a safe‑conduct from Emperor Sigismund in Hungary, and thus traversed all Germany to the North Sea, a division actually went via Bohemia and Switzerland in the year 1422 to Rome, to obtain the same from the Pope for the whole of Christendom. Since they, it seems, were at least not refused, they were thenceforth regarded as those on whom the Pope himself had imposed a seven‑year pilgrimage as penance; they were therefore spared and honored as poor itinerants, and from there spread over all the lands of Europe, as far as Spain; where they are called by all the peoples through whose lands they gradually passed the names Moors, Little Egyptians, Bohemians and Germans, and are traced back to Tatars, Persians, Cilicians and Nubians.

A wild, coarse people --- thus these Gypsies appeared to the chroniclers of that time, setting out for booty and carrion like birds of prey; and in this they were akin to the race of pleasure‑seekers, in that they direct all their thoughts only to the next moment and live wholly in it. They therefore at all times showed themselves restless, frivolous and mobile even in their mien, in all their doings as inconstant as air and water; with great cowardice yet, according to the circumstances, madly daring, cringing before every superiority, cruel and vengeful toward the weak, treacherous besides, and hot‑tempered, quarrelsome, vain and boastful beyond measure; besides this inclined to idleness, gluttony and every kind of sensual indulgence. Much cleverness, spirit and ability, however, are ascribed to them; above all, however, directed toward, by cunning craftiness, outwitting and injuring all those who are not of their blood, and whom they pursue with inherited hatred to deadly effect. Musical talent in particular is not uncommon among them; a certain skill too in the few trades they practise, for example iron‑smithing; but even greater deceitfulness in wheeling and dealing in horses and in every form of theft.

Thus these tribes, who on their arrival called themselves by an equally Egyptian word, Roma --- in their tongue "house‑fathers" --- were distinguished from all other peoples by the peculiar, fixed and gleaming light of their eyes; and so they have remained unchanged to this hour during the four centuries since their immigration. Their ephemeral existence, decided in the bare instant and drifting along carelessly with it, never allowed a serious religious idea to arise in them; without faith, without rites and without tradition they everywhere conformed to the religion of the country in which they lived, without further incurring the trouble of observing its practices. The same is true of their conjuring art. When, on their arrival, they wandered through Europe and were still received hospitably --- in and about the barns and sheds, in the neighbourhood of combustible materials they frequently kindled fires, and nothing burned there but the material placed into it --- they ascribed this to the peculiar natural power of the "fire‑root," which grows in Little Egypt on a high mountain, and of which they yearly obtained a large quantity from there. That was one of the elements of this art which they had brought from the Orient; others they picked up on the roads along which they travelled; and just as their language in this way adopted many foreign roots, so these magical roots were gathered into the stock of their knowledge and skill.

When, on these flights and journeys of theirs, the lodestone (magnet ironstone) came before them, their childish imagination saw in it a symbol of their thievish instinct, of sexual attraction, and of the faculty for smelling out hidden treasures; and it so took possession of them that they ascribed to it --- which they call Bar‑Lachi --- all miraculous powers, and believed of one who possessed such a talisman that he had nothing to fear from steel and lead, water and fire; that death had no power over him, that it made him invisible to his pursuers, and that it was excellently suited for love‑potions. They likewise ascribed very similar properties to the Gospels, when Berrow spread a translation of them into their language among them, which they at once carried with them on their thieving expeditions as a protecting charm. "All that our people truly believe they have learned from you," an old gypsy said to Grellmann; and indeed the charms they have to staunch blood, and those which they use every morning to make themselves secure, are not in their own tongue but in the German language. In like manner the acquaintance with the evil eye came to them on the road, in which they place great trust. That misfortune dwells in a house where an unbaptized child is found, but that good fortune attaches to every day that begins with passing through the parish church --- such opinions already prove by their very content a Christian origin. \[Page 55\]

Only their palm-reading from the hand, which is bound up with the piercing eye of their women, but otherwise rests on no deeper foundation in their nature, seems to be their own work. La Baht is the name of this art, which has made them famous throughout the world, and which, in the hands of girls, reads the future lover, in those of women the children, and in those of the older the impending rich inheritances. Hokkano Baro, however, the great Psiff, is said by the power of the spell to compel the earth-spirits to give up long-buried treasures; that magnet, fashioned against a piece of steel forged from the hook of the high court (the gallows), likewise cooperates; and thus this Cuenta or art appears so refined that, in the words of one of the initiated, even the Beugui Lango, the lame devil or Asmodeus, would not know what to add.

From what has been set forth here one can easily judge what is to be thought of the view of those who hold the whole witchcraft business to be a work of the fraudulent Cuenta of this people. If one of the initiated of the covenant leads the neophyte into the dark wood under the oak, and brings her a handsome demon; but he refuses the ugly woman because the procuress has pledged to bring him a young and beautiful one; if other accounts speak of riders who, clad in black and on black steeds, meet the women, beg for their favor, and, after they have willingly renounced all the saints, then pay them with a coin that afterward turns into shards;---if we read such things frequently in the protocols, then all this certainly sounds very human, in its generic character, but in manner gypsy-like. \[Page 56\]

The people's propensity for cunning fraud, which manifests itself especially in the arts of horse-cheating; their inclination to lust --- these things show through everywhere in such occurrences. Indeed nothing can resemble the Sabbath more than the spectacle presented by a horde of gypsies when they encamp by night in the forest gloom around their fires, and, the flames contending with the torn tree-shadows, they cast a singular illumination over the scene; when men and women there spread out their plunder, dance their dances, and gorge themselves on the fallen cattle, while their chiefs maintain a sort of etiquette. The effect must have been particularly significant in earlier times, when the nature of the people was still unknown, and rural women of the neighborhood were brought into this circle and, by prestidigitation they had seen on their travels, were made serviceable to the purposes of the craft. It cannot be denied that such things may often have happened; but to suppose that in the countless cases where witchcraft showed itself there were always gypsies present to set the machinery in motion would be a foolish assumption, and would never accord with the unstable, fugitive spirit of this people. Among the manifold causes that produced this historical phenomenon, this cause has therefore probably also occasionally played a part; by no means, however, in any way, not even remotely, an exclusive effect.

Very unlike the Jews, their traveling companions over the earth, the gypsies' unsettled mind never seriously delved into the abysses of the magical arts; only what was serviceable to them on their travels have they known how cleverly to grasp and, according to their purposes, to make use of. The outward trappings of the whole discipline, its showman-like aspect, they accordingly appropriated; and whereas what the Jews contributed toward the whole direction was mostly calculated for the higher ranks, they on their part played to the lower orders, the rural folk in particular.

The outward appearances of the Sabbath may therefore well have been taken from them: the light-effects of their encampments in forest solitude; the unboundness and the glaring contrasts that arise between wild nature and acquaintance with the polishes of modern life; the licentiousness that their way of life brings with it: all of this may so often have impressed itself on the actuality of the imagination that it at last recurred again in the visions of the Sabbath. The suspicion of child‑stealing soon arose against them, to which another, also cannibalistic appetite was soon added; no wonder, then, that this suspicion fastened also on the uncleanliness of their kitchens, and that the eating of children on the Sabbath now ran rife. They dance the same lascivious dance in which the Egyptian women likewise excel, and which, according to Swinburne, is called Maquendoy in Spain; it is, as we are taught by explicit testimony, a prototype of the Sabbath dances.

Amulets and magical roots, too, have already played their part in the whole mischief. Their women cook love‑potions from the root of the good baron (la raiz del buen Baron); their men have thrown the Drau, a powder or the like, into the herds so that the cattle fall ill, and afterwards, when called, they may heal them again, or so that the fallen beasts may become their prey. k) When their women make people ill with the evil eye (querelar nasula); when the Moors in Africa, from the Dar‑Buschi‑Fal belief, think they know how to transform a white man into a negro; when they themselves generally boast of the art of witchcraft --- it remains uncertain whether, in these matters, they comported themselves as teachers or as apprentices; probably they were both within their circle, and thus contributed their share to the further spread of this practice.

### Chapter 2. Natural Disposition for Witchcraft and Sorcery

\[Page 57\]

The human being is born into history; each individual contributes to shaping it in their own part, but is, in turn, shaped by it. Witchcraft is thus also a historical product, and we have, in the preceding, considered and explained the historical influences that contributed to its emergence. But the indirect historical influence presupposes a direct effect; nothing can exist in history that was not previously or simultaneously present in the individuals, who only receive from it what they have previously invested in it. The second moment, on which all sorcery is based, is thus this autonomous quality, which conditions all historical phenomena through the individual. The self of the personality is twofold, composed of body and soul. The consideration of this moment will have two aspects: insofar as it takes its starting point from the physical and its inherent bound life, and then is directed to transition to the free-spirited. The present section shall therefore serve the investigation of the physical disposition and the temporal and spatial conditions associated with it; the following section, however, shall take as its task the consideration of the spiritual and what is connected with it.

#### A. The Obsession with Magic and Sorcery

When the exodus into history first began, the earth, with all its earthly directions and tendencies, was assigned as stage and racecourse to those who were journeying forth; but the demonic world had its provident care concealed at the very moment when the higher world of spirits withdrew from the fallen: both were to draw near to the wanderers in their continued influence only under the covering of earthly conditions and of powers limited by the earthly; and help or temptation, so that the scales should not be too unequal, were to come to them only in the binding and guise of the earthly medium. \[Page 58\]

This is the ordinary course of the world; the abysses over which man walks are closed and sealed in the bosom of the deep; upward the bound gaze may well reach into the spaces of the stars, but not beyond these into the spirit-depths. Thus, being dependent on that which is like himself, he must above all see to it that he does not fall through his own fault; the assaults from below will then be powerless against the upright man, because the higher protection binds them back from him. But if we see that individuals or whole masses turn aside from the path and knock at the closed gate in order to seek help from the monstrous shadows of the abyss, then something in them must have become disturbed and displaced from the ordinary order of things; a darkly falling shade must have dimmed and clouded the cheerfulness of life in them; so that between the darknesses of those nocturnal realms and their own inner ones a certain sympathy exists, and in it powers awaken which stand in a certain rapport with those of the abyss. If this overshadowing first occurs in the bodily, it will, having become habitual, form a morbid disposition that turns away from the ordinary toward the unusual; an idiosyncrasy that takes pleasure in bitterness, a delight in what is not pleasurable, and ultimately even a liking for evil. This disposition, however, will take root as a disease in life and in its organs; and preferably in the central organ of that life, in the ganglionic system, and in it slowly develop into a craving of its own.

When, in the first of these mystical books, we spoke of the organic inner structure of the body and of the currents that connect all these subdivisions among themselves, we also treated of the articulation of this ganglionic system, and it there divided itself for us into a threefold group of organs. The first, its head part, is connected to the distributions of the sympathetic system which, issuing from its upper cervical nodes, run along the carotids and vertebrals, join with them in the vascular circle, and from there, as the peculiar center of a distinct and yet in the general circulation opening system, lay its vessels through the whole brain. Its second or trunk part is formed by the 24--30 ganglia connected by their commissures, which run down along the vertebral column as a second sympathetic spinal cord, and with their nerve outgoings supply the vessels of the whole torso. Its third division finally presses together into the visceral part, the brain of the lower belly, and the so‑called semilunar ganglia gather together. Around it are arranged: stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, testicles and the intestinal canal downward; lungs and thymus with the pharynx and windpipe. Through the diaphragm this lower brain sends its capillary vessels to all the organs, and with a peripheral, branched ganglion it serves the fecal excretions; while the two encircling \[ganglia\] supply the respective accompanying secretory parts.

As these viscera are therefore divided into twelve organs, so the corresponding brain will likewise divide into twelve ganglia which, connected among themselves by commissures, form a cooperating mass; so much so that each for itself, and yet all together, supplies each of the named organs with its nerve outflow. The highest organization of the system in the head is thus formed circularly and crown‑like in its central ground; the lowest in the depths of the viscera, from the plurality of separate centers, plastically united into a compact central mass; while the connecting middle one, the subordinate central ganglia from above downward, binds them together into a descending line and into a strand. Now in life there is nowhere dead rest and rigid torpor; everywhere there is current and motion: and everywhere an overwhelming flow must, in a compelling way, hold the individual within its bounds. Accordingly, in the whole system such a flowing current will circulate without interruption; and this will appear divided according to a threefold modality. In the head the current will, in its innermost ground, close upon itself in a circle; as most currents in the brain-system indeed proceed in a ring. The current within the viscera will, to and from a contracted centre, take place massively along three mutually perpendicular axes. The third, finally, will run straight down along the spinal column, descending from the first to the second and from the second again rising to the first; thus alternately lowering and raising itself, sinking the upper into the lower, and, in turn, raising the lower toward the upper. All three then unite in one and the same great current, which corresponds to the circulation of the blood down in the depths.

Each ganglion in this great circle then completes its subordinate circle, in which it, from its centre, governs its peripheral expansion through its nerves. All such subordinate vortices of separate activities that thus form are again encompassed by the three larger vortices --- the wreath-like, the plastically operative one about the formative axes, and the penetrating, up-and-down oscillating one --- and in health all are kept enclosed within their boundaries; the equalization of the threefoldly different movements of life itself, however, is entrusted to the implanted conservative power of life itself. Just as the heart is charged with the regulation of the entire circular movement of the blood, so the heart-ganglion also seems placed as guardian over the equilibration of these different movements.

This ganglion is therefore placed in the very midst of them all, where they appear drawn closest together at their innermost starting-points; near at half the distance of the vascular wreath from the celiac ganglion, and three nervous radiations bind it to both and at the same time to the third intermediate member which links them. The whole system is again submitted to the higher systems, and if affected in its members these will in turn draw those affections into their own, and its currents will play over into theirs. Thus there will be an intercourse between the visceral ganglia and that part of the spinal cord and brain which serves life; another between the middle sympathetic system and that which, of the two, operates in voluntary movement; and the third system, finally, with the head insofar as it performs intellectual functions.

From such diversely held streams, poured forth through the manifold articulations of the life-system, the great movement of life is assembled; and everything that happens and occurs within its circle appears in its origin to be determined thereby. The alternation between sleep and waking appears especially brought about by the perpendicular ascending-and-descending; and when, in the first state, the lowest circling has become dominant --- when life has entwined everything into its natural unity --- then this closedness becomes a point of passage into another state. When we spoke of somnambulism, we distinguished two kinds of waking of the system: in one it reaches over into the external physical world and perceives and acts and performs its functions; while in the other it opens itself to the world of spirits. \[Page 59\]

From the first waking-world into the second, and from this back into the former, the transition, however, passes through the state of sleep; and we have furthermore explained how the gradual inward awakening of the system --- advancing by the threefold order of sympathetic movement --- marks the steps and degrees of magnetic elevation up to clairvoyance. But the matter can also be considered from another point of view. Although the whole movement of life appears of earthly character, the part of this movement in the circumference of the skull nevertheless expresses the solar element in it; the other, in the region of the lower entrails, the lunar; and only in the middle sphere does the properly kernel-like earthly show itself distinctly. If now the slight overturning of the life-movement in general --- from outward waking into the inner, in general toward the side of nature --- constitutes the predisposition to magnetically somnambulistic states, then this lightness, when especially attached to the upper mode of motion in the head, will establish a predisposition to a sunlike life-magnetism; whereas, when lying upon the lower mode in the entrails, it will evoke a moonlike magnetic disposition.

The Sun is the lamp of day, radiating light and warmth, the two greatest goods of nature; the prophets of the old service of nature, whose inner being had opened itself to the power of the luminary, recognized themselves as children of Helios, descendants of the radiant Apollo; and, mindful of their inspiration by him, they described the path that his prophetic ray takes from the pit of the heart to the oracle-speaking mouth. The Moon, however, is the lamp of night; what she conceals in her womb she partly unveils with her borrowed light; coolness and moisture are the media in which her effect most gladly reveals itself. Those, then, in whom the lowest vital movement has the impulse to sink into the nocturnal seclusion of this luminary, called themselves children of the Moon, proclaiming prophecy under its influences. The mild Sun, however, becomes an angry one when, by excess, she makes her gifts destructive; and the beneficent Artemis becomes grim when her blessings are in the same way transformed into poisons. The Helios-seers of the first order are thus likewise changed, and the benefactors become corrupters; while those inspired by Artemis, now thrown into frenzy by the Angry One, go about as the helpers of Hecate in nocturnal gloom.

As the mild Sun, now bountiful in giving, is, in her anger, kindling, enflaming and consuming --- her nature therefore pointing to the masculine, as in the choleric temperament --- the Moon, on the other hand, in her good mood is receiving, fostering, preserving, and in gentle light begetting; but in her dark aspect she unleashes every nocturnal horror, stiffening and binding all life. In this effect of hers she thus behaves as feminine, as in the melancholic temperament alternatingly; so will it also be with the double chorus of those inspired by them. The sun-mania, in which the Helios-servants shine forth radiantly and again burn scorching in grim fire, will predominantly be the affair of the male sex, and have the choleric temperament as its organic basis. The moon-mania, which, like the Moon in her phases, alternates between light and shadow and thus between sorrow and joy, will be found chiefly in the female sex and will attach itself to the alternation of the melancholic temperament. \[Page 60\]

What here in the circle of nature acts as a closed system is introduced into the cacodæmonic or agathodæmonic circles; when, as there, the system, instead of manifesting in outwardness, awakens into the inwardness of physical nature, it opens into the inwardness of the spirit-world; and now, in place of the forces of nature, evil or good spirits set themselves into rapport with it. The transition, initiated by various intermediate stages, already appears clearly in magnetic somnambulism; when the lower life, ceasing to play with the forces of nature, is lost in the deeper circles of the spirit-kingdom that are akin to it; and now the double nature of all human drives, divided into good and evil, successively or simultaneously---attracting the homogeneous in these circles and repelling the heterogeneous---falls into states which outwardly bear all the signs of a higher ecstasy and then also those of an incipient possession. The same was already the case in ancient times with their nature-enthusiasts; and while, in the better mysteries that guided and initiated them, a higher, ennobling ray shone in, the worse ones in their abominations assumed altogether a demonic character. The demonic, then, breaking into these natural states, finds in them a predisposition that favors such an intrusion; just as the better, when promoted by them, finds its access facilitated.

Now sun and moon, and thus likewise sun-sickness and moon-sickness, do not, in life, behave at all exclusively as salutary and harmful in the physical, and still less as good and evil in the ethical; yet they do present themselves to the intruding intelligences in different ways. The moonlike, in space bound twice---by the earth and by the sun---has therefore the condition of being bound as one of its essential characteristics, and can accordingly be more readily mastered by the objectively evil as well as by the good. The sunlike in the regions, however, being predominantly binding and only subordinately bound, adapts itself less readily to being bound---just as in double stars it only, as an exception, associates with a similar body; whereas the planetary cannot exist without such an ordering. Moon-sickness is thus more easily mastered because it is already in itself divided into phases of light and darkness, and so more readily divides itself into those of good and evil and, at last, becomes aligned with one or the other; whereas sun-sickness, not so easily dissolved, offers greater resistance to the power of the objective.

The lower visceral life, to which the one (i.e. moon-sickness) is tied, is thereby---like the lower, night-covered nature---by it brought nearer to the spiritual under-realm; while the system to which the other (i.e. sun-sickness) adheres, being more remote from these regions, approaches the higher physical; so that even the spiritual can, at least with less strong separation, more readily break through. For the same reason that in the physical domain lunar floods and ebbs are greater than the analogous solar movements of the element, there were in ancient times more enthusiastic moon-women than sun-seers; more Thessalian enchantresses than male sorcerers; and in later times more female seers than male---and therefore also more witches and sorceresses than sorcerers. The reason lies, plainly expressed, in the natural relations of the sexes, in the melancholic and choleric temperaments in which their difference stands out most sharply; and thus it comes about that this difference of physical constitution, according to sexual difference, has likewise been impressed upon the realm of witchcraft: the witch-nature being especially attached to moon-sickness, where possession found a fertile soil; while the natural substratum of the male magical nature preferred to take root in a sun-sick disposition. Notwithstanding the full moral freedom of the sexes --- to which therefore also the entirely equal accountability attaches --- nature nevertheless disposes, once choice has been made, the execution more toward the form of one or the other side, and the modality is then again conditioned by the course taken.

#### B. Sidereal Influences on the Natural Constitution and Epidemic Outbreaks

\[Page 61\]

In the nature-belief of antiquity it was especially the sun and the moon that stirred the drives in the realm of instincts tending inward and upward; they were the queen about whom the swarming flights of bees assembled. The sun, the great light of day, was also, in the outward vivification, the root of the works which, with prudence, are accomplished by day; just as the small light of night exerted its influence upon the plastic works of the nocturnal world. Clearly delineated natural beings, and acting as such in these reflective states, they were, on the other hand, mystical powers in the unconscious, naturally ecstatic states, awakening and stimulating those states by their effect; and since above all women most frequently and most easily fell into these states, it was, beside Apollo Helios, especially Luna --- the one most closely turned toward them --- who exercised this mystical power above all, and gathered them about her in the stirrings and movements which she produced in them. She was indeed the Lilith of the Hebrews, the lady of darkness; the Artemis of the deeper Orient, the Alilat of the Arabs and the Melitta of the Assyrians; the two-horned Psḫat or Bubastis of the Egyptians; Diana, formerly Jana, the mother of hidden life, and as Trivia the goddess of the ways who leads her retinue over forests and mountains, thus the Norse Holda riding over the heights; the Lydian girls danced and rode for her on Tmolus, and the Spartan maidens performed the Carga before her. She was, over the whole earth, the mistress of female life; she ruled all the waters of life that flood within it; and in her was represented the great heart of nature, through which she pulsed all things, and from which she then first poured herself into the individual human heart, and thereby ever kept it in general union with the centre of nature. Beside her was then that Helios, the source of all the higher nerve-spirits, so to speak the sensorium and common nervous centre of the all; leaning more toward men, among whom especially the kings were regarded as sun-born. They were mystically illumined from above, so that they might again radiate what they had received, as human Heliads, upon their subjects, and in higher states move the nervous systems just as that All-Mother moved the vascular tissue, in manifold stirrings.

In that nature-belief, however, the contradiction of good and evil also referred back to the hidden grounds of the all, and communicated itself to all beings that arose from its depths. Both were branches of the same life inherent in the unity of nature, which in them was only split in different directions, and could, possibly, also restore itself again out of them. Thus wrath lay alongside mildness, dread was joined with friendliness, life with death, suspicion easily allied itself with goodness, and cheerfulness was united with horror. The same Helios who awakens the whole earth to activity with his rain of light also sends forth the poisoned arrows of pestilences. The goddess of the night, the leader of her retinue over the heights of heaven and through the depths of the earth --- as the moon is always divided between light and shadow, so she separates herself into the mildly shining Berecynthia, who traverses the Maenalon, and the dreadful Hecate of the dark nether realm, attired with all its terrors; as also Ceres, giver of the harvest, the earth-mother opened to the light, who bore the subterranean daughter and queen of the shadow-realm, Persephone. \[Page 62\]

This division continued also among the daughters of the earth, magnetically linked with them in choirs; and just as day and night, summer and winter, sowing and harvest ever alternate upon this many‑cleft earth, so too is the life of the earthly drawn into these alternations; and to the ritual choirs of the Destroyer there always succeed those of the Builder, and the round dance thus ever passes its turn down into the depth, and rises again to the height. The mysteries which the sex therefore celebrated for life and the fruitful nature‑deities were thus split about midnight, according to day‑night and night‑day; for that which is to germinate must first perish and be buried that it may attain to resurrection. The secrets of destruction in all generation, spiritual as well as physical, therefore formed the subject of one half‑chorus; generation amid all destruction the subject of the other, and both made themselves known in everything in which, in the realm of appearance, the two directions were revealed.

Thus the women's choirs which, in the Romance South even in the first Christian times, were gathered about the Night‑Queen, their mistress, plainly reflect the nature of their leader. They held, under her presidency, these their assemblies in nocturnal leisure, to consult about the fates of the night‑realms; the mistress's ministerials were chosen there, offences were punished, and fostering deeds were richly rewarded there; at the banquet the mistress then shone mild and gracious through the nightly coolness. When the following, led by her, set out at the turn of the year in the great procession through the dwellings of men, then it was the play of Diana and of the good mothers that took place; it is the good and wise women who move in it; indeed they are also called the good things. Men open to them kitchen and cellar, and they taste of the offerings thus presented without diminishing them; and in return give yearly fertility and blessing and prosperity. For Abundantia or Satia is the name of their mistress, and where she goes the fullness of good things springs up at her footsteps. But if she turns to the other side, she becomes the Wrathful, the Fury‑burned, the Perfidious and the Harm‑doing: then her retinue likewise turns; the dark nocturnal side appears, the earth is smitten with barrenness, the house with misfortune, the children wither and life fades.

At the moon‑table, which stands beside the sun‑table of the ancient Ethiopians, the gentle goddess had given drink and food to the needy; now the hating one pours forth the poison of Colchian‑Thessalian witchcraft. Now the monsters of the old night spread their dark brew over the timorous. Even beauty is transformed into a ravening beast. Lamia, the daughter of the ancient Bel and of Libya, in the land of terror Africa, wins the favour of the Olympian, and he brings her to Italy, where the city named after her is built. Juno kills, in jealous anger, all her offspring, and she in envy and rage again slays all the births of other women. Now the Lamiae, the dread of children, go forth; they who may transform themselves into any thing --- into birds, dogs, mice, even flies --- inclined alike to sensual pleasure and to cruelty, and kindling beforehand into heat those who would consume them. The daughter of that first Lamia, however, was the African clairvoyant Sibyl, the old Saga, from sagire, to see sharply; the ancestress of all those who, probing the mysteries of the nether realm, bring them to light; while the striges of the Latins circle about the cradles, and suck the blood of sleepers, and rend their entrails. \[Page 63\]

To these terrors, which have been raised up from the south, others move against them whose origin is in the north. In the realm of Holda the same division holds, as we have already seen; if she is kindly disposed, then her host likewise brightens. They help the Mistress spin the threads out of which, over meadow and field, vegetation weaves itself; they help her preserve the children in the deep well and bring them forth into the daylight; they fill the jugs with mead and wine. But if the purpose of the goddess is perverted into malignity, then the fair ones about her are likewise transformed into monsters; the thread on the distaff becomes confused and tangled, the fruit is smitten with drought and blight; storms rage through the once-still air; the midwives become child‑stealers and practice child‑devouring; hunger and want take the place of riches.

Now Christianity came into the world and put into general force a previously prepared doctrine. The idea of the Godhead was held to be the absolutely Good, altogether incompatible with any kind of Evil and incapable of being stained by any touch. In connection with sin, however, the origins of this Evil were laid in the will of the rational creature; which will, according as it kept itself freely in the likeness of God or in apostasy received the evil into itself, was divided in two directions --- taking between them the irrational, and therefore also in its irresponsibility only by communication capable of evil but not of sinning, the physical nature, --- and assigning to it above and below the mixed human nature capable both of apostasy and of union. Before this doctrine the powers that had earlier assumed the masks of natural forms, as the Egyptian gods assumed animal shapes, were compelled to unmask. If they had previously passed themselves off as gods whose essence manifested itself in them in good and evil, they must now appear as demonic powers that, by fraudulent usurpation of the essence of the Godhead, had practised robbery against God. With them fell now all their worshipers and confessors whom they had found among men, and in whose associations their falsely divine natures had incarnated themselves in good and evil, down to the same level of reprobation; it was the Evil, therefore, which had thus taken shape in grievous deceit, in the uprising of the creature against its Creator; and therefore it had to fall into dissolution to make room for a better formation.

##### Christianity Against Nature Beliefs

\[Page 64\]

A strikingly significant hint of how this relationship was thought of from the beginning of the modern period into the later Middle Ages is found in the life of St. Taurinus, the bishop of Corbeil, in the earliest period of Christianity there. He bound in the year of Diana the demon who there played the Night‑Goddess. The spirit, because he rendered willing obedience to the saint, is not sent to Hell: rather his punishment is allotted to him in the very region where he had previously ruled. Henceforth he must appear in manifold forms without doing harm to anyone; by the people about there called Gobelin from that time until now (the Life was written in the middle of the twelfth century). The folk had had manifold experiences of the doings of the so‑called kobolds; the ambiguous, good‑naturedly malicious mixed nature, the helpfulness of these beings combined with teasing wilfulness and evil craft in these ghostlike natures, had awakened their reflection; and the question about their origin and their relations had been repeatedly raised. The introduction of Christianity at last set this inquiry on a track: the holy man had driven away the old mistress of the night, and she had yielded to his exorcism without resistance. The natural power, referred back to the spirit dwelling in it, now becomes a ghostly apparition which, where it formerly exercised dominion, has now sunk to servitude; and for a small dwarf's wage helps to carry on the household affairs.

Now the canon attributed to the Synod of Ancyra also speaks of the criminal women who, having turned back to Satan and, through the deceits of the demons, been led into delusion, rode in troops on beasts, in the retinue of the heathen Diana, through the stillness of the night, across wide distances, on certain nights called to the service of the mistress. For there are now demons transformed into women who formerly rode with the once well-named mistress, but who now take the likenesses (larvae) of neighboring women who meanwhile sleep in their beds, as St. Germanus made proof. The company of night-women is now, even where it brings good, a confederacy of witch-women, which, abusing good for evil ends, robs the Creator of his honor and turns it over to the fallen spirits. Holda, in whose service they rode northward, has become a she-fiend; a name with which the language likewise names the Devil. Her company have shared in the same transformation; the white Alrune has become a treacherous enchantress, the old Asine a Here. They now go through the houses, light funeral candles, and know only how to steal children who, at their banquets, at the command of the mistress, are either torn apart and eaten, or---out of a sudden fit of pity---are carried back to the cradle; they torment the sleepers in every way and practise every sort of evil. \[Page 65\]

Through the Greek lands the Gellones now pass, they who enter through closed doors and suddenly destroy the children;---as such a one, in Byzantium, according to the account of his mother, often carried the newborn Emperor Maurice out of the room, but was unable to harm him. In Italy the old Matres and Matronae have become Mascae; the old fairies or fates, for whom the Neapolitan women set out the tables so that they kept the children and kept the house pure, are deceiving phantoms; and these gather in bands around the dethroned mistress, called Queen Mab in Ireland, in Brescia also la Donna del Ginco, in the so‑called Tregendas, to the lordly place. For, says Bartholomew de Spina, from the confessions of those who ride we know officially that they, before anointing themselves at night, first wait for the noise of the mistress as she passes with the great throng of those rejoicing; only then do they anoint themselves in order to join the throng, until they all arrive at the appointed place. This place is above all for Italy the walnut‑tree of Benevento, there where the old Lombard tree with the golden dragon stood; in France la croce d'el Pastiecio, in other countries other \[places\]: everywhere, however, they are those spots where the old pagan mysteries of the gods were celebrated at the feet of their images and in the surrounding groves.

The Herodias who takes the place of Diana, and who under the name Radodese long was the terror of children in the Venetian region, and who in Ferrara also bears the name of the Sibyl, thence conducts her following beyond the sea to the Jordan. This happens twice in every week, and all their striving is directed to the single aim that they might but once touch the waters of the stream; to her, who already is mistress of one third of the earth's circle, it would---if she succeeded in that---fall to possess the whole world. But the river draws back before her, and would sooner dry up than permit the touch. All this is perfectly fabulous, and only wishes to assert: that if the unholy could force itself upon the holy by violence, nothing thereafter would be able to resist its power. But that can never succeed, and so the mistress each time abandons the useless, yet ever-repeated task; and all the more becomes enraged, so that everyone must flee from her wrath.

Thus, at the turning-point of history the whole doctrine was reversed; humanity was to be torn from the bonds of nature, and to enter a higher, serene kingdom of God. But these bonds held fast; for in that part of it which belonged to the earth the higher, guiding consciousness had grown dim, taken root, and had grown up with it. With all instincts and dark drives the ancient belief in Nature was confirmed; the sun acted in it, the moisture of the earth greened in it. When the seed sprang up in the fields, and the groves about the temples put forth leaves, then the enthusiasm for Nature rose also inwardly; and the night-veiled realm within man germinated, greened, blossomed with the kingdoms of nature. \[Page 66\]

Most closely bound in this union with Nature was the tilling population; and in their midst, again most strongly, the sex of women, in whom the root of human growth sinks into the earth. One knows with what tenacious attachment the old rural folk clung to their belief in Nature; so that, in opposition to the new doctrine, it was branded with the name of paganism. Even in Italy, the centre of Christianity, it was able only slowly and gradually to take root again in that portion of the population. In the fourth century the more mobile cities had for the most part turned away from it; the countryside, however, especially in the mountains, had remained entirely heathen; and Bishops Gaudentius of Brescia and St. Massinus of Turin therefore bitterly reproach the possessors that they allowed their castalds to persist in the old heathenism. At Monte Cassino Benedict still found an Apollo temple where the people offered sacrifices in the very solitude of the forest. That old Lombard tree near Benevento stood down to the end of the seventh century, an object of veneration, untouched; until at length the holy Barbatus, bishop of the place, one day took an axe and hurried out with an escort to the sacrilege that called itself arbor sanctiva, and having felled it at the root he heaped earth about it, so that no one might find even a trace of it.

By no means, however, was the matter thereby settled in those relatively early centuries. Even at the end of the fifteenth \[century\] the inhabitants of Arezzo still highly honoured a spring over which, from the times of paganism, an altar had been erected in the darkness of the wood; whither the people, according to old custom, went on pilgrimage as to an oracle of Apollo, to obtain answers to secret questions or healing of the ills that afflicted them. Here, too, it was the holy Bernardino who finally destroyed the ancient belief in Nature. One day he preached on the subject, then exhorted his hearers to accompany him in the work of destruction; and at once, provided with axes and other tools and accompanied by the people, he went to the spring, stopped its flowing source with stones, and overturned the altar, so that thenceforth the memory of the thing perished.

How much the councils and synods in France, Spain, and Germany had to contend with similar matters is known from their acts and decrees. Especially in the latter country it was again the mountain people, and the tilling tribes of the Saxon lowlands, who most stubbornly held to the old ways; and this returned with force as soon as even a cloud of heresy passed over the sunlit mirror of the new doctrine.

Thus in Frisia, in the time of Emperor Lothar, the teaching of Arins and Sabellius had spread; immediately the old natural faith of the Æsir-doctrine reappeared. The country became full of cries: on that hill the old elves' dwelling had opened; they, whom one also used to call witte wywen, the wise women, in the vernacular. Their house was an underground cave; from it one heard first a dull murmur, then an immense lamenting and weeping of people; then again children's cries, and alternately music and notes of joy. Night-wanderers and cattle-herds were carried off, mothers with their infants were seized; and therefore the women in childbirth and their children were kept under strict guard, lest they should thus fall into the hands of the elves. Saint Odulphus had to instruct the people against these deceptions; and they vanished only when the people had been newly confirmed in the faith. \[Page 67\]

From then on we see, at every any significant change of religion in the countries, similar appearances break out, as it were epidemically. Thus everywhere the old inclinations had remained behind, but their objects had been taken away; a great upheaval had cast down into the abyss those things which had formerly been objects of the people's veneration; no wonder that it was difficult and slow to accommodate itself to the change. Indeed other affections presented themselves, in part at the same localities; but even where people gradually resolved to accept them, the old recollection still long continued to work; and the new comers still had to contend late with the remnants of earlier habit, and to share the worship with the expelled. But when, in the course of time, they gradually carried off the victory, and the godless worship of the powers of nature was really regarded as robbery against God and as demonic worship, the dim transitional period, which had lasted many centuries, had prepared the way: that which otherwise in itself contradicts human nature was led over to the veneration and service of the evil principle as such; and when Manichaeism set itself up as the representative of this principle, it everywhere found in men's minds a basis to which its otherwise paradoxical teaching could attach itself. \[Page 68\]

The memories and echoes of the old paganism thus cooperated with the errors of later times; the darknesses of the ages that had sunk backward into a glooming past; the darkness of nights, of forests; the spiritual obscurities and the moral cloudings: they all flowed together into one abyss. In its midst the idea of a Satan's realm on earth now developed, which was to have its right, its law and constitution, form and aspect alongside the kingdom of God; in it the old, inexpiable claims of matter against ensoulment, of the flesh against the spirit, were to be represented; and the old, irreconcilable struggle of both powers was to be continued until the end. Into this strife there entered, however, the material counterpart, with the whole real weight of its palpable corporeality. What human nature enclosed in itself of such dark, bodily forces and appetites, in opposition to the rule which the spirit at all times --- and in the new doctrine more than ever --- had assumed, found itself disposed to take part where, as it seemed, the contest was for its emancipation. This had to happen most decisively again among the lower classes of the people, where all these vigorous, fleshly instincts had been preserved most solidly; and where the higher light, on the whole, had still made itself a way most sparingly.

In this domain, then, it will again be chiefly the farmers, shepherds, and seafarers --- those who in their daily intercourse with physical nature also strengthen and exercise most the forces most closely akin to it --- who will be preferentially inclined to that side. Again those whose seats lie in the high and middle mountains, those whose dwellings are in marshes and swamps, remote from the great currents of intellectual intercourse; those who, settled in the spirit of the seashore, by the barrenness of the land were driven over to the moving wave; --- once they had been won to that cause, these would again be its most natural and stalwart allies in the service of the Nether-Realm. Finally, men and women again, according to their different temperaments, will be disposed to that side: women, by virtue of their constitution more closely related to Nature, and the closer union in which their powers stand; by the greater mobility of their whole being for external impressions; by the changeable inconstancy of their will comparable to the element of water; by the forward play of the powers of imagination, and by a tougher, more enduring passion --- will incline most to this side. Thus even way of life, locality, and sex must operate together with historical memories to realize the idea of Evil as such in a large fellowship on earth, and to make it the guiding principle within them.

#### C. The Endemic Influence According to Earthly Localities

From what has been said it now becomes intelligible why witchcraft and sorcery, in their whole diffusion, are bound, just as they prefer certain times, likewise to particular localities. That they belong, according to time, to the periods of transition --- both of the natural faith and of the spiritual --- and in the latter from one form to another, has been made clear above. That spatially they attach with equal preference to those conditions where the natural still manifests the most persistence and most powerfully plays over into the higher life, will likewise be evident, even on only a superficial survey of the existing relations. History shows that in all places and in every situation where the old paganism was longest preserved; where, for the same reason, perhaps later the Manichaean heresy struck its deepest roots; --- there subsequently the greatest development of witchcraft and sorcery was attained. \[Page 69\]

The great mountain-parallel that runs from east to west through the old world will indicate to us the line of its progress. In the west, therefore, France and Italy will especially attract our attention. As to France, Alphonsus Spina already names in his Fortalitium, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, Gascony and the Dauphiné, "ubi nimium abundant tales perversae mulieres"; and Alphonsus Tostado about the same time adds the neighboring Spain: thus, from the Dauphiné through the whole of the Basque country, even into the Spanish mountains, witchcraft has spread to a great extent. It is therefore the inhabitants of the Pyrenees and the Alps who have done most in this direction; to which Lorraine must also be added, where Rémy found great material. The Basques, however, are already known as the most tenacious adherents of custom, habitual way of life, homeliness, old manners and former conviction; and in this sense they are the only ones among the present Southern Europeans --- although a small people --- who have preserved their old language unchanged; and their most ancient forefathers would be able to make themselves understood with them in it, and to find their way among their customs. \[Page 70\]

From the midst of that people of French allegiance, from the little district of Labourt, the charge of a generally spread witchcraft and sorcery was now in many ways brought against Henry IV; and in the year 1609 he appointed a commission consisting of President Espagnet, Councillor of State, and the councillor at the Parliament of Bordeaux, De Lancre, to carry out the inquiry on the spot and to bring the guilty to trial; subject to any oppositions and appeals that might be lodged. They remained four months in the country, and soon convinced themselves that the accusation was not groundless. The great number of the proofs filled them with dread, and the strangest facts came to their knowledge. Their arrival, moreover, had produced a panic terror throughout the whole country. Everyone fled by water and by land; pilgrimages to Montserrat and to St. Jacob were used as a pretext; Upper and Lower Navarre and all the Spanish frontier provinces filled with fugitives; and the Spanish inquisitors stationed themselves on the border to turn the runaways back. The investigation proceeded in the meantime, and its results De Lancre summarized in a book which he gave the title: Tableau de l'inconstance des mauvais anges et démons, où il est amplement traité des Sorciers et de la Sorcellerie. Paris, 1613. In the first book, Discourses II and III, he speaks of the character and circumstances of the country and people in the following manner.

\"The land of Labourt is an office composed of twenty-seven parishes, with a population of about 30,000 souls, without trade or industry. The inhabitants live along the sea, stretching inward into the mountains; and speak, like their neighbours, the peculiar Basque tongue. The country is therefore at once a mountain-land and a frontier-land of three kingdoms: France, Spain, and Navarre; the meeting-place of three languages, and likewise belonging to two dioceses, and likewise divided between land and sea. The sea, however, makes them rustic, coarse and ill-mannered; the spirit as well as the prosperity of those who give themselves to it is tied to rigging and to movable pennons, and thus movable like the wind; millet, which the mountains produce for them, and fish, which the sea provides, compose their food; the sky meanwhile is their covering, and the sails are their tablecloth. They are so accustomed to see the inconstant element in tumult and storm that they fear and dread nothing so much as its calm and its stillness, entrusting all their welfare to its waves, which rock them up and down day and night. Hence it comes that the nature of the sea imparts itself to their manners, their intercourse, their speech, and even to their faith; which likewise does not leave them even when they again set foot on land. They are then always as if striking in waves---hasty, choleric; at the slightest whim that passes through their heads they throw themselves upon you and set a dagger to your throat.

The land, moreover, would not deny them its produce, were it not that they have turned their inclination preferentially to the ocean and to the sea, that lawless, untamed element, the navigation of which is a veritable and plain despair. Now consequently their soil has become meagre, barren and poor to them; and they themselves are also sluggish and idle when they have returned from their voyages; and their idleness leads them, before they have grown old, to a beggarly state which presses heavily upon them again; because, as immediate neighbours of the Spaniards, they feel an extraordinary amount of their pride and presumption within themselves. They have moreover not even a secure harbour in their country, and must, when they arrive from Terre-Neuve, Canada, or the two Indies, put in at St. Sebastian or Fontarabie; where they are under Spanish authority, which makes them yet more dependent.\" \[Page 71\]

These privations kill in them the love of their fatherland, and their long absences on their sea-voyages moreover stifle their love for wife and child, who have been left behind alone with the old people, and make them indifferent and cold. Even if their wives wish for their return, on account of the small earnings they have made; yet it is only the winter season that brings them home; in which, since they pursue no trade at all, they consume what has been earned in the inns, without giving any of it to their families; whereupon in the spring they sail out again as poor as they were before, and frequently --- meeting with misfortune --- do not return. They do not even properly know their wives at all, because they live with them only half the year; and as to their children, the custom they have of taking wives on trial for several years before they actually marry them is also detrimental to their relationship with those women.

As for the women, they in turn live in a like, or even more distressing, condition with regard to the men, whose company they enjoy only half the time, and whom, divided by expectation, doubt, and uncertainty, they regard only half as their husbands. They are no support to them or to their families, and treat them only temporarily as their wives; whereby many, upon the husbands' return, are forced to let it happen that the mothers choose another father for their children. Just as the Indians of Hispaniola inhale the vapor of a certain herb called cohoba, which confuses their minds; and when they have taken it, slipping their hands between their knees and hanging down their heads, remain for a time in ecstasy; whereupon, rising, they tell wondrous tales of their false gods, which they call Cemis --- just as our people do when they come from the Sabbath --- so do these women behave with petun or nicotiana, which each plants in her garden, however small it may be; and whose vapor they use to clear their brains and to somewhat stave off hunger.

Now I do not know whether this vapor stupefies them as that plant stupefies the Indians; but I do know that it makes their breath and whole body so foul-smelling that no creature not accustomed to it can endure the stench. They, however, practise this fumigation four times a day, and thus, accustomed to this smell and to the sea-smell of the men, they dread no other. Formerly, as girls enjoying the freedom of the mountains, already reminded by the manner of their head-dress of the nudities of paganism, they have, in the close relations of the sexes, too often listened to temptation for those other demons to frighten them. Neither they nor the men, moreover, have been raised in the fear of God. Even their priests have in part given themselves to the service of Satan, and have even profaned their churches. For we have judicially established that the Sabbath has been kept in the church of the Holy Spirit on Mount Rhune, and in the church of Dourdar. \[Page 72\]

Thus, instead of promoting the congregation and bringing it to a better path through churchly aid, they rather lead it astray; by repeating at night everything that they practise in the church by day in the service of evil. The women again take their part in this; for they have free access to the churches under the name of the Benedictines, who undertake the outward household, decorate the altar, keep the linen in order, and exercise similar duties. One such woman must already be in the church before daybreak, just as the last must be there in the evening to clear away the altars and extinguish the lights; which, in a land of such loose morals, can give occasion to many things that do not respect the sanctity of the place.

From all this is explained whence the great spread of witchcraft in this country comes. The men are light and agile, both in body and in mind; decisive and hasty in all their actions, ever with their foot in the air; inclined more to revenge and homicide than to theft --- for I have never seen one of them condemned as a thief at the parlement. Yet, since they are poor and needy, and too proud to go begging, they find themselves all too ready to yield to the devil's deceptions. The women, for their part, given over to idleness because they have little to keep them at home or to manage, and eaten up with deadly boredom, likewise readily surrender themselves to his promises; when he blinds their senses and holds out to them pleasures and marvels which would be their portion in his orgies and at his Sabbaths, and displays to them all his pomp and all his glory, so that they believe an earthly paradise will be their lot, into which only the most chosen and select will be admitted. Satan's greatest exertion is directed against the poor children, who, regarding the churches as true houses of God and the pastors as their protectors, fly into them as into asylums; these \[places\] are profaned, and the pastors themselves are found in part infected by the evil. Yet no other refuge remains to them, and one sees them sleeping in troops in the houses of God; and it seems to them that the devil has no power over them to tear them away from there and bring them into his accursed assemblies.

From that point the evil, spreading further westward, overspread the whole Spanish peninsula. About the same time that the French commission was at work in Labourd, striving by fire to cauterize out the cancer, the Inquisition in Spain did not remain idle and joined in the efforts. In November 1610 there took place an auto-da-fé at Logroño in Castile, which was solemnly held over those found guilty; a report of this act was printed at that very place, from which de Lancre gives a detailed account. Fifty-three persons were brought forward; twenty-one men and women went as penitents bareheaded, with a candle in the hand and a rope about the neck. The same number, with paper mitres on their heads as a sign that they had been expiated, followed them. Then the bones of five deceased persons, with their effigies, were carried, and six others closed the procession last, wearing the habit of Saint Benedict and the mitre on their heads, indicating that they had once before been released by the Inquisition. The five effigies with the bones, and the six who went last --- among whom Maria de Rocaya, distinguished above all as a mistress of witchcraft, stood out --- were handed over to the secular arm and burned in the fire. \[Page 73\]

Among the others were especially twelve sorcerers and sorceresses who had been tried; others were charged with different crimes. Of these, twenty-four were subjected to various corporal punishments; eighteen others, who acknowledged that they had associated with witches all their lives and begged for mercy with tears in their eyes because they wished to return to the faith, were received as penitent and actually reconciled. They were from Navarre and the neighboring Spanish towns, and in part connected with the refugees from the French Basque country. As in this instance, so has the Inquisition throughout Spain --- the land of the ancient Priscillianists --- acted. Another focal point for France falls in the Alps, namely in the Dauphiné and the neighboring districts.

"The Dauphiné," Michelet says in his survey of the French tribes, \"lies like a fortress under the lee of the Alps, and its inhabitants are called Francieur by the Provençals, by which they mean that with them begins a series of Gallic tribes different from themselves; a series which thence runs through the lowlands of the Bresse, over the ridges of the Franche-Comté, and through Lorraine as far as Belgium. A vigorous spirit of resistance and opposition marks these provinces, and a stock of severe, analytical minds has arisen from them. A lively and free simplicity, in the manner of all mountain-people, which appeals to everyone, characterizes these Dauphinois; their women, in turn, are likewise distinguished by a manly, vigorous spirit. Old age is highly honoured among them; for their dead a funeral feast is held each November, and everyone is presented with his share of the funeral food, made of eggs and flour. Each year the land sends forth not only swarms of masons, water-carriers, teamsters, chimney-sweepers into the neighbouring provinces, but also hordes of schoolmasters descend into the surrounding plain to offer their services in the lower elements of learning to those eager to be taught. \[Page 74\]

The inhabitants of the lowland appear less noble, given over to demagogy, and inclined to satire.\" While the sea-facing Provence, and still more the inward-closed Languedoc, in their Iberian blood more inclined to pure, crude Manichaeism, which broke out in the Albigenses and drew its demonic nature from that source: in that other tribal grouping rationalism will predominate, and the dark streams will flow more for that reason. But rationalism, in the spirit of that opposition, tears itself away from the tribe of original tradition; grounding doctrine on free understanding itself, and morality on arbitrariness of the will. Thus the boni homines of the Middle Ages descended with the bands of wanderers from those heights --- westward into the lowlands of the Rhône; and eastward the Waldenses poured into their valleys. Such teaching is of course averse to all spirit-beings, but only insofar as tradition is rooted in them; if, however, it lends a hand to the preservation of its own existence, it by no means casts them off.

While, therefore, the misunderstanding of personal freedom in that land of the Allobroges through the fourteenth century was driven on to Turlupinism in the societas paupertatis and to the disorder of the Beguards with their saying, ubi spiritus Domini, ibi libertas, Calvinism founded its school of prophets on the heights of the Dauphiné. From there that school then spread further into the Cévennes, the connecting link of the Alps with the Pyrenees; taking root in the kindred popular spirit of the inhabitants there, and in the excitement which the revocation of the Edict of Nantes had aroused in them. All the symptoms of ecstasy in the course of the Cévennes war manifested themselves en masse in those mountains, and testify to a predisposition to clairvoyance among these peoples.

And as now the phenomena of heresy and sorcery likewise rest upon the same basis, so they too have there attached themselves to it; on the one hand, in one cluster rooted in Manichaean doctrine and a licentious life; on the other hand, in a second cluster based on intellectual, rationalistic pride and the bold defiance of the mountain peoples. Thus it spread over Burgundy and the county palatine, on the one side toward Savoy, on the other as far as Lorraine. Thus Remy at the end of the fifteenth century found the evil generally widespread there among a bold people, partly living solitary in the mountain forests, and, as his folk-songs prove, thoughtful and inwardly given to mourning, besides poor and meager; so that he felt called, within fifteen years, to hold nine hundred trials.

From there it spread down the Moselle into the Trier region, and by the Meuse over into Belgium and Flanders, where in 1459 a similar slaughter had occurred. The rest of France had by no means remained untouched; the plague was so widespread, or the suspicion so keen, that Crespet (de odio satanæ), in the time of Francis I, on the testimony of those involved, could set the number of those entangled in sorcery throughout all France at at least 100,000.

Parliamentary councillor Florimond de Remond, however, relates in chapter 7 of his Antichrist: vice is so common that the prisons, like the time of the judges, did not suffice; and horror seized them at the dreadful things they had to learn in the interrogations. Understandably, the confused spirit that moved this land also opened an outlet into England. The accusation in 1303 in Rome against an English bishop, that he had concluded a pact with the Evil One and, in the usual way, rendered to him feudal homage, shows that this had already occurred early. The teachings of Langham of Kent, Wycliffe and others showed that the heresies, in rationalistic as well as dualistic form, had likewise forced an entrance, and that those aberrations had thus also penetrated. \[Page 75\]

The religious agitation which, in the wake of the Reformation, seized the minds in this country as in Scotland, soon likewise loosened here the predisposition to the second sight, wherever it was found among the people. Patrick Walker, who wrote under Charles II, relates: that time was marked by wonderful visions in lonely, desolate places. In 1668 and the years about then those assembled at such places, when the Gospel was preached to them there, had the vision of pitched tents, about which men and women were gathered, and from which voices were heard.

Especially on the first night, when John Dickson preached east of Glasgow, the people, as they made their way to the spot, saw, off the road, such a vision; and a voice came from the tent which loudly cried: "This is the eternal Gospel; hold fast to it and confess yourselves to it, and then it will never be taken from you!" When they went up to it, everything was vanished. Others, who came along another road, heard in a sweet voice the 93rd Psalm begin to be sung; so that they stood still until the singers had finished. Still others, who had stayed at home in various places, heard the 44th Psalm and the 46th; so that, when the first returned, they received them with the words: "Where have you been so long? the place of the sermon was so near; for we heard the Psalm sung, and can tell you of the sermon." John Blackadder questioned many honest people about this, and they all attested to the truth of the matter. Likewise at Craigmad in Stirlingshire, where A. Stirling heard the 121st Psalm, and saw a white horse with a red saddle among the singing people; and in Darmead, where the 59th Psalm sounded. The people were at that time so excited that they believed of the bishops of the High Church: they had claws on their feet, and cast no shadows; the soldiery that pursued them wore impenetrable armor, and rode on horses which, like foxes, could climb the rocks; the justices of the peace, however, were believed to be seen in great intimacy with the demon. All these regions, moreover, were in the time of James also the scenes of witchcraft; the records and the parliamentary acts in England from 1541 to 1682, where the three last witches in Exeter at the gallows expiated, as in Sutherland 1722, give testimony to that.

Those two French stocks, the Pyrenean and the Alpine, have meanwhile, from their own soil, certainly modified and increased the evil; yet they by no means called it forth from their own ground: rather it came to them, with the general migration of history from east to west, from neighboring Italy. There, as we have seen, Manichaean and rationalistic heresies had earlier spread in the towns and in the countryside; to these the demonic disorder afterwards attached itself. In the continuation of the French Alps there dwells also an Italian people, comparable to the Iberian Basques and to the Gallic Dauphinois; full of stubborn spirit and courageous mettle, who, e.g. the people of Como, Bergamo, Brescia, etc., make among the best soldiers. Bernard Retegno, whom Pope Julius II in 1505 appointed as inquisitor, found records of the Inquisition concerning witchcraft in the diocese of Como that went back to 1350. So great was the zeal of the local inquisitors for the extirpation of the evil, that Spina relates: the number of those who annually fell under the investigation of the local inquisitor and his eight to ten vicars amounts to a thousand, and that in single campaigns as many as a hundred of them were burned. \[Page 76\]

In the nearby county of Burbia the bewitched had eaten children; the Inquisitor Cumanns was called upon by one of the inhabitants, who had thus lost his child, to intervene; as a result of the process he instituted, in the year 1485 forty-one of them were delivered to the fire; the others fled across into Tyrol. Camonica, the open spring-valley of the Oglio above Lake Iseo, is inhabited by a robust people, mostly composed of shepherds. According to Thevet all are mighty sorcerers who occupy themselves with incantations, and practise everything by the power of the simple means furnished by the vegetation of their mountains and valleys.

Theodor von Folengo in his Orlandino, first canto, stanza 12, mentions this magic-cry of the local people, which has been preserved down to our times. Around 1517 an inquisitor took note of it; the consequence was that many made satisfaction in the flames. The same bold spirit which may perhaps have led some from natural magic into the demonic would not, however, brook a procedure that, in turn, confused one of these magics with the other without distinction. The people took up arms, and appealed from the Inquisition to the court of the bishop. The bishop summoned the jurist Alciatus, as seems to appear from his writings, to report; the government in Venice intervened; the Council of Ten annulled the proceedings of the ecclesiastical court and ordered a review, whereupon the people quieted down.

A similar forcible self-help seems to be the outcome of an earlier incident in the diocese of Como, related by Bernardus Comensis. He tells, namely: When about fifty years earlier, that is about 1460, Bartholomew de Homate was inquisitor there, Lorenzo of Concoretio was podestà, and Johannes de Fasseto was notary, and they were inquiring into heresy at the Comacine place Mandrisio; one day the podestà wished to satisfy himself whether the heretics really and in bodily person went to the Sabbath, or only in imagination. He therefore arranged with one of the initiated that she should lead him to such a spectacle, and so on a Thursday he went, with the notary and a third man who had been summoned, to the spot pointed out by that woman. The three there saw many persons gathered round the demon, who had assumed human form, and how a great lord sat among them. At first, as Prieras adds to his version of the report, the master of the chair took no notice of the intruding strangers. After the meeting ended, however, he gave a sign, and then suddenly those present fell upon the spectators and beat them with cudgels so that all three died within fourteen days. The matter, Bernard adds, is still in many persons' remembrance in Como. That in these valleys the whole activity was likewise connected with the heresies, and that action against the evil, when it was shown by an impartial and dispassionate inquiry, had the mass of the people on its side, is shown by the following remarkable account which Giussano has preserved for us in the Life of Saint Borromeo. \[Page 77\]

The valley of Mesolcina, which belongs to Graubünden, was, at the time of this archbishop, besides the heresies and other evils already recounted, also filled with those who practiced malefices and witchcraft with the help of the demon, to whom the abandoned wholly surrendered themselves, and who now committed great and intolerable wicked deeds. By their sorceries and malignities they harmed both people and beasts; for they not only brought various sicknesses upon adults and children, but even sentenced them to death: and it happened that people and whole herds threw themselves down from the mountains; which caused the populace great distress and harm, all the more because they could find no remedy. In that year 1583 the communities therefore assembled the common council of the valley to discuss measures by which the evil might be remedied; and those assembled resolved to take refuge with the archbishop and to beg him that he would grant them counsel and assistance in this matter. They therefore sent some of the principal persons of the valley to Milan to lay the commission before him, and they were received by him very kindly; and, rejoicing that God was opening the way for him to be active in the service of these communities, he kindly promised them his assistance; and he offered to go personally into the valley in order better to learn of the situation and to take precautions for what was necessary. With this he dismissed them comforted.

He then considered the importance of this affair very maturely and cautiously, and judged it necessary first to send a judge under the name of an Inquisitor, who would, within the bounds of justice, initiate the inquiry against the malefices and witchcraft. For this task he chose Francesco Borsatto, a famous Mantuan jurist who had shortly before put on the clerical habit; and, drawn by the public reputation of the archbishop, had come to Milan to receive the holy orders from his hand and to learn in his school the practice of ecclesiastical discipline. Borsatto carried out the necessary investigations with great prudence and agility. He found almost the entire region infected by witchcraft; and, what is worse, he discovered that the provost of this valley himself, who resided in the collegiate church of Rovereto, was as it were the head and leader, after he had transformed himself from a shepherd into a ravening wolf. He therefore instructed the judicial processes, and conducted them with so much humanity and goodwill that he won all hearts, and was then able to dispose of all things according to his judgment.

These wise efforts proved very useful for the visit the Cardinal wished to make there, and served as the best preparation for greater matters. But since the Holy Man knew with what caution one must proceed, how fiercely one must contend with the infernal enemy, and what difficulty commonly presents itself in the destruction of evil diabolical arts, and still more of damned heresies, he deemed it necessary, after having in accordance with his custom first taken refuge in prayer, to choose some men distinguished by kindness and learning to assist him in various functions in his undertaking. Among these were Father Francesco Pignarola, a Milanese noble and very celebrated preacher, who afterwards became Bishop of Asti; Father Achilla Gagliardi of the Society of Jesus, a man of great authority and experience and an exceedingly learned theologian; and lastly Bernardino Morra, his general auditor, who was afterwards made Bishop of Aversa by Clement VIII, after he had in the most honorable manner endured many hardships for the Church. \[Page 78\]

After he had put all these matters in order, he left Milan at the beginning of November and went to settle in Rovereto, the chief town of the valley, where he was received with jubilation by the people there, from which he drew great hope for blessed fruits. When Borsatto had finished the instruction of the processes, he reported to the bishop. Since the latter now knew that people of that sort are very hard to advise, on account of the special friendship and the close contracts into which they had entered with the devil, he therefore tried, with great patience (supported in this by his subordinates), every means so that the bound ones might see their grievous errors, renounce the devil and his false arts, and turn their hearts to God. His efforts were not in vain; for he converted a sufficient number of them; at one time he was able to obtain more than 150 abjurations, who then confessed to him and received communion. Eleven old witch-women, the leaders of the others, who had wholly given themselves over to the devil, and who perhaps no longer deserved God's mercy on account of the exceedingly grave offenses they had committed against Him, remained hardened in their sin; and since all effort with them was in vain, they were delivered over to the secular arm and punished with death by fire.

The same obduracy was shown by the provost of Rovereto, who was the head of that wicked sect; and however much the cardinal and his subordinates labored, they could never soften that seduced heart to a true recognition of its faults. Therefore, out of obedience to the holy canons, they found themselves compelled to proceed, by public act, to his degradation, an act accompanied by the cardinal's tears and deepest sorrow; in which he also delivered a sermon to the people lamenting the offender in person, and expressed his oral regret that he was compelled by the command of the law to an act so far removed from his mercy and clemency. "You see, my sons," thus began the sermon, "the decision of the holy Church against her servants who have made themselves unworthy of ecclesiastical service;" and he then went on to show how unwillingly the Church, as the mildest of mothers, has recourse to such decisions. It cannot be told what care he took for the conversion of the heretics as well as for cleansing the people of their superstition; for he had spent much time in making these persons receptive of the truth. Even with the lowliest he showed the utmost patience, although some proved themselves most obstinate and gave him exceedingly unseemly answers. He did not, however, act as if he felt it, but persisted in his long-suffering and zeal to gain their souls for God. In this way he reformed that entire valley and brought it into a wholesome condition; a result that seemed more wonderful than natural.

The whole Italian chain of the Alps was thus, just as much as the French, infected by the same evil; and while this, in the direction of the Apennines, spread southward over all Italy as far as the walnut-tree of Benevento and beyond to Sicily, it likewise overspread all Germany to the north. In the Bernese territory, toward the end of the fifteenth century, according to the testimony of Nider, witchcraft was very common; and Peter of Bern, a secular judge, raged against it. The cited examples all belong to French Switzerland and the diocese of Lausanne; into these regions the evil had penetrated from Savoy, where the Inquisition at the same time found itself much engaged. \[Page 79\]

But the German Switzerland was at the same time also seized by it, and Nider mentions an entire succession of reputed sorcerers in that region who, judging by their names, were of Teutonic stock. At the beginning of the fifteenth century there was, namely, a certain Scaf or Schaf notorious as such, who boasted that he could, in order to escape the hands of his enemies, turn himself into a mouse; nevertheless he was killed by them by an unexpected assault. His pupil and the inheritor of his secrets was a certain Hoppo, who is also known to Sprenger, and who in his turn initiated, in the third generation, one called Stadelein, whom that Peter in turn burned. They boasted of making weather, of shifting grain, of smothering children; they could render men and cattle barren, strike the horses under their riders with madness; ride through the air, repel their pursuers with stench, disclose hidden things, see into the distance, and foretell the future. The authors of the Hexenhammer, Sprenger and Institor, likewise found much work in German Switzerland, and from there, by way of Basel and Strasbourg, traced the tracks that led to the Lower Rhine; whereupon Kalteisen pursued them further into Belgium and Holland. In East Franconia the evil showed itself at various intervals, and from 1627--29 the flames consumed 158, among them 14 curates and five canons. To Austria and Bohemia the Lollardy had already, at the beginning of the 14th century, carried over its Manichaeism, to which a century later the Hussite rationalism was added; no wonder, then, that the demonic practice went over with it and now infected the whole North, which had already been prepared from the Netherlands by the Stadingher; and in Friesland, Mecklenburg, East Prussia, everywhere now, in the midst of the Protestant lands, the funeral pyres flared up. The plague penetrated even into the Scandinavian mountains; after it had earlier run its course in the region of Elffdale and the fire there had set its bounds, it broke out suddenly in 1669 and so in Mohra and the surrounding places, and the inhabitants begged the government for measures against the same, in order to restore the peace. A commission of clergy and laymen was sent there, and this, after it had examined all witnesses and taken statements, found that in the village of Mohra there were 70 witches who had seduced about 300 children. Of those, on voluntary confession, 23 were \[condemned\], of these 15 were sentenced to death; 36 children had to run with birches, 20 with rods in their hands, for three Sundays in succession stand in the church doors --- a punishment to which those 36 likewise had to submit for an entire year.

Ethnographically determined nodes, in which the threads of the web of witchcraft spreading over the earth are entangled, are not to be mistaken throughout all this; and these points fall near those germ-centres to which the confluences in the forms of paganism attached themselves, and to which afterwards the newer heresy again established definite relations. The Orient is therefore also the first original point of radiation; and as the Alps pass into the Hæmus, and this into the Taurus and the Caucasus, so to the Alpine tribes the first germs of Manichaeism came from the Balkan peoples, and these in turn from the Taurus mountains and Lesser Armenia --- which finally run together in the cave of Manes, and the older Mithraic peoples of the yet deeper East converge. \[Page 80\]

The mysteries of demonic service have followed this guidance; other currents in other channels have joined them: and blood and temperament, and direction of thought, and circumstances in history have here and there taken them up preferentially, and the fire has run on in the innermost marrow of things, in the tinder that presented itself to it, and thus this solfatara in history has been formed. History has therefore taken them up here and there in preference, and the fire has continued in the very core of things, in the tinder that was offered to it, and thus this solfatara in history has been developed.

#### D. Morbid Intensification of the Predisposition From Within

If the predisposition is present in individuals at the outset, it then easily increases from within through subjective affections, and mysterious states develop in which the decision whether they were really formed in this way, or objectively introduced from without by an injurious influence, is subject to great difficulty. A remarkable story that occurred at the beginning of the 17th century in Danish Zealand at once places us in the midst of this mode of operation and the question connected with it. The mistress of the house in which the affair took place wrote down the report of it; and Brunsmann, rector of the school of Herlof, later published it and supplemented it from the judicial records of the town of Køge, near Copenhagen. The events occurred between 1609 and 1614, but the publication was first made in Danish in 1674, while a daughter of the household was still alive. Later the book also appeared in Latin under the title: \[Enarratio Cagiensis?\] sive admirabilis historia de horrenda cacodæmonis tentatione, quacum in urbe Coagio \[a most honest and most reputable family\] for some years was afflicted. Second Latin edition, enlarged and corrected, Leiden. Leipzig, 1695.

The affair created a great sensation on its appearance, and Becker in his Bezauberte Welt explained it in his shallow manner; on the spot no one thought otherwise than that the narrative, as the woman had written it down, was perfectly true; and Brunsmann, in the second edition, repelled the suspicion of any fraud having occurred with proper scorn. \[Page 81\]

"The demon," Anna begins her account, "called malum domesticum, first made himself felt when I once went to bed in the evening with my husband. We heard under our heads a sound like the cooing of a hen calling her chicks. Startled, we rose and told the matter to our friends the next day; who then advised that it was due to snakes and other natural causes." We therefore examined the bed, pillows, and straw sack most carefully, but found nothing. Soon afterwards one evening, when I went from the room into the cellar, I saw a toad on long thin legs as if coming from the door; but when, frightened, I called the household together, we found nothing. The following night my youngest child gave a terrible scream, and when the maid lighted a lamp to look after him, she herself went pale and said: the demon had attacked her; she therefore fell ill from that time on, so that we had to hire another maid for her service for half a year. My little eight-year-old daughter then suddenly ran, frightened and crying, to her father: she dared not sleep in the children's room, for at nightfall there always came a strong man, in a silk garment, with a mustache and frightful eyes, before whom she was terribly afraid. We scolded her for her timidity, and she had to go to bed. But when her father had left her, she broke out into great weeping and screaming; we hastened to her, and found her deathly pale. She then became ill, and caused food and drink to be expelled again through her lips; yet she afterwards recovered.

Soon after my husband had to travel to Germany, and two weeks after his departure a great terror came upon our house. A young man, called Jakob, a nephew of my husband, began to be beset with fear by the spirit of temptation. For when he went to bed at evening he began to lament and to cry, and said he could not sleep in his room because of the demon and the ghosts. So we made his bed in ours; but when he lay down there he began again to bewail himself; and when we ran to him his whole bed trembled; and the boy's eyelids were so widely torn apart that they could not be closed or brought together by anyone; his mouth, however, was so tightly shut that no one could open it. After he at last came to himself and began to speak, we asked him how he was. He answered: God knows it; to me it is unknown. At last sleep came over him, so that he rested the remainder of the night, and slept until the tenth hour on the following day. On rising, however, he looked so corpse-pale and emaciated that it was a terror to all. That evening, as he stood at the table during supper, I said to him: Take something to eat, Jakob! Lie down, and commend yourself to God's protection, so that you do not again behave as on that accursed night, whereby we all were thrown into terror, and finally must leave the house! As I spoke these words, the doors of the chamber and the kitchen were torn open of themselves, and so violently that they struck against the walls; the youth, however, was torn from the room into the hall, where he was raised two ells high into the air, hanging suspended; without anyone present who supported him or held him aloft. His arms were stretched up, his eyes wide open, his mouth drawn together, his chin twitched up and down as if it were about to be torn off. \[Page 82\]

We tried with all our strength, grasping him by hands and feet, to pull the one hovering down; but the limbs hung so motionless that we could not even shift him or move him from the spot. We therefore all, kneeling in the hall, called to God that He would remember His mercy. Then the youth was released and set again upon the ground. But his mouth was still closed so that he could not speak, until we made him vomit with a silver spoon. Then he sighed, and his tongue was loosened, and his speech restored; and when we asked him how he was, he said: I hope that, with God's help, I will now grow better; for when you called to God on your knees, he went away, and moved from the well to the wood-pile. When I asked, "Who has gone?" he answered, "Satan." When I further asked whether he had then bound himself to Satan, he burst into tears and said, "You do me a great wrong, mother, in holding me capable of such a crime; my years have not taught me such things!"

While he spoke thus, a great noise was heard in the entry-hall, and a monstrous voice was heard, which however no one understood. The young man said: it is the voice of Satan, who speaks with him. At that moment a great fire flared up in the entry-hall, running about here and there. The young man said: Satan had spat the fire from his throat. We then took him into the room and read to him from God's Word until two o'clock after midnight, whereupon sleep at last came upon him, which lasted until the eleventh hour the next morning. He was, however, soon assailed again, and the terrors in our house increased day by day; all the more because I kept the matter secret until my husband's return. Of him Satan said: he had dogged him for fourteen years, but on account of the great man (so he used to call God), whose assistance he invokes day and night, I could do nothing against him; instead of him you are now delivered to me! The young man wept as he told this, and lamented that he had ever set foot in Denmark; for he was a German, and his temptation by Satan grew worse and worse thereafter.

At times he crucified him, bowing his head and crossing his feet one over the other, as Christ is represented on the cross: then no one could bend him, or move him from the spot, or alter his stance and appearance; he turned the whites of his eyes outward as if he were dead. At last my blessed husband returned home, and was informed of what had occurred. He caused prayers to be said for us in the town and the neighboring churches. He appointed the three successive Sundays as days of penance for the whole household, on which none, neither man nor beast, should eat or drink anything.

On the first of those days it was as if Satan would force in the windows, and the young man wailed that he would carry him off through the open window; the Evil One also appeared to some as a raven, to others as a goose. --- For a month the afflicted one had not slept soundly; now he began to enjoy some rest and awoke cheerful; likewise nothing had occurred in the house during the whole night, and the awakened man related that during the night his angels had told him he would get better. Yet he announced at eleven in the evening the return of the Evil One, who indeed appeared and remained with him until Easter. \[Page 83\]

No place in our house was in the meantime free of spectres; to some of the household he appeared in the likeness of Mr. Johannes Knuse of Karslund, or of H. Mathias in Herfögle; to others in that of a merchant, a dog, or a pig. The face and hands of some swelled so that they were no longer recognizable. Our children cried out and lamented at his appearing. One, only two years old, tore at his hair and pointed with his finger to the spot, crying, "There! there he is!" Jacob usually felt his approach in advance, and then urged us to remove the boys. The maid of our neighbour I. Mejer had once also come here with her master's boy; Jacob had warned her, but she had refused to heed the warning; her face and hand swelled up so that she was no longer recognizable. We had taken in a poor woman in the evening; but the enemy, appearing in the form of a local burgher, so frightened her that she could not compose herself. \[Page 84\]

A little white puppy lay in our parlor; it was lifted by the head and struck against the floor, though no one was visible who could have held it. It then hid itself under the bench, and was drawn out from beneath it by the head, and, resisting with its hindquarters, was dragged along the floor. The next morning it was frantic, tried to bite everyone who came to visit us; and we were obliged to kill it. When at last the time came in which the tormented young man was to be freed, he rose in bed and wrestled with Satan, using God's Word for the conflict; he recited many prayers that the neighbors we had summoned listened to; finally he lifted his hands to heaven and cried out: Now be God praised, who has delivered me from Satan! Then, turning to the other side, he extended his hand to someone we did not know and said: Hail to you, angel who standest at the right hand of God; forsake me now never, whether I travel by water or by land! He spoke other such words, reached out his hand again after kissing it; then wrapped himself in his blanket so that we saw nothing but the crown of his head; and we heard him, like a small boy with a clear voice, sing: Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth to men of good will. Now he rose up, and was completely well again; before, without our help he could do nothing, so bent and contracted was he, and he could not straighten himself up; henceforth he felt nothing more of all that affliction, and we were joyful and all thanked God.

But God, in his unfathomable counsels, sought to visit us even more harshly. My husband now began to be assailed day and night, harder than anyone can imagine; namely from eleven o'clock in the morning and evening until two o'clock after noon and after midnight. It began when I had stayed at home from the Sunday service because of a boy's illness; thereupon such a terror seized us all that we altogether fell upon benches and chairs, or upon the floor. We came to ourselves again, and after we had prayed the evil vanished again. The maids and the children, however, again saw apparitions; and my husband, who had already been sorrowful for three weeks, became all the more downcast when he learned of it. Once, when I adjured him by God to at least tell how he was, he collapsed; and when he came to himself again he said: God, who is always gracious and merciful to those who call on him, may he also be mindful of me and of ours, and bring us help! So sorely am I pressed by Satan day and night that heaven and earth seem to lie upon me with their weight. You will not long have me with you further as a husband, and my children will soon be orphans. From that time on he was harried more and more fiercely; according to his account something lay upon him daily at that hour like a sack of fruit; and at times swellings, as large as hen's eggs, would break out at his side. I again had prayers held in the churches, and also drove by carriage out to Mr. Johannes in the parish of Norderup to solicit his assistance. But when, on my return, I entered a wood the carriage became so heavy that the horses could scarcely move it; the trees crashed about us, something as high as a tower rose up before us, and a dreadful voice was heard which we could not understand. When I, having come home, went to bed and, my right hand bowed over my head, fell asleep, it was as if a mouse were gnawing my finger. However I cried and for a quarter of an hour tried to pull the finger to me, I could not; the finger seemed dislocated to me, and although nothing could be seen on it, yet I could not move it for a whole month. \[Page 85\]

On the following night, when I lay in bed with my husband, a heat seized us, as if the bed were standing in flames; so that we could not sleep. But when we rose the next morning, there lay on the lower sheet, from the pillow to the feet, a hanging of filth, two and two as masses united in a link of the chain, as if they had been strung on a thread, and so numerous that one could scarcely see the sheet beneath them. Our neighbors looked on this in amazement. Ingeburg, the wife of Mejer, who had come over, heard a loud laugh but saw no one. When she, frightened, withdrew again, my husband fainted. We brought him to bed, and sat in the front room until the ninth hour; but when I then wished to go to bed, he was no longer in it, and at last we found him in a small room, weeping and lamenting. This continued until it finally ended as the whole affair had begun: in my husband's head-pillow, into which the spirit had thrown itself, and from whose lower side, when it was removed, it had torn a piece out of the covering so that the feathers flew about the whole room. My husband was then freed.

When we gave thanks to God for this deliverance in the churches, our nine-year-old son fell ill. Yet we could not fathom his sickness; he said something living ran through his body, gnawing at him here and there. We tried baths and other remedies, but he grew worse. A surgeon we consulted likewise could give no explanation, and directed us to a woman versed in healing who at that time visited our town. She said the boy was possessed, and that nothing would help but prayer. Meanwhile, as the boy lay in his willow-woven bed, the bed together with him was lifted two ells into the air and was moved hither and thither. When I therefore called my husband, the boy had meantime been pulled out of the bed and stood on his head, his feet turned upward and his hands outstretched; so that we could hardly get him back into bed. Something continued to run through him; his body sometimes swelled horribly, his tongue was thrust out of his mouth, and then again was wound up like a cloth, while blood pressed through his lips. His limbs were drawn so together that four strong men were not enough to pull them apart. He grunted like a pig, clucked like a cock, and howled like a dog. At times it carried the boy onto the beams of our room, or on a pile of wood, and left him there; so that he did not know where he was and wept bitterly. It also threw him over the wall into the gateway of our neighbor Mejer. Sometimes it drew his eyes and cheeks so far back into his head that they were no longer visible. The boy became rigid like a log, and we set him up in this condition against the wall, where he then stood motionless like a statue; so that even the most hard-hearted were moved to tears at the sight of him.

Once, when I myself was at the evening sermon on a Sunday, it ill-treated my mother, who had stayed at home; the spirit, taking my likeness, pulled her shoes from her feet and struck her with them. She therefore received me on my return home weeping and with bitter reproaches. Although women the next day assured her to the contrary, she could scarcely be persuaded until the spirit, speaking from the boy's mouth, told my husband about it, adding: Had the Great One permitted it, I would have treated her so that the whole town would have wept for her. When we in the evening prayed the 46th Psalm, he neighed like a horse to it; he spat upon my husband's face so that it ran into his beard. He placed bare knives upon my breast; but when I said he should strike in the name of Jesus, the knives fell to the floor. He said to my husband: Be not too hasty, you will not drive me from here until those who brought me here receive their deserved reward! That is the will of the great man; even if I am a liar, he at times compels me to tell the truth. I would wish the time were already come when I could leave the house. When my husband asked when that time would come, he answered: Only that great man knows, not I.

My husband, after having borne so much himself and for his family, was now delivered from all misery; he himself passed to the other life, and left me alone, entangled in combat with the raging enemy, who would not cease to speak from the boy's mouth. The affliction continued for two years after my husband's death. Magister Glostrup held prayers for us in the church, often came to our house, spoke with Satan, and reproved him harshly. He also tried to speak with him in Latin; but the reply was: he would not burden his head with Latin. At last God would not permit him to continue his persecutions; he had to desist, and our house became as free from spectres as it had been before --- for which may the holy Name of God be praised, who does not abandon His own in their distress. I have written this down as a memorial of what happened in our house, and it contains, so help me God! the pure truth.

This is also known to M. N. Glostrup, then our pastor, now Bishop of Opfloe; likewise to P. von Duebrodere, Bartolo Foannis; to Peter Mann in Ferse, to the pastor Jakob in Nordrup, Caspar in Roeschild, Lorenz in Liemarch, Nicolaus in Vallensby --- several of whom still live, others are already dead. Magister Nicolaus had the boy in his house for half a year; the boy afterwards recovered, once the authors of our misfortune had expiated their guilt, and lived until the year 1620, when the great mortality carried him off.

One might, on reading this account, imagine that every member of that worthy family went mad in turn; but it would not be proper to attribute the participation of all the named pastors to the influenza as well. The censor of the book, Fan Berharod, who, after reading it, believes it will help to confirm Scripture's teaching about demons, likewise must not have escaped the contagion. Then there are the two burgomasters of the town, father and son, and the senator Pomeyer, who officially and before God declare to the author Brunsmann that there is no reason to suspect fraud in what is contained in the woman's report; that they have had the truth of the matter confirmed by their predecessors, and that it also appears as such in their records, which they have placed at his disposal; they too must be regarded as having suffered from the same malady.

The circle of this strange mental disorder grows still wider when one reads the extracts Brunsmann has made from these records. The householder Barscher had taken suspicion of the authors of the mischief in his house, and this suspicion had fallen upon Johanna Thomana, with whom he had formerly been in business relations --- relations he broke off when she was accused, by Christina Capserin (who had been executed for witchcraft), of being implicated. Her grievance had been increased when he had pre-purchased a house on which she had bid. For this reason he had taken an advocate, and by him caused the suit to be prosecuted before the town council. The investigation was instituted and carried out; on 8 June 1612 sixteen judges of guilt were appointed at the Ting of Køge, who are named in the records. They were charged to pronounce only such judgment as, according to the laws, they could justify before God and men. From 8 June until the 3rd... \[Page 86\]

The trial lasted through August, during which the lay judges, their hands laid upon the Holy Scripture, declared: As we desire---may God and His holy Word prosper us for good and for salvation---so in this matter we could find nothing otherwise than that Johanna Thomana had been the cause of the mistreatment of the servant in the service of the merchant Johannes, who is reported as possessed; and we can see and discern nothing else than that she is in truth guilty of diabolical sorcery. She confessed, and was executed on 11 September. One sees that the lay judges had judged according to their conscience; and one must believe that they had previously verified all the factual circumstances that underlay the case. Whether, however, they judged rightly in attributing the evil --- that is, the objective influences --- absolutely to that cause, is another question which we shall consider later in general.

In general there are many and various complications into which a person falls when the disposition for night-visions, which sleeps within him, is awakened and, by a particular un-favorableness of the providences of his life, comes to full development and makes him a suitable instrument to receive inspirations from below. We shall cite only one example of such a talent of a negative character which, as one easily sees, with some cultivation could readily have been brought to considerable virtuosity. In a neighboring region, where at a famous pilgrimage-site all sorts of human afflictions converge, and where, therefore, exorcism is also practised as a remedy for one kind of them, the contemporary exorcist made the following experience, which he roughly set down in manuscript in the following words; and which, by the uncanny intervention of spirits into that disposition, may furnish an immediate transition into the next consideration.

In Holy Week, 1836, three brothers of Protestant confession came from Rheinbischofsheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden --- Jakob, David and Friedrich --- bearing a letter from a Catholic parish priest from the Lower-Rhine Alsace, who recommended them for exorcistic treatment because they, their younger sister, and their whole household were continually tormented by evil spirits. From the conversations I had with the three young men in consequence, roughly the following emerged. Descended from common peasant parents and occupied from youth with agricultural work, they had always been healthy and strong. The eldest, Jakob, learned the smith's trade; the second, David, entered service in the army; the third, Friedrich, always remained at home. While Jakob was still abroad, David was one time seized by a very strange condition: he felt as if blown upon by a wind, and such a compression arose on his chest that he began to spit up blood. He was medically treated and was sent to the hospital in Karlsruhe; but all remedies applied were in vain, and he finally received his discharge. Arrived at home, his condition was not at all better, and at the same time extremely strange things happened in the house and in the stable. At the same time Jakob, while abroad, had begun to perceive what was going on in the paternal home; and now the younger brother Friedrich soon also began to be tormented, just like David; and also a younger sister, though not to the same degree as the brothers. In the house there were intermittent rumblings and bangs in a dreadful manner, and in the stable the cattle perished in an unnatural way. When the brothers went across the fields or drove with the cart, stones were often thrown at them from the air. Sometimes, they said, a thunderstorm suddenly stood up in the clearest sky; and on several occasions an unknown animal walked ahead of them and then, at a certain spot, suddenly vanished. \[Page 87\]

Physically Jacob suffered little, but he was a kind of visionary, and saw, as he said, the fiends coming. A moment later the brothers would be as if smitten by a breath, and feel an inner motion that increased to the point of hemorrhage; yet so that, when the attack had passed, they felt their strength restored, as if they had never lacked anything. Often it seemed to them as if they were beaten by invisible but still palpable hands; often as if they were pierced through the belly. They ascribed these things neither to the devil nor to actual spectres, but to wicked people. The seer insisted that he had positively recognized the apparitions as persons still living and even related to them; and the strangest stories were adduced in proof.

They had at the outset sought diverse medical help, but found none anywhere; what wonder, since they sought to drive out sorcery by sorcery, and went to those who were reputed to practice such arts. These assisted them on several occasions by sympathetic means, but only for a short time; because, as they alleged, the helpers were better paid by the others. What opinion I should draw from all these accounts as to the real ground of the matter I did not know. I regarded the two younger brothers, David and Friedrich, as hysterical; for their condition, especially that of the latter, pointed to a high degree of suffering. They otherwise appeared to be anything but timid, superstitious people; so that, since I noted they were Protestants --- among whom such things, especially in that district, occur even more than among Catholics --- I was inclined to ascribe the whole affair to a play of the imagination; yet on the other hand their calm narration, their ingenuous answers to embarrassing questions which I put to them, utterly disabused me of that view.

After I had at last deliberated, and after I had to some extent explained to them the meaning of the church benediction, I gave this to them repeatedly once or twice a day. They testified that they felt easier, indeed they seemed entirely free from their plague. I therefore dismissed them in Easter week with a letter to the pastor who had sent them to me; in which I begged him, in consideration of my ignorance concerning the true nature of the affair, to make on the spot inquiries into the relations of the family, into the circumstances of the people among whom they had been raised, and in general into everything that might throw light on the matter; also himself, notwithstanding the general prohibition of exorcism, at least to employ the exorcismum probativum.

At the beginning of June the brothers, to my no small astonishment, returned a second time and brought with them a letter from the pastor, who wrote that he himself had gone to their parental house in Bischofsheim; that he had there examined and investigated all the circumstances, but had discovered nothing significant as to the cause of the matter. He had had the brothers examined by physicians, and these, as the enclosed certificates showed, had detected no bodily disease. Twice he had written to the Vicar General for permission to perform the exorcism; but the latter had only answered evasively. He had now blessed the house, and it had indeed been freed from all haunting; the half-dead cattle were now well too; only the three brothers continued to be tormented, and he therefore repeatedly begged me to apply the exorcism. The medical testimonies ran as follows --- first, that of Dr. Kühn: the three brothers had, several years before, suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage and had been treated by him; but the prescribed remedies had been without effect, because the causes of the ailment could not be sufficiently ascertained. \[Page 88\]

Secondly, that of the physician Humann in Herrlisheim, who declared that he had examined the brothers stethoscopically, but had found nothing in them that pointed to an organic defect of the sick person, or to a physiological disturbance of the functions of her body as a whole. The brothers, once they reached me, now assured me that when they had left here on their earlier departure they had remained free of all attacks for two days; upon which, however, the evil had returned, and they were again as before in distress. During their previous absence everything at home had been topsy-turvy; there had been terrible noise, and all the cattle in the stable had seemed as if they were about to die. The distraught father had at once run to the Catholic pastor for help; but since he was prevented from assisting personally he had given him blessed palms; and when these were burned in the stable the animals immediately became healthy and rose up well.

The pastor had afterwards come and blessed the house again, whereupon nothing adverse had occurred since. Only they themselves suffered from the old malady, and begged me piteously to help them, since they firmly believed I could. I had therefore to return to the work, whether I wished to or not, which weighed on me greatly because of the obscurity of the whole affair. I had them tell their stories again, I asked fresh questions, I had them set their answers down in writing; but I could come to no foundation, any more than the first time. Their accounts partly confirmed what had been stated earlier, and partly added new details.

I have again forgotten many things; I will therefore set down only some of what I have written from Jakob before me. He wrote: when he was yet away in foreign parts, a man often came to his workshop by day and by night who showed him how matters stood at home; he always demanded that Jakob should throw money to him, and he would show him what he could do. If Jakob then wished to leave, he could not stir from the spot; nevertheless he was not otherwise prevented from working. The matter soon took a worse turn: the visitors became more numerous; they planned all sorts of things with him, and forced him to swear at night; he often had to carry coffins, was himself laid into them, or had to dig up corpses. They crucified him; but when it was over it appeared that it had been nothing.

Naked women appeared, carried out all manner of mischief with the others, sat on his face, etc., whereupon he then had actual pollutions. They would also have carried him off, it was to him as if he went out through his own eyes, and they led him to games and debauchery. They showed him how they had poisoned the well-water at home, and promised that if he married one of them they would make it right again. Thus it went on as in madness, and when the apparitions presently threatened to devour him, shot at him with pistols, beat him, tore one another's hair, then again came driving up with carriages and horses; another time a man loaded with golden and silver chains would appear and two golden rings would be placed about his arms; when they then rode with him into the clouds, climbed Mount Sinai, gave him nine golden keys, made three garments, set up a white bed before him; meanwhile again firing cannons, making music, launching an assault on Paradise, and desolating and destroying all things --- who could be wise after all that? He complained that these phantasms appeared to him almost every night; whereupon, every time, certain afflictions befell the other brothers. \[Page 89\]

He also wrote much about this, from which, however, likewise nothing rational could be drawn; the assertion remained steadfast: the principal persons were close relatives; among others, the father's sister, a notorious woman, with her equally notorious daughter. It was precisely this latter who was to marry Jakob --- but he did not want her. Even their own pastor was said to have been among the fiends. The thought occurred to me: since that notorious aunt had christened all three of them, perhaps the first cause of the evil had been laid then; and for that reason I renewed with them the baptismal vows. I continued to pray with them, instructed them about the churchly benediction, and pronounced it over them.

At last I resolved also to speak the exorcism contra maleficia over them. I can cite nothing remarkable of its striking effects; for the fact that Friedrich once or twice perspired under it, so that the sweat fell in drops, could well be explained by his suffering state. They likewise assured me this time: after each prayer over them they felt lighter, but it would come back again anew every day; it already brought relief when they were even only in the convent. They always thought: if I took it to the highest degree, it would surely be better, it would be altogether well. Almost three weeks thus passed, but no thorough help had been attained; the people's money ran out, and by their long absence from home the accumulating tasks demanded their presence ever more urgently; I could not and would not detain them for a single moment with empty promises. I therefore dismissed them with a letter to the pastor, in which I communicated to him everything that had occurred, and how I had never found a sure sign of a demonic influence. That the exorcism had remained without effect might well be due to the fact that the young people lived outside communion with the church; this defect could indeed have been supplied by my faith and my trust; but since that is only a divine gift which God bestows on whom He will, no one could accuse me on account of the lack of success. A magnetic treatment by a reliable and religious physician might perhaps be advisable in this case; the pastor himself might also, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, privately, and without telling the people what was going on, apply the exorcism.

They went away with this advice, and the narrator, when he wrote this down, had heard nothing further of them since. One must regret that this story could only be observed so incompletely and with so many gaps; for, had it been followed on the spot with attentive eyes for the requisite time, it would have afforded a profound insight into the nature of a most wondrous condition. As it stands, it appears as a popular, and, as one can hardly doubt, sincere report on the modalities of a disposition as it often occurs in witchcraft; and although it lacks sharpness of observation and the investigation of all the circumstances that occurred, it nevertheless, intelligible to a physiological tact, affords many revelations.

It becomes clear from this account: the house of these people, with everything that was bound to it in some relation, has been transferred out of the natural state in which it previously was into a counter-natural one; in which other laws than those of ordinary life prevail. In the midst of this new condition stand, to begin with, the three brothers, who had previously been healthy and strong, but are now reduced to a hectic appearance; and to them the younger sister attaches herself in the first instance. All are united to one another in a physiological bond, and within it stand in reciprocal interaction. \[Page 90\]

In this association --- and thus also drawn into the shared suffering --- is also the household's stock of cattle; which, so to speak placed at the circumference of the sphere of action, nevertheless, according to the testimony of the pastor, takes part in everything that occurs within it. Within the house itself things happen that wholly belong to the domain of haunting, and, however one may explain them, they show that this domain has been pushed to the border of two spheres. At the apex of the solidaristic connection stands the first-born; against his will he has become clairvoyant, farsighted and foreseeing; he therefore sees through the whole relationship that attaches itself to him as the members to the head.

Immediately beneath him stand the two brothers, again placed like members to the central organ; they are not seeing themselves, but when he becomes seeing they appear affected; they are, in relation to his knowledge of their condition, as if breathed upon, and are at once seized by an illness in which this knowledge becomes real in them. Congestions of the lungs appear which end in bleeding from the lungs; whereby, after the termination of the attack, as in all maladies of this kind, the powers rapidly restore themselves. The younger sister is also, though less deeply, drawn into this relation of action and reaction; the cattle, as if struck by the outermost emanations, give notice of their participation by rapid falling ill and recovery; and the haunting stirs itself each time as well, and seems to form the medium in which all those effects occur.

Yet the first impulse of the movement by no means proceeds from the centre of the association, and the knowledge of the deed is not realised by the deed alone; rather this realisation also comes to it from elsewhere. Even the clairvoyance Jacob possesses is not entirely his own; there is a man who comes to him and shows him things as they occur. He finds himself bound and held by its power, although it does not prevent his work. It seeks to master him, and employs against him alternately terror and bribery. Desire too it makes its ally; involuntary sympathy it is able to extract from him, only the accession of the will is lacking; and yet all this likewise shows, as the crucifixion does, finally as a haunting.

Opposed to the household association there thus stands another association, which actually effects the realisation, and this association is of demonic nature, its head being that objective apparition; for even the church's actio in distans opposes it and hinders its effect. The members who belong to this counter-association stand in a certain relation to the house itself; it is the ill-famed woman who took the brothers through baptism; it is the pastor who baptized them; it is the woman's daughter who suggests marriage to the seer, and who draws him out with her own eyes, as she had previously bound him, and leads him to play and feasting.

From this counter-association, then, issues the realisation of what is seen; it is the hostile demonic principle that works in it, and it is by no means strictly necessary that its members be aware of the particulars of the matter. They need only, perhaps by their moral demeanour, stand to that principle in an ethically sympathetic relation of some depth: and this principle can, by virtue of the will-less natural force that lives in them, make use of them as instruments to exercise its effects through them; as the like may happen through any natural mischief. Just as this kind of evil, exercised by the haunt-spirits in the frightful manifestations, nakedly comes to light; so, in those fable-like ghostly proceedings, the haunting has only entered into these persons and has personified itself in them. Thus the whole points only to an order of things higher and more intensified than that in which the foregoing phenomena stood. \[Page 91\]

There have occurred there the spooky (spukhaften) events, without their actual inner cause having come into view. Here this perception, as clairvoyance bound to the disposition, found itself appended. Now the thus-perceived world presses upon the seer, so that he who hitherto has behaved passively will now also put his will into it, and truly unite himself with it. He resists with all his might, but give such a disposition likewise the perverse will that meets the impulse, and one will fully understand that a tacit or express compact may come to pass. Merely for this reason, because the episode marks a moment of the advance on the path of deepening into the region of night, we have inserted it here, notwithstanding the fragmentary and obscure character in which it has remained for want of keen observation. If the natural disposition is lacking, then it will, in the further advance along the road of evil, be artificially evoked by those natural stimuli of which we have spoken in detail elsewhere.

Nature also has its orgasm, which first manifests itself in the plant kingdom. When the spring sun in that kingdom awakens the sleeping natural impulse, and this then, overflowing through the plant's veins, raises the swelling green toward the warming star, until finally in the blossom the driving force pours itself into fertilization; then those juices and compounds are mixed and boiled out in which the orgasm that produced them rests enclosed, and which, when brought into a higher organization, imprint in it the same quiet natural frenzy that begot them. This intoxication, which in the lower nature expresses itself plastically, becomes in the higher, nervous nature a sensory image which, arising from the sea of senses ordered in the circles of dizziness, opens the murky prospect into higher regions; and, if oft repeated, at last produces in organs thus frequently carried away into intoxication the facility even, in the absence of the exciting agent, of setting themselves from within into that drunken state. That these states, when evoked to evil ends, are directed immediately to the ultimate object of all these ends, and that the Sabbath with all its appurtenances then always stands at that goal, we have already learned from the manifold statements of those who were in such a case. Those, however, were mostly women, and indeed such as belonged to the lower ranks, where self-deceptions of the grossest kind might be suspected. Therefore, in order to supplement what has been said above, the experience made by a man who belonged to the higher ranks, as Prierias has preserved it, cannot be passed over here.

After the author in the first book had established the possibility of demonic influence in an Aristotelian fashion, and the reality by means of the Malleus, he relates at the beginning of the second book: A marvelous event was wont, as experienced by himself, to be told by a resident of Piacenza; who, if he has not recently died, still belongs as a Benedictine monk to the congregation of St. Justina, and there bears the name Jerome. This man, then still worldly, had a love affair with a girl whom he had won with the help of a sorceress; in return for this the sorceress had him promise to attend the Sabbath. She contrived it, however, in such a way that he kept his promise. Naked, he anointed himself between the hand and the arm with a certain salve which she had given him, making at the same time a certain sign which she had taught him. The same was done by the teacher and by the girl whom he had already abused. \[Page 92\]

All three were at once lifted up and carried away through an opening in the roof; and he, as it seemed to him, was sitting on a swift horse. Thus they reached the walnut tree of Benevento, and indeed with such speed that the quickly cleft air sounded about them with a sharp noise. Beneath the tree thousands were gathered; a scant light illuminated the scene, and they amused themselves in many ways. After the merriment had ended the witness returned by the same way home, and on the journey he saw many rivers and places, among which he especially noted Venice, which he had never before seen; and later, when he visited it, he recognized again what he had seen in that vision, which also occurred to him with other places. Having returned home, he was---after he had indulged in the pleasure with the girl---horrified at what he had done; and either kindly by nature, or because God had mercy on him, he confessed everything that had happened to the bishop or his vicar, and returned to the Church; who then received him into that order in which he probably even now leads a pious life. Whoever wishes to have full certainty in this matter may turn to Brother Andreas of Genoa, a man of great learning and pious conduct of life; I cite him here as a still-living witness. From this example it becomes clear how everywhere the rinculum must join to sin's clairvoyance in order to impress upon the condition the character of the demonic.

The free, conscious will, in its downward aspect, has two sides in us. With one it is directed toward all that is unconscious in our life, and through this toward the bodily. This unconscious in us, subject to the law of necessity, leads us, if we follow this necessity back to its very source, out of ourselves and over into external nature, which is wholly obedient to its law. If we then proceed further within it, following the direction of this law, we are finally driven toward the innermost unity at the center of this nature; which receives this law from a higher power above, and binds all that is its own downward in it. The will is, in everything that it must accept as inevitable, likewise bound in its expression by this unity; and what is allotted and apportioned to us has obtained its measure from there. \[Page 93\]

The same will, however, just as it is set toward God by all that has remained good and uninjured in us, is with its second, downward-going side directed toward that which has entered into us as corruption. In this corruption clings that moral fatality to which everyone succumbs who gives himself up to sin; so that, bound in it, he delivers himself over to that servitude which every sin exercises over the one who has become its servant. If we follow where the bonds of this servitude lead us, we are likewise led out of ourselves into an objective world of evil; and in tracing the traces of the inner connection in this realm we are finally driven toward its innermost concrete unity, in which all the radiations of that ethical necessity converge as in a focal point; a unity which we are accustomed to designate as the root-like evil by the name of Satan. Now if the unconscious in the individual becomes conscious and clairvoyant through temperament and the development of life, or through art, then it comes, freed from what binds it in ordinary life, into closer intercourse with outward nature; the roots in which it connects with her become sensorially potent; but it is thereby by no means demonic. Only when that other side of the will, which descends into corruption, joins to it---when this corruption sharpens in that somnambulistic loosening, and the clairvoyant faculty is made to gravitate toward that other center---only then does the demonic appear.

Every sinful thing which, adding itself to the mass, increases the fund of perdition, then acts as a means of appropriation and as a band that strengthens the pull of the radical evil; so that the operation of the same, in ever-accelerated motion, grows as it approaches. To the loosening which Nature has effected in somnambulism there then attaches that other spiritual factor which effects the ethically nocturnal influence; the entanglement becomes ever deeper, and the encompassing ever more narrow. To the feudal tie into which man at first places himself with the evil principle succeeds the relation of that principle's absolute autocracy in him, under which the lost one has sunk down into unconditional bondage.

### Chapter 3. The Meeting and Confrontation of Humanity and Evil

In the foregoing we have surveyed the ways which, from the evil side, lead up to the threshold of the spirit-realm. Now the question presents itself: How is the enclosure that surrounds man broken from without inward; or how is the barrier which shuts off that realm overthrown from within, so that the two realms may have closer intercourse with one another? Demonic asceticism has already answered this question for us in general; we need now only demonstrate the particular application of what was there said.

#### A. The Approach of The Spirits. Again the Kobolds

\[Page 94\]

Two modes there presented themselves to us in which intercourse between the two realms can be mediated: namely, either the invisible realm presses into the visible, or the latter intrudes into the former. We found the first beginnings of their mutual approach where the region of night, as it were with its outermost hem and limbus, passes in a kind of half-shadow into the region of light; and the depth, overflowing as if in jest and caprice, mingles itself in a coquettish, ironic, at times humorous fashion with the play of life. It is the region of poltergeists and kobolds, of the Norse tricksters and the folletti of the Italians, who here produce the arabesques of this half-dreamlike realism. These beings may in part be what they appear to be --- the demonic and harmless plays of a middle world lying between light and darkness, in which the jesting wit that lies in things, and reaches down into the seriousness of nature, tries itself out in burlesques --- Bambocciades that make sport of the respectability of life's prose; but something else may lie at the bottom of it. All wit in itself is already of twofold nature, and the corrosive fire of sarcasm shows how far down one of its veins draws; and the wittiest of the old Norse gods, Loki, is also the most malicious --- his name already expresses the consuming blaze of his demonic temperament. The harmless may therefore be only a mask to conceal this temperament; and then these will-o'-the-wisp forms will furnish the most suitable agents for linking day and darkness. All experienced and discerning exorcists therefore warn against the deceptions of this errant and confused world of hauntings, and forbid entering into any confidential relationship with its ambiguity. Stephan Colett has allotted a whole section of his writing to this subject. "I speak here," he says, "of those spirits commonly called in Italy folletti or household spirits, and whose familiarity one must shun as one must shun that of the evil one. They begin this familiarity with teasing: small things from the domestic circle are stolen, especially such as belong to the one to whom they have attached themselves, and are then mostly returned to him; so that everything seems to be an innocent game. But it is precisely against the playing, flattering spirits that one must guard oneself most. To some they appear visibly, in various forms, by day or by night, or only at certain times; to others they never show themselves." Mostly, when they make themselves manifest, they are of small stature, hop about in the corners of the room, laugh, make a racket, steal to the beds, and pull the coverings off the sleepers. Such beings do not wish to possess the person they pursue; they only press themselves upon him for intimacy, most eagerly upon women in the bloom of life. They are wont to promise them something, express love for them, bring them now this, now that, and are then most commonly visible in the shape of a handsome youth. At first the person suspects no guile or deceit; but woe! if she is thus pursued and does not immediately put the adversary to flight --- as happened to the one of whom I am now about to tell.

Not long ago a country girl came to me with her father, who told me how the evil spirit had insinuated himself into her confidence in such a fashion. He had appeared to the girl more than once in the guise of an ugly man, and had then followed her as she fled. At times he stole something from her, especially bread which she either had with her or had laid elsewhere. Whenever the bread portions --- the people were poor --- were set down, it was always the portion that fell to the girl, and no other, that was taken, and most often the stolen thing was brought back as if in jest. The same happened with other things that belonged to her. But the girl was ashamed of this game, and so were her parents; for they mistrusted the outcome. They therefore soon came to me and earnestly begged that I free them from this burden. I instructed the good girl, in the presence of her father, in all that was necessary; then I commanded in the name of Jesus that the demon should no longer show himself, should steal nothing more from her, nor otherwise be troublesome. And so it happened, and the girl still lives today unmolested by all demonic temptation. All of this are not dreams, for those awake do not dream; nor phantasms, which do not as a rule occur to persons of full understanding. \[Page 95\]

The attaching (or attaching itself to the young) was also observed in many other instances, in the two cases of which M. speaks in the following words. I recall the following incident in Bologna. A certain citizen, who had much to do in his house with spirits, so that he had to consult theologians, and the matter itself came to the ears of the local bishop. Whatever one did, one could not get rid of the pest. He was, as people believed, in love with a girl of the house; followed her wherever she went; played a thousand tricks and jests around her; and whenever her mistress, in whose service she stood, did her any harm by deeds or words, he immediately caused some mischief in the house. Once, when he learned of some ill-treatment received by the girl, he was enraged and tore a dress from her from head to foot. When the girl was greatly distressed at the damage, he restored the dress in such a way that one would by no means have guessed it had before been so torn. The household, who wanted to be rid of him at any price, at last --- on the advice of their neighbours --- put the girl into a state such that one day she ate beyond all measure. That enraged the invisible one; and after he had previously made his displeasure known to the girl and the householder, he left the house.

Likewise there befell another citizen the same thing. With him was also a girl of about thirteen years with whom the spirit had to do. He played pranks, and sometimes caused great damage by breaking jugs. He piled up stones and threw them down before the master's room, so that the house seemed about to fall into ruins, and no one in it felt secure in his life. The householders tried all manner of things; "they themselves led me," says Menghi, one day into their house, "showed me their affliction, and conferred with me about means to remedy the evil." But although many strove, none succeeded in removing it; until the girl left the house, whereupon everything grew quiet.

It is understandable how a continued confidential intimacy with such originally ambiguous, then decidedly manifest beings may, in the end, lead to an alliance for particular ends --- an alliance which in such cases is by no means merely one-sided. Extremely remarkable from this point of view is that maid who, one of the last, was executed in Salzburg about the middle of the previous century on the accusation of such an agreement. The report is contained in a letter drawn up in the Latin language by a member and superior of a religious order, dated Salzburg, 8 March 1751; and which, for many reasons, the Italian editor to whom it was addressed says deserves the fullest belief. He, however, reports the case in these words:

The notes concerning the execution of the accused that were requested some months ago could not be given until now, because P. G. N. had not yet received them from the councils and judges. Having returned from Rome, I asked a privy councillor of our prince for inspection of the proceedings; he did not give me the process itself, but only related the species facti \[the outline of the facts\], as contained in the enclosed sheet. From this it will be shown, it seems to me, that one in the matter has acted neither too credulously nor too hastily. As to the verdict, matters in Germany are disposed of in few words, which run roughly as follows: "Since you are convicted and confess to the crime of witchcraft, we condemn you from life to death, that you be executed by the hangman with the sword, and that the body be placed upon the pyre." The following narration of the facts reads thus:

It was the 23rd of January in the year 1749, when in a smith's workshop at Mülldorf, in the Salzburg territory, they perceived how the objects there suddenly moved in an unusual manner; sometimes the tools, tongs, hammers, etc., at other times pigs' feet, pieces of brick, and sometimes also objects that had not before been seen there, flew about and fell down. One man was struck from above by a hammer; another by a flying brick --- however, everything so lightly that whatever fell seemed to have lost its weight and therefore caused no pain. All wondered at this; some were seized by fear, thinking readily that something supernatural was afoot. Only the smith's maid, named Anna Bayerin, who served there as nurse to the child, laughed and said that she feared nothing and that no harm would come of it to her. Clergy were called to bless the house and to free it from the devil's assaults; but there was no remedy until the said maid was ordered to leave. As soon as she was out of the house, it became quiet again. These occurrences, and new disturbances which took place in another house where she passed the night, caused the local magistrate to have the more respectable citizens sworn concerning the facts, and thereafter to order the imprisonment of that maid. I do not wish to defend the interrogations made of her to the hair, or to claim that they were entirely in accordance with law; nor that the confession of the accused always bears the stamp of probability. \[Page 96\]

The following, however, cannot, without prejudice to the truth, be denied. After the interrogation had, at least for the sake of precaution, been begun again from the beginning --- and that without the torture having even once been threatened either at Mülldorf or at Salzburg --- this crafty, and not, as some falsely spread, simple woman, after many evasions at last made the following confession: She said she had been seduced by a seamstress from Neumarkt (a little town between Öttingen and Landshut), and had devoted herself exclusively to the Devil by the words written in blood: "I am yours and you are mine!"

She further confessed that she had committed a sacrilegious abuse with the Holy Host, which she had often received and immediately taken from her mouth; that she had several times been carried off, by the Devil's help, to nocturnal dances together with her teacher, the aforementioned seamstress, and others; and that she there had received a lump of sugar, which she afterwards threw into a peasant woman's vat. Thereby it came to pass that the cream of the milk --- however much trouble one took in churning --- nevertheless did not make butter for over half a year; until the peasant woman --- who swore to all this on oath --- sold her cow and bought another; whereupon she made butter without difficulty from the milk of the newly purchased animal, while the purchaser of the old cow likewise made butter from that cow's milk. Finally, she declared that, with the Devil's help, she alone was the cause of the disturbances in the smithy.

I am not one of those who take delight only in the new, often to the detriment of the truth; nor have I sworn by the ancients, who are often credulous to the point of superstition. I know that the judges of past centuries, of whom it is told that they frequently condemned the accused to the stake on mere confession, are charged with a hasty and credulous procedure in matters of magic. Nor is it unknown to me that sugar is ascribed the natural power to dissolve cream so that no butter can be made from it. Nor do I mean to deny that the nocturnal dances and journeys from place to place are not always founded in truth; rather, especially among women, they are represented to them in dreams by the help of the imagination, so that when they awake they cannot be dissuaded from them.

However, just as I cannot, without exposing myself to presumption for want of reliable information, either approve or still less condemn everything that our predecessors have done; so it is nevertheless known even to those who otherwise know nothing that the public laws, and among them the penal procedure of Charles V, condemn magicians to the fire; and that only a hardened and unwise person could call their existence into question after a many-hundred-year calm observance. That the use of sugar, without the Devil's assistance, may, now and then, hinder the making of butter from milk is comprehensible; but that a small piece should possess such power that it could spoil a vessel for more than half a year --- a vessel which in the meantime had been cleaned several times --- and exercise these powers so long that the cow which had been in possession during the application of the sugar could not be sold, no reasonable person will concede. Whoever believes that those nocturnal dances and flights through the air really took place as often as simple women tell, and that they themselves were present at them, may be considered even more simple than the women themselves. \[Page 97\]

Only when reasonable witnesses, elevated above all doubt --- several of whom were present, awake and by day --- testify from what they saw with their own eyes that they were led away in their presence, and that they with their own hands drove them out of the house; if now against this authority of ocular testimony one man asserts: this never happened; I know that such a one, as one who shamelessly and without reason denies everything according to his own liking, as they say, deserves the philosopher's rod of correction.

Among the others those also seemed to me foolish, and asleep with open eyes, who, wishing to gain renown from the novelty of an empty shadow and to embrace a vain appearance instead of the truth, assert that the said seven witnesses might have been deceived in the repeated interrogations, by believing that the hammers and tongs moved without human hand, that they struck them and yet did not wound them; although they testified separately that they had seen these movements in no way caused by the above-mentioned maid, nor in any other way than a supernatural one. For with the same presumption I might then assert: a man who has been robbed only, carried away by his fancy, imagined this, but never possessed the stolen things; the thief dreamed the crime, and the witnesses were falsely persuaded that they had seen the theft.

It should be noted that the Bavarian seamstress, the teacher of the woman from Mülldorf, taken in at Neumarkt, confessed under the same circumstances that she had seduced ours and that she had gone with her to nocturnal dances; although neither could have had knowledge of the other's confession; whereupon she was also beheaded, and the body burned on the pyre. Nevertheless one might well have hesitated at Salzburg to condemn the other merely on account of the agreement of the confession, if the credibility of the witnesses had not testified to the materiality of the crime and removed all reasonable doubt; so that the truth was as clear as humanly possible. Yet no one should consider the maid simple; for by way of deceit she tore out a leaf from her prayer-book, which she had with her in prison, scratched her skin with a piece of wood instead of a pen, and wrote with her blood: I am yours and you are mine! --- with the intention of making it believed that the devil had restored to her what she had previously given him. She carried this off so slyly that it almost succeeded and one would have believed her. Nor should it be overlooked that both, the woman from Salzburg and the one from Neumarkt, at least to all appearance, received the announcement of the death sentence cheerfully; and both humbly requested the assistance of clergymen for their impending end and strengthening with the holy sacraments.

But even in this, as P. Laymann wrote a hundred and some years ago as something common to gentlemen, they were alike: that each of them, on the day before the punishment was carried out, complained to one of the assistants that she was being condemned unjustly, and sought counsel whether, under such circumstances, she should suffer the death-penalty or should proclaim her innocence to the judge, even though without hope of pardon.

The report here given appears sufficient to form a general notion of the course of events in this affair; but it is not detailed enough to get to the bottom of the matter. That those Folettis played a prominent role here is plain; the fact itself, even if --- as we have seen --- it were no more than sufficiently corroborated by its frequent recurrence, would here, in matters that concern life and death, have been completely proved by the judicial testimony of seven authentic witnesses. \[Page 98\]

Even the remark already made about the moment of motion in the throws that proceed from those hurlers --- by virtue of which a momentum, despite the great speed with which considerable masses, hammers, &c., travel along, yet sees its force, contrary to all physical laws, dwindle into a ghostly minimum; as if absorbed mass and movement, instead of strengthening one another, rather mutually --- would make the matter credible.

The woman who stood opposite them had the life-course, manner, and physiognomy of an old-fashioned witch. She herself had made a full confession of this, not extorted by the threat of torture. That confession had been corroborated by that of the other woman at Neumarkt; and both, although completely independent of one another, in different places, and without prior collusion between the confessors, nevertheless agreed with one another. The two women, the mistress and the pupil, had together, according to ancient custom, attended the Sabbath; and the bond of fealty had been sealed with blood in the formula: "I am yours and you are mine!" whereupon, likewise according to old usage, the story with the peasant woman and her cow occurs; and the sacrilegious proceedings with the host made the once-knotted relationship a lasting one.

On the one side, then, that ambiguous spirit-realm approaching in those enigmatic shapes; on the other, the woman of sly temperament, who mutually offered to one another their nocturnal aspect. That those spirits, in their fashion, clung to the maid seems certain, for the disturbance abated in the house and ceased when she was removed from it; but it appears to have recurred in the place where she again stayed overnight the first time. Whether, however, the relationship was truly a reciprocal interchange does not emerge with clear evidence from the material at hand. She herself, by her earlier boasting and her later admission, has taken it to be real; she, to whom, it must be admitted, the best judgment on the matter belonged, must therefore at least at that time have believed it to be actually present.

Here, however, indeed the possibility of self-deception with respect to the fact, or of self-delusion with regard to the consequences of the confession, comes into play. Just as she may later have fraudulently imitated her later statements, so the first supposedly real one might have been produced by self-deception; and the same relation between her initial boasting and her subsequent confession might, by still later denial, be annulled again. The reality of such a relationship must thus, in this case, since it is not proven by the account, remain undecided; but the possibility of it is evident.

The two circles of human depravity and spiritual perversion have drawn near to one another until they nearly touch; one cannot see what, if the approaching tendencies are mutual, should prevent their ultimate confluence. This confluence has, on the part of those perverting powers, been effected in innumerable cases in possessions; which are precisely nothing else than the breaking-in of these powers into the sphere of individual life, even where the latter, by the resistance of the will against such intrusion, keeps itself closed. There is no reason to state why, on the other hand, if that will is unanimous, from the side of the perverted individuality such a connection might not be sought, and this opened to the circle of spirits.

#### B. The Exercises of The Preliminary School

\[Page 99\]

As we have already seen, the practice of magic has kept its higher schools and its initiations under the rein of a certain discipline. An analogous example of what there had taken place there is afforded by the prophets' school which prepared the uprising in the Cévennes, and which, having arisen from more than ambiguous motives, permitted a conclusion as to the manner in which the affair there unfolded, where the leaders frankly and freely surrendered themselves to evil. The peace of 1682 had been very injurious to the cause of the Calvinists in France; by the thousands the people in the south had returned to the Church. The most resolute among its leaders had, in the following year, raised an insurrection in the Dauphiné and in the Vivarais; this, however, proved very unfortunate, and the chiefs had taken refuge in Geneva, in Holland and in Germany to seek help for their cause. Jurieu, one of them, had in 1685 written an exposition of the Apocalypse to prepare the minds; therein he announced the overthrow of the Church within five years and the return of the Reformation in France. This produced the greatest excitement among those peoples in whom the new principle is rooted; and the signs of ecstatic states which appeared here and there in consequence of it probably suggested to the mass of the exiled heads of the Confession in Geneva the thought of ordering and disciplining these states and of making them an ally in the renewed war.

The scene chosen for this prophets' school was a glassworks called Peyra, in the mountains of the Dauphiné, amid woods and rocks. At its head they selected Du Serre, one of the most determined Protestants in that district; he, a native of the country, being often engaged in the affairs of the works, frequently came across to Geneva; there meanwhile a committee had been formed which promoted the insurrection; and two preachers, Henry and Perrin, were sent over to stir the people by their sermons. Du Serre now had fifteen boys entrusted to him by his co-religionists in the neighbourhood, while the same number of girls gathered about his wife. First he instilled in these a pronounced hatred of the Church, and then he revealed to them: that God had communicated his spirit to him, that he gives it to every one according to his good pleasure; but that he had chosen them in order to transform them into prophets and prophetesses, if they would prepare themselves to receive so great a gift in the manner prescribed by God. The children, in their innocence, were willing, and had now to submit to a strict discipline, in which especially regularly recurring fasts, continued for three days at a stretch, played a principal role; while lectures on the Apocalypse and on the Antichrist in Rome, and his near downfall, directed their minds that way, and familiarized them with the language of the prophets.

Under this training there gradually appeared in most of the pupils the phenomena of somnambulism; they threw themselves backwards upon the ground, their eyes closed; the region of the pit of the stomach and of the throat swelled, and they remained for a time in this rapt state. When it had come to this point, then the master --- his apprenticeship being, as he said, at an end --- assembled the whole fellowship, placed the person to be proclaimed in the midst of the company, and told him: the time of his inspiration was now come; then he kissed him with a grave and mysterious mien, breathed his breath into his mouth, and announced to him that he was now receiving the spirit of prophecy. The others had witnessed, full of astonishment, the birth of the new prophet, and were moved by the longing soon likewise to attain, in like manner, to the same consecration. After he had thus absolved them all, he sent them out, each to his own place, admonishing them to bestow again upon others the gift of prophecy whom they found fit for it, and who had gone through the same training as themselves. Among the young pupils of the prophetic school two were especially remarkable: a young man of twenty-five years, Gabriel Astier, from the place Clien; and a young shepherdess from the village of Crêt, called the beautiful Isabelle. While the others remained in concealment, both of them, toward the end of the year 1688, chose respectively a larger scene of action; the one went over into Vivarès, the other to Grenoble, at the very time when the Prince of Orange crossed over to England. The Calvinist people were ready to believe the prophets who proclaimed to them the victory of their creed, and thus a great excitement arose in those regions. The vigilance of the authorities, however, prevented an uprising in the Dauphiné; the prophetess was arrested in Grenoble, and, afterwards being brought to a recognition of her errors, returned to the Church. Astier, in Vivarès, having grown more cautious, retired into secrecy, and first consecrated his whole family to the prophetic office, and then others; and when the matter nevertheless became notorious he fled to Boutières, into the wild, inaccessible mountains, and thence began to hold nightly meetings with the inhabitants.

On the mountain-tops the people gathered, in numbers ranging from a few hundred up to three or four thousand, sometimes at different places simultaneously; on the day appointed by the prophet men, women, and children assembled. The prophet stood among them in a raised place and opened the meeting with the loud cry: Mercy! Mercy! The people answered with the same cry, prostrate on their knees, and the mountains echoed it back. Then a prayer was said, and a psalm sung by all present. Now the presiding officer rose, the assembly did likewise, and after he had cried out, holding his hands over his head, "Throw yourselves backwards, without danger!" everyone threw themselves backward; while the prophet, as the number of those falling increased, let his arms sink lower and lower accordingly. The circumstance that sometimes three to four thousand persons thus hurled themselves on their backs without being hurt was regarded as a gift of the prophets. In the midst of the prostrate the prophet himself then fell into the ecstatic state; he was brought back to himself from this state by the candidates for the prophetic office who lay first around him; he then began to prophesy, and went up to the best-prepared among the neophytes, breathed into his mouth, and said: "Receive the Holy Spirit!" He at once surrendered his place to the newly consecrated man, who likewise began to prophesy and to communicate the received gift further.

That the matter did not rest on imagination and artifice, but was rooted in physical states, was shown by the shudders that seized those who fell, the contractions and extensions in arms and legs, the convulsions that made them foam, and the swellings they experienced. They also declared that the spirit communicated itself to them when they had previously taken the fallen upon their laps; and that it usually entered through the loins, which to them seemed as if made of iron. The country soon became covered with branches of the original school; a general uprising was to be feared, one which could easily spread over the whole south as far as Gascony. Serious measures were therefore taken; in the first encounter the delusion of the excited men was scattered: they were not invulnerable, nor could they, with the cry "Tartara," put the armies of their opponents to flight. Several other encounters followed, the armed bands were dispersed, Astier was taken and tried, and the province thus pacified. \[Page 100\]

Sparks of the conflagration had meanwhile been blown as far as the Cévennes, and in the year 1688 there was a first outbreak, which however was soon suppressed. But in the year 1702, with the outbreak of the War of Succession, the smothered flame broke out anew and raised the Cévennes War, which was led by the Prophets. They were here arranged one above another in four ranks. The lowest comprised the awakened; the second those who obtained the Spirit by the breath; the third those who obtained prophecy; the fourth those who simply possessed the gift, and were no longer occupied with worldly things, neither prophesying nor sitting on the council. All that had been seen in the time of the Manichaeans and the Anabaptists repeated itself anew in this memorable war, which the mountain people waged with great courage and resolution; wherein, however, they also all too often stained themselves with coldly calculated murder and cruelties, and fell prey to manifold deceptions; from which, as from the outcome of the whole enterprise, it equally proved that the spirit in which they trusted had not been a good spirit.

##### The Life of Magdalena Bavent

One may say here: the people fought for their conviction, even if erroneous, against a faith that had been forced upon them; and their leaders, though they made a grievous abuse of their power of enthusiasm, had at least for the most part passed through the same school, and had themselves been enthusiastic before they roused enthusiasm in others. But where from the outset pure depravity, recognized as such, lies at the root; where the leaders have given themselves over beforehand to the absolutely evil for its own sake, and now from it become seducers of others whom they wish to win for its realm: there the demon himself is present, and the whole act becomes demonic, and shows itself as such in its consequences. So it went in the tale of the seduction of Magdalena Bavent, which she set down in her memoirs, and which we will relate in her own words.

"Born in the year 1607 in Rouen, I lost my parents at about nine years of age; I was brought up by an uncle until my twelfth year, and then remained until my sixteenth in the house of a woman in order to learn to sew. At that time a convent according to the rule of St. Francis was established in Louviers, to which saint I had always had a special devotion. I therefore wished to be received there; my relatives interceded for me, and I obtained admission. I entered the convent with the intention, as I can swear on my soul, of serving the Lord there with all sincerity, and began my novitiate in that intention. But we had a terrible man who guided us, the priest David. He read with us the book of a Capuchin about the will of God; but he interpreted this in a most peculiar manner, in which our mistress-novices entirely agreed with him. Under the pretext of obtaining perfect obedience, which must also overcome the most severe and nature-contrary things, he introduced atrocious practices. He said: one must kill sin by sin, in order thereby to return to the innocence of our first parents, who before their fall did not know shame. Those among us were then regarded as the holiest and most virtuous who appeared quite naked in the choir and in the garden, and in that state performed dances. We were accustomed to touch one another; to practice every kind of unnatural sins as paganism had known; to abuse the image of the Crucified and the sacrament of the altar in every possible way." \[Page 101\]

The author took what he reports in this book partly from his own observation, partly from the records of the Parliament of Grenoble and from the testimonies of the arrested prophets, especially of the beautiful Isabelle.

At first I resisted these abominations, and was therefore regarded as a disobedient, headstrong, malicious, and refractory person, who was possessed of her own will. When once I was to go to Communion naked down to the belt, I had refused to do so, but I had to yield; when I wished to cover myself at the small grille with the altar-cloth, this was snatched away from me, and when I then used my hands to cover myself, David ordered me to fold them. My conscience kept making constant reproaches to me about all these things; David said these were not sins, and another confessor whom I asked for was not allowed me. I therefore left the convent; but inexperienced as I was, I took the position of a gatekeeper (pförtnerin) of the convent that was offered me; and so I remained, entirely given over to my indiscretion, in that office, albeit outside the convent, yet continuously connected with it.1) I had left at the end of January; at Candlemas David travelled to Paris, then returned at the end of Lent, and died on the Monday of Holy Week. Nothing had occurred between us, except for some licentiousness; but before his journey he had entrusted to me a little casket with the prohibition not to open it. Curiosity, however, drove me to disobey his command; and I found a paper in it, written by him in an unknown hand, but I returned everything to him on his return. I then tended him for a short time during his illness, which appears to have been a syphilitic sore; and on the day of his death he gave this paper to Mathurin Picard, and appointed him his successor in the convent, in his sense and spirit, and in a private interview recommended me to his care. This paper was the paper of blasphemies that was always used on the Sabbath. \[Page 102\]

\"So I was in the office of porter, but Picard was confessor and director of the convent. I had now fallen into worse hands than before; his insolence toward me grew quickly, and though I tried to defend myself against him, I could not; for he held me fast in the chains of hell. At Easter I was to make my confession to him; but scarcely had I begun when he would not hear me further; everything I brought forward he said were not sins. He feigned a passionate love that he harbored for me; he begged for reciprocal affection, and began to caress me. Since that confession I had no other kind with him; all were like that sacrilegious and damnable one. Yet I never loved that unhappy priest from the heart, and I do not know by what power he bound me to him and thus kept me bound. It is a misery when one does not leave to souls the choice of their confessor, and binds them to one who can ruin them.

Our relationship was known in the convent; even outside, many pressed to pull me out of the danger; but in the convent they would not allow me another confessor. It is true that I myself did nothing about it --- whether from timidity or a tendency to an unbound life --- which I ought to have done. He pursued me continually, and did not cease from me even in a violent illness, when I was senseless and more dead than alive. Yet because of my resistance he did not succeed in gaining his whole will with me all that time; except once, when he was ill, or only pretended to be ill, and then using force rather than persuasion he wrested my consent from me. What has been said about a similar occurrence in the church is, thank God, unfounded except for one attempt on his part.

That, however, was not the only thing he intended against me to rob me of my honor; there was another thing I did not suspect because I did not know his devilish arts. While I was ill he had me sign a paper whose contents I did not know. Once at the altar he put a host into my hand, and then, pressing my hand, he broke it so that the pieces fell to the ground. Likewise he wanted me to drink of the wine which he had left in the chalice after the completion of the Mass --- which I, however, never did. Once he said to me: 'My dear, I am building this church; after my death you will see miracles; will you not agree?' I said yes, without understanding the meaning of his words. \[Page 103\]

I was concerned only for my honor; he feared on his side that I might be pregnant: therefore he consented that I should go back into the convent, which was no difficulty, since he furnished a sum of money for it. I found there still the same filth in the novitiate as before, although Picard did not come and go among the nuns as freely as David had done earlier. Hardly fifteen days had I been there when he sought a pretext to come into the garden where I was with some nuns. He followed us, and after he had come to a certain spot he produced a host from a book he had with him; with it he picked up some drops of blood that had fallen to the ground, for I was then menstruating. He wrapped them up, called me out into the churchyard, and used my finger to push them into an opening near a shrub. He never spoke to me further about the matter; but I acquired a strong inclination to go repeatedly to that spot, and there I had many filthy temptations and practiced much impurity. Later --- I believe soon after I had taken my vows --- he demanded a copy of my profession; I wrote it while he dictated.\" \[Page 104\]

Then he said, when I was about to sign them, that I must now bind my purpose to his; if he should die before me, I must be willing to die likewise; if he were damned or saved, I must choose the same fate for myself. I was terribly frightened by this, and after much resistance I gave only an outward assent, up to, as I believe, the point of damnation. Meanwhile I continued to suffer many pangs of conscience, and I wished to make my confession to the confessor of the sick in the hospital we visited. Picard, who perceived this, hastened to put his design into effect. One day, when he handed me Communion at the grille, he touched my breast through the veil with his finger, and instead of the usual words said: "You will see what will happen to you because of this." I went to my place in the choir, but restlessness drove me into the garden, where I sat down beneath a mulberry tree. There appeared to me a cat which set its hind feet on my knees and its forepaws on my shoulders, and then barred its dreadful jaws over my mouth, as if it would take the Communion from me. Whether that actually happened I do not know; for I sat there for perhaps an hour, unable to make the sign of the cross or to drive the creature away. Picard saw me that same day, and when I asked: was that all the glory I was to receive that day? he answered: "You will see quite other things yet!" Two or three days later he said: "My dear! we have now seen one another; do you not wish that we should see one another again?" I said yes, to the ruin of my soul. In the night, about eleven, after I had already slept, I heard what sounded like a nun calling me. I rose, and when I reached the door I lost consciousness and felt myself carried to a place where, besides Picard, several clerics and nuns were present. He at once said: "Beloved, did I not tell you we would see one another again today?" I answered: "Yes; but I did not think it would be outside the convent; this assembly is also unknown to me." He said: "You must not trouble yourself about that," and so he drew from me a formal assent to everything that was there to happen and that he in particular would do --- the one and only formal assent he extracted from me. Yet my conscience would never be entirely pacified; Picard knew this well, and therefore never quite trusted me, nor did he ever initiate me into his secrets. The day after that event I disclosed everything to the confessor Langlois; whether he was aware of the matter or not, he did not tell me that I had been led to the Sabbath, and left me without counsel. Six months later I told him of my more frequent abductions; which was the easier to do because he had been given the monastery confessional, and Picard, on suspicion, had been removed from it. I had resolved to make a general confession, and had already made three quarters of it, when Picard learned of it and had me called to the confessional grille. He asked why I had stayed so long with the new confessor. I answered: to make a general confession. "Well," he said, touching my hand, "you have begun, but you will not finish!" He had spoken truly, for, as he afterwards confessed to me, he had cast a spell between me and the confessor; when I began, it was as if the confessor closed my mouth and drove the sins back. He seemed to be bound in my presence; I, however, as soon as I entered the confessional, was terribly tormented. It pressed down upon me with great force when I tried to begin; it struck my head against the walls and threw me to the ground. One could hear the blows I received; people saw me swollen and black and blue from them, without knowing whence they came. \[Page 105\]

After the Communions I was turned over, my feet pointing upward, and I was compelled to vomit up what I had taken. I wrote to Father Benedict, but the letter was taken from me. I wrote to the Bishop of Evreux; my letters, some of which still remain, did not make an impression until the fifth year of my torments.

If one considers this hair‑raising story of seduction, which embraces the events of many years, and in which many transitions may have dropped out owing to the unfaithfulness of memory, the horror that besets these depths of human nature will whirl and confound the spirit that looks down into them, unless it rests on the most secure foundation. If among the sacraments the Eucharist must be regarded as first, because it subordinates itself as the essence and core of the whole house of healing to its centre, then after it priestly ordination will follow first in order; for it must prepare the ways and the little rill in which the streams of this and all sacraments flow. Just as things stand concerning the sacraments in the Church of Light, so do they stand concerning the execraments in the demon's midnight church, in which the real substance of the sacramental is transformed into an ape‑like, lying mockery. Thus the deepest negation is implanted in the Sabbath's Eucharist, which therefore also holds the apex of these execraments; while the next place in the sevenfold order is occupied by the witchly ordination, which opens the ways through which the curse of hell comes upon the world. If now the consecrated of the Lord, priests and his brides, are to be transformed into the consecrated of the demon, his sorcerer‑priests and his paramours, then, before their luciferization takes place---to use the phrase of one from their midst---first their debasement must precede; only immediately, and indeed only after the full and unambiguous assent, the uncoerced joining of their will has taken place, will the reception and immediately the promotion to the priesthood occur.

To this end the asceticism that those priests of the abyss introduced into the novitiate was calculated: the novices were to pass, by an indifferent state of nature, into the contrary state, and sin was not to be combatted by good but to be killed by suicide through itself; so that, after shame, set as guardian, had been extinguished, the access of nature on that side would stand open. David had gone so far when Picard took his place. He had been pastor at Mesnil‑Fourdain near Louviers, and was regarded as a man highly experienced in the spiritual life. But, as Father Esprit du Bosroger, who knew him, related, he had been in league with a sect of false Illuminati; and he knew how to control his mien, gait, speech and all his actions so well that one might have taken him for an angel of heaven. His serious bearing, his downcast eyes, the long beard, the pallor of his face; the mildness of his words, to which those who spoke with him accommodated themselves; the warmth of his zeal, the measuredness of his actions, the restraint of his ideas despite all reserve, sometimes exalted by flaming words about God or Paradise; his sighs and his contemplative expression, the long duration of his Masses, during which he appeared beside himself; his prayers of thanksgiving interrupted by sobs and deep silence---all gave him the appearance of a great friend of God and a consummate spiritual man; and yet he was nothing but a great Pharisee and hypocrite, a wolf among the sisters of that convent.

He continued where his predecessor had left off. Nakedness, he said, was originally the sign of true innocence; for all sin is not in the body and in bodily actions, but in the discrimination of human craftiness. \[Page 106\]

"He who distinguishes is accursed and damned," says the Apostle; he who does not see sin has not committed any, for the spirit, closely united with God, has committed none. All human cleverness and earthly understanding, even shame, must therefore be mortified; the spirit must not crawl into reflections, meditations and distinctions about its actions; but, abandoning itself to passions and earthly faults, give them over to tear themselves to pieces in confusion, and then fly with the eagle to the sun.

No wonder that the woman Bavent, a spiritually limited but passionately bold girl, fell into the pitfalls of this gnostic; three or four others who had listened to him had, as P. Esprit relates --- who later for a long time was confessor in the convent --- the same fate; the others would hardly all have escaped him, had he not been led away by trials to Rome and Paris, and, after he returned, had not illnesses removed him from their path.

It is a general law of nature that opposites, so long as they are not abolished, only tighten themselves the more. Thus cold cuts most sharply when it meets increased heat in the organ, just as positive stimulants act most strongly on negative dispositions. The seducer proceeded by this law in his work. As the sacraments possess a sanctifying power, so there lies in the counter‑sacraments a desecrating one; the latter in an eminent degree where its effect is combined with the profanation of the former.

He therefore first abused the sacrament of confession, in order by it to tie on those physical bonds through which such things always begin; bonds which finally led to the satisfaction of his lusts, and, given the nervous state of Bavent, for example, as one cannot mistake, brought her organic life into magnetic rapport with him. Now further steps were taken to obtain the attunement of her will to the other covenant. At first he was content with forged signatures and ambiguous consents to participate in the new Church. Later he comes nearer to his goal by forming, with her blood contained in a host, a new vinculum that ritually binds her to him. Thereupon the taking of her vows, the analogue of priestly ordination, is used to allot the same to her in the church of the abyss, and to win from her a formal consent to a bond of life and death; only when the extension of that bond beyond death is to be made does nature recoil in terror. Therefore one now proceeds to initiation into the deepest mysteries of the night, and the Eucharist, the holiest thing, must be helpful to the unholiest. He offers it to her, and as she swallows the morsel, the evil enemy has also entered into her. She now becomes clairvoyant, and the cat that she sees, and afterwards the incubus that pursues her, is the first available expression of the new relation she has entered. The initiate is then --- but only after she has once more explicitly given her consent --- introduced on the Sabbath; where she must once again, in the circle of the inner life, give her formally and afterwards also in writing confirmed assurance of full attunement. She has made her covenant with the seed of the dragon; now only enmity must be set between her and the seed of the woman. \[Page 107\]

Therefore, when she looks back toward the church she had left, because the impulse to make her confession of sins in the confessional has risen in her, the evil spirit who has seduced her sets himself, in all his acquired power, between her and the priest. The ecclesiastical element awakens cramps and convulsions in the inward-turned nature, and she is forcibly prevented from the confession of sins and flung back into the mire. Thus an iron band has been forged about the unhappy woman, and a demonic-magnetic pull chains her to him who, as the representative of the evil enemy, stands opposite her.

Now if the simple force of nature --- that organic gravity and mutual attraction which runs through all life --- in vital magnetism binds the magnetized to the magnetizer, so that the latter lives only in the former, thinks his thoughts, and, from a distance and to a certain degree, moves and makes him act according to his will, then incomparably more must a magnetic natural force thus directed and rooted in her, and strengthened by the power of the demonic, take effect. One cannot say that the acceptance of such an irresistible force is incompatible with human freedom and moral accountability. For the prior surrender of that freedom is the absolutely necessary precondition before the efficacy of this power can enter; and even then, with the withdrawal of that consent, return and liberation are possible, though exceedingly difficult.

With the surrender of the will, therefore, this rapport immediately manifests itself in all its power; the one who renounces is entrusted with it to the foreign spirit, and at once a spiritual community of goods arises between them --- a common production of thoughts, in which he, in a state of demonic ecstasy, stands as father, and she confronts him as mother. That will be especially the case in the vision of the Sabbath, which takes its first origin from him; from him it is then received, and in her carried and brought forth into the night. It is therefore he who first called her to the Sabbath, and continually gives the initial impulse to the work. Invariably she thus appears to be bound to his person; she always finds herself near him, speaks with him, learns what is going on there, as it were through his mediation; the whole act appears bound to him, and has no existence without him. Thus, when he died, she was no longer led to him; she is a widow who has been made wingless, who can no longer get there by her own power.

Very remarkable, therefore, is also what occurred at his death. She relates concerning it: "When he lay in agony and I went up the stairs to the gallery of the sleeping-chamber, I saw Boullé (whom he had appointed his successor in office) enter the court as if he were going to the chapel, with a dreadful countenance. At the same time the window through which I had looked down to him was broken before me; and I had a demonic seizure, being dragged through the dormitory and very badly treated. When that same evening I sat in my cell, there was a violent knocking on the beams, and I heard in a hoarser voice: 'We have our booty!' It was, as I afterward heard, precisely his hour of death. Since he died, the steward of a monastery well known to me has always appeared to me at night, a man whom I had never seen at the Sabbath and did not otherwise know. He always urged me to break the promise I had given to Picard, to wish myself to the place where he was, and soon to follow him."

#### C. The Demonic Under The Mask of Holiness

\[Page 108\]

The swiftest progress along this precipitous path will be toward the goal when, as happened at the first seduction, the sensual delight of pride -- to be like the Elohim -- adds itself; and the presumption to risk everything that can lead to the gratification of each of the two. This, therefore, is the great danger that immediately presents itself at the divergence of ordinary life-roads, and which he who penetrates more deeply from there must above all withstand. For the natural way divides itself at this point of departure, in that what in it had been intertwined with one another there separates; and from thence two distinct ways proceed, each in a different direction: one of which rises upward to the light, the other leads down into the night.

Just as at the divisions of lands and waters, it depends on a small elevation or depression of the ground whether the waters flow to the north or to the south, to this or that sea; so at these great forks of life there works a thrust of the deeper nature which takes refuge behind pride, and the titillation at the call of holiness, so that the downward way is chosen; at first under the delusion that it is the one which leads upward. In place of the serpent of salvation and light there is then the dragon of the abyss, which, having seized its tail with its mouth and appropriated self-consciousness to itself; and as it illuminates with its false, glittering light the inner being that it entangles, the deluded one imagines himself to walk in the light of Godhead itself. Examples will here most clearly set forth this unhappy relation, and we cannot choose a more striking one than that which occurred in the first half of the sixteenth century in Spain. There lived at that time Magdalena del Cruz, a Franciscan nun in the convent of St. Elizabeth at Córdoba; born in 1487 at Aguilar, entering that convent in 1504, and, having rapidly attained to great reputation for holiness, chosen abbess in 1532 and again in 1536 and 1540; but in 1541 brought before the Inquisition, which then instituted proceedings against her. \[Page 109\]

A witness in that same process may be heard concerning the reputation in which she stood, as follows. "The good repute which she enjoyed made acquaintance with her desirable to me; for everything I was told of her excited my admiration, and I heard all the world speak of her holiness. Not only the people held this opinion, but eminent persons: cardinals, archbishops, bishops, dukes, scholars, men of the orders of every kind esteemed her highly. I learned in particular how Cardinal Alphons Maurique came over expressly from Seville to see her, and in his letters called her his very dear daughter; how the Inquisitors of Córdoba showed her the greatest respect, and how Cardinal Quignones, General of the Franciscans, made the journey from Rome to visit and speak with her. Also I myself had seen how Jean Reggio, the nuncio of the Roman court, had arrived in Córdoba to satisfy his curiosity; and our Empress, the consort of Charles V, had called her in a letter her very dear mother, and the happiest being on earth. That letter, in addition to her portrait as a memento that she should remember her in prayer, was accompanied by the veil and the baptismal shirt of her newly born prince, Philip II; for the purpose that she should pronounce a blessing over both. People spoke of her throughout Christendom; the preachers praised her from the pulpits, and all others paid her homage in the same way, without giving room to any doubt about her merit and her holiness."

She was the object of the most tender affection of all the confessors of the convent, and of the provincial of the order; and those who were furthest advanced in piety believed they saw in her way of life a new path to attain sanctity. In truth she was amiable toward everyone, loving with modesty, compassionate and so good an example that she urged everyone to serve God; and indeed her company led many persons to enter a religious life. Her skill in conducting affairs was so great that people pressed from all sides to hear her counsel, and her convent was comparable to an office.

Other witnesses who testified to the same matters also spoke of her ecstasies and her raptures; they brought up her prophecies and the prognostications she had made: among other things, how she foretold the death of the Marquis of Billen, the cardinal's hat for her order's general Quignones, the captivity of King Francis I, and his marriage to the widowed Queen of Portugal, the sister of Charles V. All this had led to a biography of her being printed even during her lifetime. So it stood with her outwardly, and now one may marvel at the labyrinths of the human heart: she herself appeared on the 7th of May 1546 at her Auto da Fé to hear her final sentence, after the secretary of the court had read the extract of her trial, from which the following results concerning her inner life emerged. \[Page 110\]

Magdalena had testified that when she was in her fifth year the demon had appeared to her in the shape of an angel of light, and had proclaimed to her that she was called to become a great saint; at the same time urging her to lead a devout life immediately. The apparitions had thereafter recurred often. Once the spirit had assumed the form of the Crucified and had urged her to crucify herself with him; which she performed with the help of nails that she drove into the walls. But when he then invited her to follow him, she fell to the ground and had two ribs broken, which the spirit, always in the guise of the Lord, afterward healed. When she had been seven years old, the demon, continuing the deception further, encouraged her to begin an even stricter life. Burning with great zeal, she therefore one night left her paternal house at Aguilar and went to a nearby cave with the intention of living there as a hermit.

The next morning, however, she had found herself again in her father's house without knowing how it had happened to her. One day the spirit, constantly pretending to be the Lord, married her, and as a sign of the union touched two of her fingers; announcing to her at the same time that the growth of the touched fingers would henceforth be arrested; which accordingly occurred, and she resolved to relate the incident to many people as a miracle. At twelve years old she was already regarded as a saint, and to secure herself in this reputation she performed many good works and false miracles. She had visions of spirits who took on the form of those saints she especially venerated; such as St. Jerome, Dominic, Francis and Anthony. In their presence she fell to her knees, thinking them to be saints; at times she even believed she saw the Holy Trinity and other extraordinary things; and all this only increased her desire to be esteemed a saint. When this vanity had at last become predominant in her soul, the demon showed himself to her in the guise of a very handsome young man, confiding to her that he was one of the fallen seraphim, and that he had accompanied her since her fifth year. His name was Balban, and that of a companion he had was Pithon.

He made her understand that if she continued to stand to him in the same relation as before, she could enjoy every pleasure whose notion her spirit could conceive; and that it would then be his business to spread still further the reputation for holiness which she had already attained. Magdalena accepted the proposal on the condition that she should not be bound forever, which Balban granted without scruple. There followed a formal pact with the demon, in which she promised to give herself up to his counsel. From that moment the spirit, as an incubus, clung to her, until the extrajudicial confession which she made in her convent in 1543. Once he appeared to her in a black, hideous form; and when she, terrified by it, cried "Jesus!" that drove him off. He, however, soon returned, vehemently reproached her for her mistrust, but then reconciled himself with her again when she promised not to be frightened again should he appear to her in the same guise; which thereafter happened several times. \[Page 111\]

After she had taken the habit, whenever she went to Communion she gave a cry and feigned ecstasies which her fellow-sisters took for real. On one such occasion her feet were pierced with pins; she did indeed feel the pain, but restrained herself so as not to lose her reputation. For the same reason she several times had herself crucified in her cell, and inflicted wounds on her hands, feet and side. With the help of her spirit she sometimes left the convent and visited some other place; there she saw everything that had taken place and then told it to others to display her secret knowledge. Once she was said to have been in Rome, and to have received Communion from the hands of a priest who was burdened with a mortal sin. Meanwhile no one in the convent noticed her absence; for Pithon had entered there in her form in her stead. Her spirit foretold to her many future events: for example the captivity and marriage of the King of France, the wars of the Communeros and other things; yet not all that he thus proclaimed came to pass. She fell out with him from time to time: once, when he had made to her a shameful demand and she had rejected him, he in his anger tore her up very high and then let her fall back to the ground; so that she was carried back to her cell in a very bad state.

With regard to the deceptions by which she contrived to set herself in the reputation for holiness, Majolus's account points more to supernatural states, only intensified on the wrong side; whereas the extracts that Florente made in his Wunderscheu rather seem to betray a crafty trickster who was at first deceived and then deceived others and herself. The former assures us: on feast days she was often seen hovering three or more ells above the ground. Whenever, on the appointed days, she went with the other nuns to Communion, one of the hosts --- previously and carefully counted --- was always found missing from the priest who distributed them; it was then ultimately found, visibly to all, in her mouth. Often she carried the image of the newborn Redeemer in her arms, showering it with her tears; and in doing so her hair had grown down to her feet, and in like manner gradually receded again. Florente tells either a different incident, or the same in another way, when he reports that she, in an abusive apprehension of a mystical idea, made the nuns and others believe that she had conceived the child by the Holy Spirit on the day of the Annunciation and had given birth to it at Christmas from light. She then wrapped the newborn in her hair, which then, black as it had previously been, became red; but the child left her some time afterwards. \[Page 112\]

People now wanted the hair as relics in many places, and she gave some of it to several people. One day, when she was in the choir with the nuns, her demon, it was said, came in the shape of a dove and sat close to her ear. She then told the sisters that it was the Holy Spirit, and they thereupon threw themselves down to worship it. She confessed that for eleven years she had tried to make people believe that she took no food and contented herself only with the Eucharist. But this had been false; for during the first seven years she had secretly eaten bread and drunk water, assisted in this by some nuns trusted by her. During the last four years she had eaten various things that others knew how to procure for her. In addition she had persuaded others to eat meat on fast days, or even to work on feast days, because it was not forbidden; she had also made those with whom she associated closely believe that many priests and monks kept concubines without offending God, because it was not a sin to have such companions. She confessed many other false revelations, apparitions of souls, angels, and demons; many false prophecies, healings, and in general manifold abuses which she had made of her reputation for holiness.

She had carried on her charade for thirty‑eight years with success; at last her pretence that she did not eat became the rock upon which she foundered. Some convent sisters had grown suspicious, looked more closely, and in the last year of her office as superior discovered the fraud. They revealed what they had discovered to the provincial, the guardian, and the confessors; no one would give credence to their statements, and all declared the accusation to be slander. On the day, however, when a new election in the convent took place, the party of her opponents gained the upper hand, and one of them was elected abbess. This happened in 1542. Until then the alms that had been brought to her had been immeasurable; and she had applied them to the advantage of the convent, which she had almost rebuilt from the ground up. Now, since she no longer stood at its head, she used what she received as she pleased, because the donors had left everything to her discretion.

In the following year she became seriously ill; her conscience awoke, and after hard struggles she now made a confession, by word and in writing, of all the deceptions she had practised. The letter of a nun dated 30 January 1544, in the records, gives an account of what took place on that occasion. The physicians had declared that her condition left no room for hope and that she must prepare herself for death. When her confessor appeared to prepare her to receive the last sacraments, she was seized by a convulsive trembling whose violence put everyone in alarm. She begged him to return the next day; but when the convulsions recurred that day and the next, the confessor concluded that a supernatural cause lay at the root of it, and he exorcised her. The power of the exorcism forced the demon to speak through her mouth. He said he was one of the seraphim, that at his side stood a companion, and that several legions obeyed him. He had possessed Magdalena almost from her birth, and was of the firm resolve not to leave her; because she belonged to him, and he lived in the hope of dragging her down with him into Hell. The confessor then gathered all the convent sisters and asked them, in their presence, to confirm what they had heard. She then declared that she had had several demons since her childhood, and that she had kept them willingly since her thirteenth year, in accordance with a pact she had concluded with them on the condition of attaining the reputation of sanctity. \[Page 113\]

She added to this confession the account of a host of particular circumstances that aroused astonishment. The confessor reported what had occurred to the provincial of the order, who arrived at the convent before Christmas 1513 with several other members of the order. The inquisitors of Córdoba, having been informed of the matter, now intervened in the affair and asserted that the investigation belonged to them exclusively. The provincial had meanwhile put himself in readiness to administer the sacraments to her; and arranged that she should sign in her cell a statement in which she confessed several of her deceptions. Magdalena then received the viaticum and thanked God that she had been able to perform this act without an outward and striking incident; although she nevertheless always doubted that God would show her mercy.

The convent sisters had withdrawn; Magdalena was alone with the one who had recorded all these circumstances in her letter, and who had stayed behind to make the preparations necessary for the Last Anointing. Suddenly the sick woman told her that she felt much better, expressed an extraordinary desire to take food, and urgently begged her to bring something to satisfy her hunger. When the sister now brought her some nourishment, she seemed to return to life with joy. When the confessor visited her, she wished to continue her confession orally; the confessor prepared to set it down in writing in the presence of Father Peter of Vergara. But Magdalena opened her mouth only to retract everything she had previously declared; whereupon the two priests left her displeased. The nuns then urged her, for the sake of her own peace, to make a sincere confession, and she at last promised them. The confessor then acted as if he were dismissing everyone; but they positioned themselves so that they could hear everything without being seen by the patient. Magdalena then made various declarations, the confessor wrote them down, and obtained from her the promise to sign the written statement in the presence of the convent sisters. They appeared at once; but as they drew near, trembling and convulsions returned to her. The confessor therefore resumed the exorcisms; the evil spirit again began to speak in her and declared that he still possessed her person. Finally, on the 14th of December the patient calmly repeated in the presence of the provincial the confessions she had made and confirmed them; and the agents of the Inquisition immediately arrested her and led her to the prisons of the Office.

To the circumstances as Florente here relates them from the records --- though of course only in extract, passing over everything that seemed to him incredible --- Majolus adds some others, which likewise have no other attestation than this very testimony. During the investigation the demon, who --- according to another reporter --- usually took the form of a Moor, by no means abandoned his outward performances; he was present at matins, to the astonishment and consternation of the nuns, in her form, and undertook many other ministrations on her behalf. The nuns therefore conceived such an abhorrence of their former abbess that, after an inquiry into her case, they by many entreaties finally brought it about that she be removed from the convent, so that the haunting might at last cease. \[Page 114\]

In order to judge how much cunning fraud, self‑deception and indeed demonic besetting on their part have cooperated here; how much the credulity and partiality of their surroundings have contributed, one would at the very least have to have the records themselves before one; and even with their addition it would be difficult to assign to each of these moments --- which probably all acted together --- its definite boundary. She was, moreover, condemned to proceed from her cell in the religious habit, but without veil, with a rope about her neck, a gag in her mouth, and a burning candle in her hand, to the cathedral of Córdoba; where a scaffold for her Auto da Fé had been erected, in order from there to hear the reading of her sentence, as well as the customary sermon that followed. The sentence ran as follows: that she should be enclosed in a convent of Franciscan nuns outside the city, there to pass the remainder of her days. She was to be excluded from the assemblies of the community, and exercise no voice therein; she was not to be permitted to wear a veil, and every Friday was to dine with the penitents in the refectory. Without the permission of the Inquisition she was never to dare to speak with anyone, her fellow‑sisters, the confessor, and her superiors excepted; and only after the lapse of three years was she to be admitted again to the Lord's table, unless in the case of serious illness. The sentence concluded that, if she transgressed even one of these prescriptions, she should be regarded as a relapsed offender, and as one who had renounced the holy Catholic faith.

Section II. Personal Conditions of Those Entangled in Witchcraft and Sorcery
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

He who, by any one of the previously described ways, comes to be bound to the principle of root‑evil has entered into a new circle of existence. He has, as it were, undergone a transmigration of the soul, and in making himself active in a new realm his whole nature and being must conform to the relations prevailing there, and be transformed in a thorough metamorphosis. For the new principle seizes him in all spheres of an existence into which it gradually penetrates; it masters them progressively more and more, entwines them ever more closely in all their members; and thus appropriates the whole more and more exclusively, remodelling it according to its own law.

But this transformation cannot begin unless previously the will of the one to be appropriated has consented, and the partition which is set between him and the hostile principle has itself been removed. This consent may well be procured from below; but it may also be the consequence of a free resolution which seeks its welfare by these unusual paths. In either case such a self‑determination, repugnant to the natural man, cannot occur unless peculiar conceptions have paved the way for it. There must be a peculiar perspective in force which, with regard to the standpoint of the entrant, misleads the optical relations of that realm; and while he threads its paths it confuses him more and more, leading him from one abyss to another. There must enter a special worldview which makes the friendly appear hostile, the hostile appear friendly; which lies to the loathsome by giving it an alluring side, and which knows how to make that which is contrary to nature acceptable to him.

Intellectual weakness laid the first foundation for such a worldview; perversion of the will fostered it; objective demonic influences from without strengthened and carried it forward; the sophistry of the human intellect straightened out that which contradicted it; and at last it has come about that human nature has learned, in an entire reversal, to make friends with the most hostile. \[Page 115\]

This is best shown by the self-confessions of one such person, who has come to the utmost by these ways; confessions from which the mimicking catoptrics of the great magic mirror are easily discerned, and which therefore may most fittingly introduce us into this investigation. These memoranda were written by Johanna Fery. \[Page 116\]

Born shortly after the middle of the sixteenth century, in Soignies on the Sambre, she then became a nun in the convent of the Black Sisters in the town of Bergen in Hainaut, belonging to the diocese of Cambrai. In the year 1584, when she counted twenty-five years, and Louis of Berlaimont was Archbishop and Duke of Cambrai, it was perceived and noted in her that she was possessed and taken by evil spirits; and the archbishop decreed that the ecclesiastical remedies should be applied to her. The struggle lasted nearly two years; at last she was entirely freed after hard resistance, and shortly before, in obedience to a vision, she wrote her self-confessions, which we here communicate in extract.

I know that by my father's curse I was delivered to the Devil. In my fourth year he appeared to me in the form of a handsome young man, desired to be my father; and because he brought me an apple and white bread, I consented to his request and took him for my real father. As long as I was still a child, I had beside him another who took care that I would not feel the blows when I was punished. That continued until my twelfth year, when, weary of the convent in which they had me educated, I returned to my mother. From there I was soon again bound out to a seamstress in Bergen, so that I should learn to sew there, where I then had almost my free will. Now my alleged father came to me, saying: because I had taken him as father, I must necessarily live by his will. Hitherto I had lived like a child; now, however, it was fitting that I live as he would show me; and like all people lived, even if they did not say so. If I did not do it, he would inflict upon me the pain which he showed me; if I consented to what he required of me, I should have silver and gold whenever I wished, and of food and drink whatever my heart desired.

At first I refused, then I yielded to him, and granted everything he wanted. Now a great throng of them appeared before me, whereat I was somewhat terrified, because I had never seen more than two or three of them together. They then made me take paper and pen and write down that I renounced baptism, Christianity, and all the ceremonies of the Christian Church. After I signed the document with my blood, they made me swallow it in a bitter orange. It seemed very sweet to me up to the last bite; that last bite, however, was so bitter that I could not endure it. From that time on I have been everywhere hostile to the Church, had a great dread of it, always sought to flee and avoid it, and to hide myself from it; otherwise, however, I have always lived in every wickedness and all sins.

When I had grown somewhat older and they began to speak to me of receiving the holy Sacrament, it was most abhorrent to them; and they tormented me almost until I promised them that, if I got hold of that, I would act according to their counsel and will. First I had to give and present my tongue to one of them, so that in confession before the priest I would say nothing more than what they deemed good. When I was to go to the Lord's table, they had made the holy Host altogether loathsome to me, and had made me abhor it; yet I was to comport myself with a false heart and flattery about it, as the others among whom I lived did. \[Page 117\]

Even during and throughout Mass I ate much sugar and confectionery, to the shame of the most venerable Sacrament. When I then received the Host at the altar, I immediately stepped to one side; and because, as long as I had it in my mouth, I was sorely tormented in my throat, I took it straight out and wrapped it in my neckerchief. At home I laid it in a little white linen cloth; though they wished that I should cast it into some unclean place. Afterwards, however, it was by a higher power taken away from my person. I could not comprehend why people of such wicked sort showed so much reverence and adored it: and no one could give me any satisfactory account of it. My questioning angered the evil spirits; they blasphemed the holy Host to the utmost, and I had to draw up a document for them in which I renounced that loose, vain Communion, together with the false god on the cross. I also cursed the sacrifice of the Mass, and vowed that whenever I saw the Host lifted up I would, with my eyes fixed upon it, spit in Christ's face, and blaspheme and revile him. In return I bound myself to worship their gods henceforth, and to observe all their ceremonies.

They put the writing, written with my blood, into my body; a third writing, to abide with them forever, they kept in their custody outside my body. Thus I was wholly and entirely separated from the Catholic Church, as if I had never been in it. Since it did not at all times suit that I should be able to remove the Host from my mouth at Communion, I agreed with them that they should all depart from me on that same day. For they could not endure the burden of the holy Host; it pressed upon them too strongly, and they held me on that very day to be unclean and unfit; but on the following day they tormented me all the harder for it. Whenever I wished to go to church, they made my limbs so heavy, as if I were dragging masses of iron behind me.

When I entered the order, I once more set up for them a new writing: in which I granted them full power over body and soul; I bestowed upon them both of my free possessions forever, and entrusted them wholly to their protection and shelter. Thus they had almost swallowed me up, and wholly transformed me into themselves; and I could do no good work any more, lived quite brutishly without any knowledge of God; yet they let me go on carelessly and without seriousness in performing what the order required. On the night before I took the customary monastic vows, they made me write a protestation: that my vow should be only a sham; instead of yielding my obedience to God and to my superiors, I gave it into their hands, to deal with it for their favor. I am, they said, not a nun at all, and would never be one in eternity; as proof of this I delivered to them the profession which I had made. Thus the longer I was with them, the more perverse I became. If sometimes good thoughts came to me, they tormented me with many godless things, and I had now to put my heart in writing to them as well; so that they might lay the writing upon what had been written, and govern it thereby according to their pleasure.

Now a cursed spirit came to me, who at first threatened me most severely, and demanded of me that I should grant him alone as much power over body and soul as all the others together had. He also brought three others with him, whom I was to permit to enter and depart my body at their pleasure; in return he promised to furnish me so richly with art and skill that I might confute everyone who came against me. I was rashly curious, and would gladly have learned the art which he almost loudly extolled to me. \[Page 118\]

I was also persuaded, and gave to the first of the three my memory, to the second my understanding, to the third my will; and they each carried them into me and placed them in their particular seat. Thus all my senses were bound, and I was transformed from a person into a devil. The loose knave then brought me another one, who was called the Enchanter; he had the shape of a Rübezahl, almost fair and pleasant to look upon. When I held this in my hands I saw and knew whatever I could desire. By means of it I also had knowledge of all evil and unjust doctrines and religions in every place and corner; I also saw and knew all their ceremonies and the falsely supposed worship of God that is practiced everywhere; of that one could write an unspeakable amount. To this I was moreover obliged: that, if every earlier obligation should become powerless, the one, strangely written in foreign and unknown characters, and as comprehensive as the others, should remain hidden and valid. After him followed another, called Freilehre; he gathered blasphemers, heathens and Saracens about him. He asked me why I still carried a piece of the Cross on me. I had to tear it from me with terrible railing and cursing; they made me trample it with my feet, and I had to renounce the crucified God who allowed himself to be hanged on it, and his blood, all the articles of the faith and the holy sacraments.

They set before me now meals of all sorts of foods, and I held myself the happiest person on earth; in this they greatly strengthened me, and I was entirely willing and ready. After some time they accused me that I had never asked any favor of them; I should desire to receive baptism in their fashion and manner, which I then did, so that I would become wholly and entirely their own. They then took off my garment, anointed all my limbs with a precious oil, as it seemed to me, together with other great pomp; then clothed me again in quite different garments, and I chanted with them their loose, doggish Mass and cursed devilish words. Since they also said they had no power to fasten me entirely in their service until I renounced all the graces I had received from the Church, I had to deny the sacrament of Confirmation. I was now also to receive Communion, in their fashion and manner, from their hands every month, and beforehand abstain for three days from every other food, except that which they gave me. They then took a morsel which had a very pleasant and sweet taste; with that they played much mockery and pomp. They did this upon a high elevated place, pronounced a blessing over it according to their opinion; then they gave it into my mouth, and that they called their Communion.

Against the Christian Communion they spoke blasphemous, scornful words; I had to throw the holy Host to the ground, and they spat upon it; yet I am quite certain I remember that I could never bring myself actually to hit it. They also let me take a piece of the holy Cross; I set it upon the top of a credenza, fastened the holy Host to it, and then said: if he were the right, true God, he must show it, and would not allow himself to be so miserably dressed and tormented! And I know well that I did all this with particular rage, scorn and hatred. I, wretch, held this pious God worse than the thieves who were crucified with him; for I could not once get into my head that a God should thus allow himself to be nailed to a cross. Therefore when I once saw a procession with the holy Sacrament pass by my room, and then saw the people with their many lights and great devotion and reverence, I wondered greatly how it came about that so many people would strive to accompany such a thing, which to me was so utterly repugnant, indeed an abomination. \[Page 119\]

And I began almost to laugh and to deride: Behold a wonder! how is it that the one whom the Christians worship is carried about by men; and moreover so mockingly and always in the shape of a naked man. Meanwhile they set up before me, by the one who called himself a sorcerer, all manner of panels and images, and they placed these their idols aloft with great reverence and diabolical singing; which, at that time, sounded very pleasing in my ears, and then I offered no canonical hour or prayer except what they put into my mouth.

When these their idols thus stood forth in their glory, they made me step up to the first tier; thereupon they raised a great clamor and shouting; and I pledged them my fidelity, and never to worship any other god than those to which they should point me. After such an oath they embraced me with great joy, praised and exalted me to the highest --- thinking they had never bound any creature so firmly to themselves as they had bound me. They also often gave me great feasts, and told me with what unspeakable joy they would lead me from this life into that life.

They were exceedingly angry at the images of the saints; and I had to suffer severely if I uttered my customary prayer, which they had taught me, in their presence. They otherwise held very rigidly and strictly to their statutes; I also had to confess my transgressions to one of them; thereupon I was punished without any mercy; and one after another came and inflicted some torment upon me. When a commanded fast-day occurred, they brought me meat and forced me to eat it; even unclean animals they thrust into my body when I acted against their command. All high feast-days, the Christians' times of joy, were fast-days for me; I had also to perform all sorts of practices contrary to Christian rites. If I had not observed one, then they made me so hungry that I became as if furious and raging about it, and yet everything I tried to enjoy I had to give up again, until they were satisfied with their sport.

In such heavy servitude I led my life; one after another who called himself a god I had to obey for a day or a week at a time. Yet one always remained with me who brought me every sort of delight, joy and diversion; and that pleased me well, and I was of good cheer. Another, who called himself the spirit of true freedom, likewise kept close to me; and for several years they contrived so that they would gladly have brought me out of the cloister, but they were not able to do so.

Now one came to me who gave me an image, wondrously prepared, and said: if this is to be the true god, to whom you shall sacrifice and serve, he shall be called Ninus. Such a proposal pleased me exceedingly, for he recounted to me in splendid words his power and authority in the world. Upon my assent he bade the others prepare the place for it. A whole host of them appeared, to whom I devoted my body, so that they might do with it altogether according to their desire and will. The wretched sorcerer-devil, whose services I had employed in this, now presented to me a palace by his specter. But to me it was nothing else but as if it were a glorious, wondrously beautiful temple; and in my eyes it seemed that no church could be compared to such temples. \[Page 120\]

In these temples I worshipped the idol which I myself had made by diabolical craft and instruction, and which thereafter was burned by the priests in the fire. Now one came to me who called himself the spirit of blood, saying: so that you might be altogether perfect and without blemish, you must not offer a dead but a living sacrifice from your own body. At this proposal I was appalled; I had never before seen this god of blood, as he called himself, and I rejected his demand.

Then he threatened me strongly: he would make me a shame before the whole world; and the cursed villains tormented me so miserably that I had to obey their will at any time. Then a devil came with a great retinue who called himself Beleal, and to whom I was to sacrifice the victim. They set him with great reverence upon a splendid throne and waited on him for service. The blood-devil placed me before him and demanded of me that I, of my good, free will, give him power and authority to enter into my body, and from the same freely and unhindered take out the victim. From three parts of my body a piece was to be cut from each, which could not be done without gruesome pains, but great grace and rich reward would follow; for this work would have greater force and effect than anything I had ever done. I would then become like God, and they would afterwards cause me to be worshipped in God's stead. To such high promises I yielded to their will.

They now laid me upon a table, upon which I first had to spread a white linen cloth in order to catch the blood; and now, with my miserable pains, a piece was cut out which I wrapped in the blood and brought as an offering to Beleal. The same game was played with me for the next two days. Ah, what a painful sacrifice that was --- pain upon pain! --- and I also had to put on an outward show before the people as if I were burdened with some other bodily infirmity!

Meanwhile many pious and Christian people often spoke to me worthily about the most holy Sacrament; I thought to myself: if I might see a sign of it, I would straightway worship it beside my other gods as well. That displeased the devils, and they punished me bitterly for it. They bade me take a host, of which I always had a supply; and I took it up to a place in the house. "Now we will, make and command thee," they said, "that thou now, in our presence, curse and deny it, and with drawn knife, out of spite and mockery, stab it through; then thou wilt see what little power it has, and how weaker it is than we." Then, with a hardened heart, I drew my knife and thrust it into the most worthy Sacrament. After that stab the blood immediately began to gush from it, and the chamber was filled with a bright radiance which surrounded the holy host; which then again was transported back to its place where the others were. Then I was very frightened, especially since all the bystanders at once fled away with frightful howling, tumult and trembling, and left me half dead behind. I then began to weep and to consider that I had truly been deceived and seduced by the devils; and when I reflected properly on the sign I at last fell quite into despair. \[Page 121\]

Then the devils came raging to me, saying: they had indeed hitherto certainly deceived and seduced me; I had pierced the true God, whom they themselves acknowledged thereby; the sin which I had committed could not be forgiven; nothing remained for me but to do as Judas did and hang myself. Since they now also threatened to take my life, I consented to be hanged by them. They bade me go up upon the roof of the house and put my leather belt about my own neck. I did so, and gave them full power to deal with me according to their pleasure. There were a great number of them who disputed over my soul; they hoisted me up to strangle me. But however they attempted it, it was impossible for them to draw the belt tight about my throat. They ascribed this to the protection of a sodomitical wretch --- the so‑called St. Mary Magdalene --- who defended me; and said I ought to yield myself to the loose harlot.

I said it in plain words, for it seemed to me I was already half dead. But however cruelly they tormented me, and thrust into my belly, they nevertheless never were able to kill me. The murder-devil then said to me: I should thrust the knife into my throat; thereby I would inflict on myself the due punishment. But it was not possible for me to accomplish such a thing; for I could not bring my arm to my neck, however firmly a whole swarm helped me thereto. The girdle I had to give them, and they afterwards always kept it with them.

I then returned downstairs, tired, weak, shattered, and half broken; was exceedingly sad, and ceaselessly what I had seen lay upon my mind; and I had to lie down to recover. They sent for the physician, and gave me medicines; but by bodily means I could not be helped. From that time forward it lay constantly on my mind that I would gladly have sought the opportunity to learn the truth concerning the venerable Sacrament. But because I was not myself, and could not use any of my limbs according to my will, they hindered me whenever I came before a priest; and caused that I straightway spoke the opposite, and set forth all manner of subtle, captious things.

From that time on, whenever I went to the holy Sacrament, a trembling and a shudder assailed me: and it was finally perceived that I did not lead the life that a believing Christian and a person of the Order ought to live. Then counsel was taken in the convent to keep me confined in a separate room, and to consider counsel and means to reconcile me again with God. Yet at that time they could have no knowledge of all that had befallen me; and I led the most miserable life, desiring only to drown myself or to kill myself, if I could have found the opportunity. The nuns of the convent who saw me in that evil state had pity on me, comforted me, and spoke kindly to me. My words in return were so exceedingly awkward, rough and unfriendly, that they appeared unpleasant to them; therefore they had to leave me in my condition. \[Page 122\]

My lord, the Archbishop, came to our convent, and I wished to take refuge with him; but they so blinded my face that he appeared to me very stern and terrifying. They also once showed me the abyss of Hell, together with the punishment that I would have to suffer for each of my sins; I saw in a deep pit nothing but fire, darkness, intolerable stench, hellish dragons and serpents, one of which I must swallow, because I had received Communion on Holy Maundy Thursday. They have done all this to me out of their great malice, and all this is not fancy or imagination, but truly happened thus; for I know and confess that I committed the sins written above with my own body and my limbs, as I have told.

But the power and mercy of God, who never abandons his creatures in their distress, did not regard that I had gone far from him; rather he caused me to seek and run after help, and sent me Saint Mary Magdalene, who did not forsake me in all my greatest anguishes. To her praise and honor I have related what sort of life I led at the instigation of the devil; so that it may be made known to all the world what grace and help I obtained from this my intercessor and protector. As witnesses of this I take my God and Lord, the pious Lady and all the heavenly host; on earth, however, the Most Reverend Prince in God and Lord Archbishop of Cambrai, and all his priestly coadjutors; then all my fellow-sisters who have seen me.

Thus far the unfortunate woman's own handwritten report; but what occurred during the two years she was under spiritual treatment outwardly seemed to confirm completely what she afterwards reported about the state of her inner life. In her delusion she had at first made a prostration before the archbishop and begged his blessing. There her patron saint had appeared to her in great splendor, and to her terror, and to the consternation of her spirits, had received the blessing in her name. They then pronounced the exorcism over her, and compelled one of these spirits of hers to speak; and he confessed in all their names that they would be forced to depart by the merit of these saints.

When it was soon noticed that the patient was utterly and entirely without faith, priests were appointed to her by the archbishop to instruct her in the knowledge of God. She, however, showed herself stubborn and contentious and disputed every point; and the archbishop had to have her sign the Creed with her own hand in order to move her to grant him some belief. She was then instructed in her conventual duties; the original of her profession document, which had been lost, had to be procured again, and she was required to make her profession a second time.

They led her then through all the churches and to all the relics of the diocese, and bathed her in holy water, through whose power and effect all manner of base and abominable things then issued from her: tufts of hair and many little creatures, like smoky worms, came from her --- all of which caused a very great stench. To curb her malice and to weary the enemies, she was put into a dark and narrow prison. But as the evil only grew, she was brought back into the sick-room, and Sister Barbara Deruillers was assigned to her as keeper. There the evil spirits tormented her severely again, so that she often screamed for three hours at a stretch. In the presence of her keeper she was hurled from the bed into the room, and with head, arm, or the whole body so fiercely thrown against the floor that one saw the marks everywhere. \[Page 123\]

She could often eat nothing for three days, and then they filled her mouth with poisonous vermin. Once she was dragged to the brook that runs just behind the convent and thrust under the water. The keeper cried for help, and they could not drown her; the fellow sisters pulled her out alive. Another time she was cast from her chamber out of the window onto the courtyard; again she was led to the highest rooms of the house in order to hurl her down from there as well. To guard against this, they resolved to bind her with strong straps and ropes to a stout wooden chair and to lay her arms crosswise in a stock; but all in vain. She slipped her body, arm and leg nimbly out of the bonds without any knot having been loosened or any wood having been displaced from its place; and then at midnight she was led to a part of the convent that is very narrow and to which few people ever come, where, after long searching, she was finally found.

Then for a time she was made foolish so that she knew no one, and constantly said: "I will die, I!" and therefore would neither eat nor drink. Then she fell utterly silent and wept without cessation; at last she could neither sit nor lie down, but went like a madwoman pacing up and down the chamber. When a fast-day came, she could not take any food on the previous day; then on the day itself such a dreadful hunger came upon her that she would have eaten her own flesh. Thereupon, again in the presence of the priests, raw carrion was brought to her; and they filled her mouth with fetid blood and rotten flesh so that no one could endure being near her.

Now, following an apparition of her patron saint, a kind of wall was built around her in her chamber; which prevented the spirits from coming to her past the middle of the room. Soon, in confession, they learned from her the pledges she had made to them, and these were wrung from her by the exorcism. Fourteen consecrated hosts, which she had gradually put aside, were returned; and among them was one with a bloody mark where the stab had gone through. A piece of the cross also had to be fetched again.

She finally relapsed once more, and pledged anew to her spirits that she would never abandon them; but soon after, by a new apparition of her patron saint, she was again brought back to the right way. Now the images of silver and of bell‑metal to which she had sacrificed were surrendered. When they immediately learned also what had been done with the cutting out of a piece of flesh from her body, the spirits were compelled to speak about it. At first they denied it, then said that the injury of the wounded would be mortal if they left her. But when the exorcism continued, the three pieces, wrapped in the cloth, were placed at the spot assigned to them. She was then tormented the whole night with unheard‑of pains, until at last in the morning they left her. \[Page 124\]

She remained free for three weeks or longer, during which, in the last nights, much blood and putrid flesh came from her. An almost strange condition in several places of her body then continued for another year and 23 weeks, with much pain. Her evil spirits were now by the exorcism gradually entirely separated from her. Only one, who had been the first and had then taken the father's place with her, would absolutely not depart. He told her that whatever she had hitherto said and done had all happened through him; if he therefore left her, she would come to notable shame, because she, who had all along been counted a reasonable, sharp‑witted person, would then no longer be able to speak a single word of her own.

This moved her heart and distressed her so much that she threw herself at the feet of her exorcist, begging him to let her at least keep that one. When he refused, she cried amid many tears: "O what a bitter parting that is!" Only when he promised her that he would be her father in the place of the one expelled---whom she afterward additionally set beside the archbishop as grandfather---did she permit that he too be expelled.

Now the liberated woman had become truly natural, purely innocent, childlike in simplicity; she had become entirely ignorant, without any knowledge of God or of creatures; she could not utter any other words than: "Pater! Haus! and beautiful Maria!" With the image of the latter that was handed to her she played like a child with its doll, and spoke to it. They therefore had to take her again like a child into instruction, and first teach her to make the sign of the cross. By the archbishop's blessing her tongue had to be unloosed again to restore to her the use of speech. The same had to be done to all her limbs so that she might be able to walk properly again.

A whole year was still appointed to her as a year of penance, during which she, being exposed to outward attacks of her spirits, had to suffer severe torment. Meanwhile she was taught again to read and to pray. At a comforting apparition of her patron saint, on the anniversary of the former one, her mind became keener; and she then received instruction, in part from the archbishop himself, in the catechism of Father Canisius, not without much wrangling and resistance on her part. For occasional relapses still occurred from time to time; in one of these she rushed so furiously with fists and feet at the archbishop that he had scarcely enough to do to save his life from her.

When she came in the catechism to the doctrine of the Eucharist, she absolutely would not give credence to the truth of it; and it required a private vision to remove all her doubts. For four months she was then taught the choir-singing, which she mastered completely. Meanwhile her bodily injuries, arising from the suffering, had in silence again become so serious that they were obliged to summon the physician Cospeau and some women knowledgeable in female conditions to see whether they could not procure her some relief. The counsel which these, together with the physician, held amounted to this: the injury is mortal; the prescribed medicines, however, only caused her further torments; and it came to pass that within a few hours her death was expected. But after first many pieces of rotting flesh had come away, she was restored to her former state. After several times more demoniac ecstasies alternated with others of a higher kind, at last the crisis drew near. \[Page 125\]

She gathered all the clergy about her who had hitherto stood by her; they likewise summoned her convent-sisters so that all might be present with their prayers; and in the afternoon, at three o'clock, the struggle began in the presence of her patron saints. She faltered and trembled, and behaved as one in the last agonies; she spoke from time to time with her tormentors and answered their words. At times she cried out: They tear me apart, they tear me apart! Then she was again plunged into the utmost fear and pain. Thereupon she suddenly cried: Ah, how will it fare with me yet, I can no longer endure it!

They comforted her and strengthened her with prayers. Finally there came a tugging at the ceiling and a delirium like that of a dying person. When she was asked what she was beginning, she answered: She herself then lay down upon her pillow and lay there as in wide stillness, and the struggle was decided. The parts of her body which had been cut away and thereby separated and set apart were again joined together in their natural places, and all her pains ceased. Those present sang "Herr Gott, dich loben wir" (Lord God, we praise thee)! She displayed many wounds which she had received in the struggle, and showed the shirt that was full of blood; then prayed her hours and went with the sisters into the refectory to supper.

On 6 January 1586 she had yet one last convulsion, in which Mary Magdalene appeared to her, and she was wholly and forever freed. The course of events was then written down; that and the sister's writing were read before the apostolic and royal notary Godfried von Liere; in the presence of the archbishop, Dr. Fr. Buisseret, the official, the canon Goubille, Dean Hollo, Mansent, the canon of St. Germain, Banay, canon of Andemie, the confessor of the convent, the sister Deruillers, former attendant of Johanna, the present abbess, the liberated woman herself, the physician Cospeau, one of the midwives, and finally some of the old convent-women; all of whom, so far as concerned them, confirmed the truth of what had been read as eyewitnesses; whereupon the summoned notary, with his own signature, on 6 and 7 February 1586 ratified the instrument. \[Page 126\]

Thus the external authenticity in this truly wondrous story is well secured; but how shall it stand as regards the inner authenticity? One will immediately reply: a religious monomania in the best form! But if such a method is madness, then there remains no mark by which its train of thought could be distinguished from that in the most regular exercise of reason; and folly would be only a variety of reason. Well, one will go on to say: so then it is the deceitful, phantastic fabrications of a warped imagination; outwardly supported by the arts of a crafty natural, practised against superstitious and guileless, and therefore unwary people. Such a supposition, in that it, in order to avoid an objective Hell, transfers its flames into the person, robs that person of the only thing which excuses the first fall of sin in man, and yet leaves him open to salvation --- namely, that he fell through the seduction of an already existing evil. Thus, in destroying the moral nature of the one and abandoning her hopelessly to perdition, it must equally utterly negate the sound common sense of all who surround this one person --- here the whole convent, all the clergy, physicians and midwives. For two years these have allowed themselves to be fooled by her without once coming upon the suspicion of fraud; a suspicion which otherwise, as a rule, is the first thing a man is led to in such cases, and which in fact was not wanting among some individuals in this instance. And such depravity, not only in sin but also in amendment, would, with such stupidity, have had to coincide in all the countless cases in which one has seen and experienced the like; so that Nature would already have allotted in advance to every villain his number of good‑natured victims. \[Page 127\]

One must therefore, to escape these improbabilities and contradictions, descend one step lower; into those regions of the naturally unconscious life where such riddles at least find a necessary explanation; without, however, being obliged to exclude altogether the occasional imposture and deception which lie entirely on the same line with the chiefly active agent. We therefore see in all these occurrences a repetition of that act in which the first woman fell. As there the seductive evil objectified itself to her as a serpent, so here it appears in the shape of that handsome young companion of the younger daughter, and the curse has formed the first bond which links her to him. He offers her an apple, fair to behold, and wheat‑bread, good to eat; he will be her father, she is to cling to him as a child.

She is thus already clairvoyant at that age; but this condition of hers, instead of, as with the mystical saints, rising toward the glorified, is in her reversed into the infernal; and while in those the objects of the heights are mirrored in the camera clara, in her the objects of the depths, lighted by her flames, are depicted in the camera obscura. Having become accountable at her twelfth year, the grown woman binds herself to live according to his will: an act comparable to the betrothal of the saints with the Redeemer; only that in theirs bitterness and the thorn of suffering go before and sweetness follows; here the latter go before, to yield afterwards to the former. The state of former unawareness is now over, her eyes are opened; she has attained the knowledge of good and evil. The Good stands before her as the Church, from which she now freely has renounced; and she is filled with dread of it, and seeks to avoid and flee it. In that she, in equally free consent, having eaten with the seed of the dragon the bitter‑orange (Pomeranzapfel), his church stands objectively before her; she feels an inward pull and sympathy toward it; for every evil disposition within her has now awakened to its peculiar demon, and he stands before her visibly as her seducer, and she on her part yields to the seduction. The first of these seductions is directed to increase the hostility between her and the forsaken Church, so that the friendship with the newly chosen may be strengthened.

Before the sacrament of confession she must bind her tongue to lying; the sacrament of the altar is made loathsome to her by cramps in the throat, every church attendance by the heaviness in her limbs. At Mass she must spit in the face of the Crucified. On entering the order she must surrender her obedience to the demons, and sign over her heart to them, so that they may obtain power over body and soul; thus that henceforth she is a nun in the fellowship of the abyss. As a sign that she has thereby entered into perfect obedience, she must finally also pledge will, intellect and memory, and give herself wholly up to her superiors, as the magnetised do to the magnetiser.

The order of the abyss is, however, the order of sorcery; the sorcerous devil therefore now makes himself objectively present to the new convent-sister, and she receives, as her wage, the art of evil magic, symbolised by an instrument. But since the false skill rests upon erroneous knowledge, another demon, that of error or heresy, has joined this demon; and the eyes of the fallen are now opened, and she is in possession of all evil and false wisdom on earth. \[Page 128\]

To advance further she must now be initiated still deeper into the mysteries of the abyss, and all its sacraments are to be bestowed upon her. In its Eucharist she has now admitted the demon into herself, and she must venerate him as her god. From the various spirits and powers which are of its essence they now, with the help of that magical instrument, make tablets and images, some cast in silver, others of bell‑metal; probably ancient idols which were found in the earth in their neighbourhood --- the land of the old Nervii --- and which they have contrived to procure for themselves. She must now worship before them, celebrate their service festively, and, as a temple‑slave, submit to all the pressure of servility; for the demon of so‑called true freedom has likewise entered her. All the abominations of the old idolatry must now reappear around her; Ninus is therefore, characteristically enough, the demon who now presents himself to her; and his image is set up in a rich idol‑temple, the building of which stands each time before her in ecstasy. She is to become like one of the Elohim, and to obtain adoration as a goddess; but for that she must first sacrifice a portion of her own. The blood‑devil is especially busy in this, for the blood‑scenes of the old Indian Shiva‑worship are to be renewed; just as the servants of Kali sacrificed the limbs of their bodies on their altars in order to regain them tenfold, so shall it be now. From the most secret parts of her body she shall bring three pieces of flesh as an offering to those idols. Something similar to what the priests of Attis and Cybele did is now repeated; for the altars of the Baal‑priests are again re‑erected.

But the utmost abyssal immersion has not yet been reached; the submerged one must cause the holiest thing, from which she has renounced, to undergo the same that she herself has consented to. Now she stands at the goal, but now the catastrophe also occurs. The horror at the abomination --- doubtless again enacted in vision --- forces from the companion the confession of the practiced deceit; she, however, is seized by despair, because the curse of death is about to be fulfilled upon her. But as ecstatics do not burn in fire, so they are not strangled by the rope; the rigid hands cannot bring the knife to the throat. In the analogous case this succeeded only for Christina of Stommeln, when she likewise attempted to defend herself in the vision of violent assault. Now, however, with the crisis the reversal approaches. \[Page 129\]

A higher guardian watched over her in the dangerous hour; the vision of Hell finally makes the fallen woman collapse within herself; she looks about for her redemption, and the Church comes to her aid, in the authority of the Redeemer. Immediately the work of her restoration begins, and proceeds, only in the reverse direction, along the same series of stages which the work of her corruption had taken before. When Evil had become an object to her, she herself had been subjectively wholly transformed by it. The return must begin with the undoing of this transformation; the organic reaction, on the other hand, makes itself known in convulsions, in flinging about, in being carried away, in wrenching herself free from all applied bonds, in ravenous hunger, in the taste or smell of carrion in her mouth. Within the space of a year, by the exorcism, the evil spirits --- previously shut off from her as if by a wall --- are finally separated from her, and sink back, in the same order in which they had become objective to her, into their unconsciousness. Her ceded faculties are restored to her, and at the same time the organs which had previously been bound are loosened, and she regains authority over those freed. When the spirit among the spirits, he who was first among the others, who had occupied the father-place with her, must likewise give way, then she sinks back into the mental condition of a four‑year‑old child: for her whole development had been the work of the spirits; now that these have left her, the whole structure falls to pieces. She must now rebuild herself anew from the ground up; the bonds that are to connect her with the Church gradually wind themselves about her; and her bodily wounds heal slowly, in proportion as she drinks from the healing fountain. Amid alternating demonic and higher ecstasies the final struggle at last breaks upon her, under whose throes her complete rebirth into the Church is finally accomplished.

But if in this case it has so happened --- if a secluded nun, in the solitude of her cell, has been able to make for herself such an access to the abyss that, as in that ladder to heaven of the old patriarch the spirits of the heights descended to him, so here the powers of the nether realm, climbing up to her on the ladders of the pits, converse with her in all that is loathsome --- then the question arises: Has such a relation not also seized whole masses, and in like manner connected them with the depths of the world? Has there not existed a species of such natures which, like the rhabdomancers with the metals and minerals that sleep in the womb of the earth, stand in a bond with them and feel them through all surrounding masses; and, penetrating still more deeply, also feel the spirit‑kingdom of the night, which hides behind these natural forms in the veiled interior of the earth, and set themselves into rapport with it? If such is really the case, and an entire series of facts speaks for the reality of such a relation, will not the whole of witchcraft and sorcery rest upon this foundation? \[Page 130\]

If what here in the concrete case befell a single personality --- if, that is, it spreads en masse over an entire order of natures inclined in this direction --- will that not fully interpret and explain all the oddities of these facts; and will it not light a lamp which illuminates the steps of the mind in these dark regions, so that it, without losing itself in the byways of their labyrinthine paths, attains an overview of the bewildering relations? It is indeed really so with this matter, and witchcraft truly rests upon this basis, and is only the extended image of that which we have here seen in full and most concentrated form. Heathenism, in its boundless degeneration, has led across into these regions; and the stages of the path it traversed are the same that are marked in the life of this nun. Then Christianity entered the world, took the fallen into its care, and led them back in the same sequence of steps by which this lost woman also attained restoration. The restoring Church, however, could not prevent the relapse of those who, abusing their freedom, preferred the downward-leading ways; the nun was one of that kind, and she belonged to an entire people settled in the regions of magic.

To demonstrate the firm grounding of this account in the mass of available facts, we must above all examine these more closely, and see whether they contradict one another and the supposition, or whether they, obedient to it, coalesce into a picture which, in its essential features, reproduces what has been stated clearly and as a model.

In doing so we shall again proceed according to the interrelation of the regions; assembling the material at hand according to the same type that in the higher orders also unites the individual into a whole. The mass-like, popular element will first occupy our attention, and we will not allow ourselves to be misled in our understanding by what is coarse and crude. For the people apprehend impressions in a popular way; just as their wit has taken the form of the Eulenspiegel, so the demonic will also present itself to them in the most massive forms, and their imagination will, in its manner, grasp sharply and help fashion the things. The facts will mostly furnish us with those judicial persons who were active in the witch-trials; chiefly in France, where those proceedings were still conducted with some deliberation and a certain form. De Lancre, in his book on the disorder in the Basque country, will here supply the richest store of such experiences; Nicolaus Rémy, in his book Daemonolatria libri tres (Frankf.), who conducted about eight hundred such trials in Lorraine, will next be added to these; and to them will then join the English and Scottish records and the German acts, and Bodin with his Demonomanie. Scattered items from the higher estates may then of themselves be found in their proper place.

### Chapter 1. Special Conditions of Organic Life in Witchcraft and Magic

\[Page 131\]

Just as food serves as the means for natural life, so the witch‑salve and the magic potion serve as a stimulant to one unnaturally excited in the realm of magic. On the natural side of these stimulants natural magic has already spoken; and we have there seen that they are chiefly plants with milky juices, and such as are commonly lumped together under the general name of narcotics, which are generally applied to this use. Just as the higher region in man, which rises above the middle, stands in closer intercourse with the higher region of the world, the heavens, and from there all that is unity and onefold comes to this middle; so the lower, pressed down beneath the middle, is in reciprocal relation with the lower region of the world; and since this is multiplicity and variety, everything divided, ascending from there above itself, comes into the middle and toward the height. This lowest region, however, now rests in its depth on the plant-like substratum of that realm, and, in like manner, another plant-like nature lies over it and follows it in its solar elevation and in its depression toward the arctic and antarctic --- its aerial nature toward the heights and its watery nature in the lowlands, in every angle of inclination of its position with respect to the incoming light, and in every relation to the sun's situation in the season; by this variety the greatest diversity of productions in this domain is conditioned.

The realm of plants, however, is a realm ruled by sleep, which fetters all its members to their sleeping-place, the earth. Yet it is not the iron stone-sleep that holds nature beneath it almost motionless; autonomous movement of the juices stirs within it, and above the bound half another (half) rises toward the light. Therefore, although nocturnal darkness deepens this plant-sleep into rootedness, the sun by day lights and illumines it at the greenness of the leaves, and the blossom will appear like a dream of this half‑sleep; and in its surroundings a kind of somnambulism is aroused, especially in sunshine; just as in this state in the sensitives a rudiment of higher movement appears.

In the plastic (formative) realm all these states also will be embodied, each in its own product; and with respect to the higher, animal life these products, sometimes serving as food, sometimes as excitants, bear in themselves the signature of half‑sleep or double‑sleep. For, as has been said, an analogous plant-like substratum forms the foundation on which this life rests; and through its mediation the external must enter into the supervening. According to the diversity of the natural condition from which the incoming thing has arisen, it will, being taken up into the interior in diverse ways, introduce an analogue of that condition into it; and whereas one product may therefore act only as soporific, another will break the sleep of life also into a half‑sleep.

Just as the vegetable substances are innumerable, so too are the functions and organs of life a great wealth, and each substance exerts a specific influence on the organ toward which it is directed; so it will be likewise that, as there are cardiacs, aphrodisiacs, etc., so there will also be magnetics which, directing their action toward the ganglia, impart into them that disposition which is required for this state. The life that subjects itself to their action is by them raised above itself in a natural way; and the matter can now, like any other natural condition, be viewed as an unusual modality of life. Or it can enter into the ethical life, and since Christianity scorns this natural augmentation whereas the demonic certainly includes it in its calculation, such choice will therefore always incline to that side. The natural remedy in such cases then becomes a magic potion and a witch's salve. \[Page 132\]

He in whom the impulse is strong by nature will require no aphrodisiac; and if one, perhaps in early youth, were to awaken the sleeper with it, then, once awakened, he would soon make the awakening agent superfluous. Likewise it will be with the means that introduce one into the witch‑sleep. If a disposition to put oneself into the sleep‑waking state of its own accord is present by nature, then the ointment will not be needed. If that disposition is lacking because the exterior so plastically envelopes the interior, then nevertheless, with continued use of this ointment, and with the more frequent recurrence of the separation of the two from one another, likewise the use of the natural stimulus will soon become unnecessary. Therefore there seems to lie between the state in which the individual still needs the ointment and that in which he is beyond that necessity a middle state, in which more depends on the magical preparation than on the ingredients themselves.

De Lancre says on this point: in Labourd one has consistently been of the belief that the ointment is prepared with the fat of children murdered before receiving baptism; and it has therefore been customary that novices in the witchcraft are allowed to have the prepared ointment shared with them by others; but that the further advanced must prepare it themselves, in order thereby to drive them to child‑murder. With still further advancement of the initiated, the ointment then finally became altogether needless.

The fiend Necato of Urrugne, the same reporter relates, as a prisoner went every night to the Sabbath; and I can assure you that she had neither grease nor ointment, nor the possibility of procuring any. For she sat confined alone in the chamber of an honest house; with her were 20--25 witnesses, who almost all likewise went to the Sabbath and slept in two other rooms of the same house. Three witnesses testified that they had been with her on the Sabbath at Lacua, on the coast of Hendaye, on the penultimate and the last July, 1600. They were answered that they were prisoners, and that therefore their statement must necessarily be an error; for they themselves had been in confinement on those nights and had had no ointment. We therefore confronted the witnesses and the accused with one another.

A girl called Gastagnalde testified against Necato that Necato ordinarily brought her to the Sabbath herself, and that on that night she too had been carried through the air to that place, where Necato stood by her as godmother and struck her very hard. The accused at length admitted the charge as founded; the complainant had received the blows because she herself had struck a toad that had been handed to her to keep. Cristoval of Garalde, aged 15--16 years, added that, as a reward for having revealed everything the day before, he had, although like the other witnesses previously confined, been led by the fiend Marissans of Tartas to the Sabbath. She had swung him so high into the air that he did not recognize the place of the Sabbath. There he was cruelly mistreated, and he had also seen Necato strike that Gastagnalde; to which he added certain particulars. \[Page 133\]

The third, Aspileuetta, added that she, together with the previous witness, had been brought there by one who formerly used to lead her to the Sabbath, and had witnessed the same; which Necato in fact confessed anew upon repeated accusation. She further asserted that she had been brought one night toward Hendaye, where a small Sabbath was held. There also appeared Detsail, whom the judges already knew from other statements, that he there habitually carried the basin into which every attendee placed his offering or his penance; and he too sat then, in accordance with one of their dispositions, likewise in prison.

The Necato had accused him, and he therefore struck her hard in the assembly. At that time Monsieur Laurent de Moisset, advocate at the Parliament of Bordeaux, who sat with the rest of us in Bayonne to try these women, happened to be in Hendaye. There two women came to him who reported: Detsail, although in prison, had been at the assembly on the previous night, and there had struck the Necato with the utmost severity. Two girls from Hendaye, not far off, living near the place where the Sabbath had been held, had recognized her by her voice. They wished to be doubly sure of the matter, and had the Necato brought forward. She repeated the confession she had previously made. They also had Detsail brought forward, and she stood by her statement before him; at the same time averring that she had always seen him with the sacrificial bowl.

1)  In the first case one might suspect an agreement among the witnesses, since they had been confined together; but the voluntary confession of the accused contradicts that suspicion. What remained of suspicion is again diminished by the cross‑test. The striker of before is now herself the struck one; and that she did not speak untruth is corroborated by the testimony of the two women, from the remote place, the scene of the whole transaction.

Whatever therefore underlay it, it could not have been mere frenzy or malice; there must have been a condition present in all these people in which they all stood in an inward rapport; from which they then drew the truth and the concurrence that appeared in their statements. This condition was not here produced by the artificial means of anointing, since they all could not resort to the same; it must therefore have been habitual in them, and that is what we wished here to establish. This condition, whether brought about artificially or naturally, now begins with a sleep, to which there always follows an awakening; so that it is a lucid sleep that befalls those seized.

We asked, reports de Lancre, especially Maria Dindart of Sare, whether one could go to the Sabbath while awake. She replied: the truth is that one never goes to the Sabbath awake; one had slept beforehand; which is why one also goes to the churches, to keep watch there through the nights, and so prevent the departure. But it is perfectly sufficient to have only one eye lightly closed, and in the instant one is borne there. For it requires only the span of a nod of the eye, and however distant the place may be, whether it lie in the Terra Nova or at the end of the world, the sleeper finds himself transported thither.

Their statements, however, indicated that upon the preceding state of sleep another state of wakefulness follows; and that the rapture or transport then takes place in a perfectly waking condition, and not as an illusion, but entirely and wholly real. The women therefore, who, as we have already stated, sat spinning in the streets on summer nights until eleven o'clock in the evening, each named to herself the coming Sabbath; apparently wished one another a good night, then went to bed, and rose later to be borne to the Sabbath --- each in her own fashion, or several together in a group or individually, gathered together to set out. \[Page 134\]

They told me at the same time: the lady of Chantocorena was on the night of the 28th... Sept. 1609 had been at the Sabbath; but she positively denied this, because she had kept herself awake the whole night. This, in fact, was the practice of all our prisoners: they all made every imaginable effort to remain awake, in order to convince us that they had not been carried off, because they were all of the belief that one cannot be abducted with waking senses. Therefore the children flocked to the churches to pass the nights there sleepless. One sees that so long as the will succeeded in overcoming nature and forcing back sleep, the inward awakening required for the disclosure of the whole condition could not appear. But if the bound person succeeded in freeing himself even for a moment, he would suddenly swing inward, and the individual was, in an instant, transported to the place of his desire. The clearness of the outlook in this inward-going will naturally depend on the circumstances and on the disposition of the individual on these paths. The demonic realms are by no means places in which clarity prevails, and aerial perspective has no validity there; yet the cloudiness will nevertheless be graduated step by step. In beginners it will appear more disturbed and confused by the natural illumination, and only in progress, as the inner eye becomes more accustomed to the darkness, will it loosen and distribute itself more to the gaze.

A remarkable statement to this effect is that of Johanna Michaelis before Remigius. She was examined in the year 1500 and said: that those who were at the Sabbath by no means had their true, natural sight; but that everything appeared as if it were in confusion, so that one could see nothing certain or sure about it. "It is exactly so," she added, "as when one finds the eyes dulled by drunkenness or sleep, or also by fear, or sees badly for any other reason, or is otherwise blinded by jugglery." Dark notions of various degrees of depth of entanglement in that state already occur. Thus de Lanere relates from his interrogations: if the women wished to go to the Sabbath only in image and contemplation, they lay themselves down on the left side. If they then awoke, the demon caused them to emit a thick vapor from the mouth, in which they then perceived everything that occurred at the Sabbath, as if they saw it in a mirror. But if they wished to be bodily present there, they anointed themselves with an ointment of child's fat.

Others said again: artificial ecstasies, like those which the Indians produce by the herb cohoba, showed them the visions repeatedly. Then the spirit led the thus-initiate physically to the place; but even there it sometimes left them in doubt whether what had been shown to those led had happened in truth or by illusion. Thus three states, arranged one after another in gradual progression. The mere vision, brought about by a reflection, in a dark cloud that rises before the now clairvoyant inner eye. The deception in this image then approaches the truth by presenting itself as a reality; yet so that a doubt as to its reality remains in the seer. The image then, at a third stage, finally shapes itself so plastically and tangibly that the doubt disappears, and the beholder gains conviction of the reality of what is seen; because no means remain to demonstrate an error in it. Moreover, of physiological interest is also the testimony that a husband gave to Judge Remy: his wife, on the night before Friday, whenever she had gone to bed, would each time be ice-cold. \[Page 135\]

In man, double-natured as he is --- an outer nature that encloses an inner, and moreover both divided into an upper and a lower --- there lie four different states beside, in, and above one another. Two of these are states of sleep, in which the lower predominates; two are waking states, in which the higher is predominant. Of those two sleeps, one is ordinary sleep, in which the life that predominates below, being closed inward, has an impulse, according to ordered intervals, to issue outward again from its withdrawal. The other is what may be called the magnetic sleep, which precedes the sleep‑waking, in which sleep the life, closed toward the outside, has the impulse in itself to enter inward, in a determinate sequence, into the spiritual regions.

About and above these two states stand the two awakenings, such that one outwardly encompasses the first sleep‑state, the other inwardly encompasses the other sleep‑state; and the encompassed appear as the veiled germs out of which the encompassing develop. Thus natural sleep will pass over into the ordinary waking state, where the higher powers, like the life that they discharge, spread themselves into the external world. Magnetic sleep will in turn pass into somnambulistic awakening, where those same higher powers, together with the life from which they disentangled themselves and which they now in their turn control, sink more deeply into the inner world. \[Page 136\]

Both worlds are objective, both are equally real: one, in its outermost, embracing the world of substances governed by necessity; the other concerning the causalities that determine themselves in freedom. To which side any individuality inclines depends on its constitution, the circumstances, and the predominant life‑impulse in it --- whether this impulse that begins in sleep directs the life predominantly toward the external world, or whether that sleep, originally or accidentally determined to be magnetic, awakens into the inner world. The same relation that here forms itself toward the two natural regions can likewise form itself toward God. Man can fall asleep in that twofold sleep of the world, in its outer or inner region, and awakened from this double sleep into God, can now, either by the outward way of the Church or by the inward mystical way as the saints pursued, raise himself to Him. But God is now the most real Being, for he is the Creator of all that attains reality, and therefore he himself must be that. This awakening in God must therefore be a wholly real condition, and the world of actions and facts that then opens to him must appear as a world of reality pure and simple; whatever unreality mixes into this condition can only arise from the imperfection of the individual who is in it. The descent from this condition into the ordinary world of appearances, however, can by comparison be regarded as a falsification of that original, solely true reality through the admixture of semblance; for he who sees things in God recognizes them only in their truth; he who perceives them in the mirror of the world recognizes them only as they give themselves in the reflector. Here, too, it will be constitution, impulse, choice and direction that decide for the individual to which side he turns; whether he will hold to the radical truth in itself, or only to it in the husk of appearance. What therefore holds upward in relation to God will also have its validity downward toward the abyss; and the world and Satan will here form the opposites. Here, likewise, sleeping and awakening may be directed toward one or the other of these opposites. Man can, namely, awaken from the sleep of life into the outward Church of Satan which has built itself on all vices and crimes on earth; and then feel himself, in the fellowship of this bond, as a member of that association. Or, if he awakens inwardly, he can penetrate into the interior of that realm, and deepen himself down to its concrete head. But if God is the most real Being, then Satan will be the most unreal. For all reality that is in him he has from God, namely the reality of his being; everything else he has from himself: a reality only of third order, because it rests as a mere accidental upon the substantial ground of this gifted existence. The reality of the state of immersion in him, and of acting in his power, is therefore likewise only a reality of third or fourth order; and while natural immersion can be clouded by error and mistake,

it will be this satanic one that is falsified by lies and confused by striving toward an evil end. There is therefore indeed a truth and a law in this condition; but it is only the general lawfulness of Being which keeps every deviation within certain bounds. Those who are in it have looked into the magic mirror; and to the semblance that has already flown toward every truth in the world-mirror there has now been added the deliberate perversity that proceeds from lying, and in it the image has finally become distorted. This, then, is somnambulism in the magical realm---true insofar as no empty phantasy lies at its foundation; untrue insofar as it is the negative realm of malice and of falsehood in which it has taken up its dwelling as its region. Again here the impulse in the constitution and the ordering of life-circumstances have been decisive, and have given the individual the direction into the sphere of that self-blinding mode of being.

#### A. The Mark of the Lords and Their Men

\[Page 137\]

But once the impulse has decided and the lots have fallen that the way downward is to be taken, then upon entrance into those realms a kind of manifest notification must proclaim to their inhabitants the resolved determination. Everyone has the right to designate all factual property that belongs to him---his whole inheritance, real and movable goods---with his name, mark or seal; the powers of darkness will claim the same right. \[Page 138\]

They can, however, exercise it only upon such persons who, by giving themselves into the slavery of Evil of their own free will and with premeditation, abase themselves to the affair, and having thus sold themselves into serfdom, are justly counted among the remaining estate of possession and, like the slaves of the Romans, are marked with the signet of their lord. As is therefore said in the Apocalypse, that the followers of the Beast are bound to bear a mark on the forehead or on the hand, and that no one may trade, buy or sell without it --- so in those regions where the Apocalypse is thus being realized in the hidden darkness, it is already done to newcomers at the very entrance to their gates. All are marked, in order to distinguish them from those who do not belong to the fellowship; and this mark can be covered, but not removed without higher assistance than they possess.

The mark, however, consists in small spots on the surface of the body, never larger than a pea, which are insensible, without life and blood, while all around them they find themselves surrounded on every side by living flesh. They are sometimes recognizable by a red or black spot, or by a depression of the flesh, but sometimes also externally indistinguishable; and then only by knowledge of the place where they are usually set, or by an inner instinct of the experienced can they be found. If one pricks them with a needle, neither pain follows nor any drop of blood; whereas both appear immediately if one pricks round about them, or if one has gone deeper than where those insensitive bloodless spots lie.

Such numbed spots differ from those that have arisen from some disease in that the latter are widespread, usually lie on the extremities, the flesh softens and dissolves, and they remain visible in all cases; whereas the former often become invisible, harden in the flesh, in no way hinder the use of the organs, and can extend over the whole body. In Lorraine some had this sign on the forehead, others at the back of the head, on the breast, on the back, on the hips, on the eyelids, on one of the shoulders, and on the most secret parts of the body. They had received it without pain, at the hour when they had become apostate from the faith; and the marked spots were as rigid and bloodless as limbs struck by lightning. In Labourd more than three thousand such marked persons had been found, among them a great number of children who had been at the Sabbath. To many the marks seemed also to have a certain external shape: a small cloud, a toad's foot, a hare's paw, a spider, a dog's or a horse's hoof; which, however, Maria von Sains denies.

The mark that de Vaulr in Stablo had on his back was, according to the testimony of the investigating judge Oranus, in the shape of a black cat; when pricked it was insensitive; but if one threatened it from behind with a finger without his noticing it, then it pained him so that he broke out in lamentations. The Palud was, according to Gaufredy's account, marked on the head, heart, belly, thighs, legs and in other places; and Maria von Sains declared that, since the marking often recurs and also indicates the rank of the marked person in the synagogue, the place where the sign is attached depends on the abomination which the marked one practiced. Concerning the manner of the marking the various testimonies did not agree; for most had taken part in the act in youth and could no longer remember whether it had been the women who performed it upon them, or whether the master himself had impressed the mark.

Among the sorcerers from Castile he had used a needle of counterfeit gold. Gaufredy reported: a special demon was charged with it, who with the claw of the little finger presses the mark; one feels a slight warmth which penetrates more or less deeply into the flesh, according as the act was more superficial or more penetrating. According to others it was the horn that performed the service; and one sees that all agree in the fact of the signing, but differ among themselves about the manner and mode according to their subjective apprehension, the degree of their vision, and according to the notions they have formed of the whole matter in their testimonies.

If we hold to this fact, we here see presented the counterpart of stigmatization. When the inner life, the lowest region in man, makes its covenant with the Lord, then it wills to free itself from the power of spiritual death which has entered it through sin, and now, like a disseminated vacuum interrupting its steady continuity, leads outward through disease to physical death. But if this life turns to the other side and unites itself with the lord of darkness, then it itself, being given over to inner death, may be scattered into it, entirely lose itself to that chosen lord; so that, that death remaining victorious alone within it, all inner struggle and contradiction would be dissolved, and then, as dying ends, undisturbed immortality in non-being would begin.

In the first case, therefore, the life of the holy person is transformed into the higher source of life with which the covenant was made; so that, having been assimilated by it after the expulsion of the intruding evil and the malady, he may be inspired and exalted in his life, and thus a broad, light- and life-soaked wave may pulse through the great organism. In the other case transformation and assimilation occur in the opposite direction; the good and the living are expelled, while the evil, the night and death are drawn in; so that life may arrive at consolidation in the ice-streams of the abyss, as the depths permit.

The ascending life-spirits have therefore there taken a new course; the higher ganglion which they have begun to brim is the Crucified; five fountains have been opened to them, corresponding to the five gates through which the higher life streams forth; and in the outflowing and the inflowing a new circuit of these spirits is formed. The surges and circulations in the blood which the nocturnal constellation excites in regular recurrence have linked themselves to another constellation and bound themselves to ecclesiastical periods; and the fluids, heavier and less mobile than the nerve-spirits, follow their currents, at least in their beginnings, by bleedings.

For the life-forces descending into the abyss the contrary will occur. The heart and center have been carried away into the depths, and they seek with it to balance themselves in a new current. But it is a heart turned inward; that which in it should be giving has become taking, namely life, and it takes from everything that allies itself with it; whereas that which should be taking, namely death, rather gives to it, without itself being warmed by it. Those who have entered into the new union therefore become only poorer in life and richer in death; and since life manifests itself in the blood by rapid circulation, and in the nerves by lively alertness, in them both the one and the other are diminished in the transformation into the power to which they have given their heart. \[Page 139\]

This transformation, however, will not take place here in the quintuple number of the currents; rather, as with the flagellation, it will be the whole outer surface over which those points of death will appear distributed; but not there bleeding and painful, rather failing blood and insensible. That mobility and power over the lower life, which appears in the higher ecstatic states, will also make itself felt in those of lower order. Maria von Sains said before those who examined her case, from 19 May to 10 June 1613, eighteen times in succession: that she had, during the preceding night, in the synagogue anew obtained the stigmatisation. There were usually seven, five or three places which she specified exactly; and if one followed her indication, and did not sometimes probe too deeply, one always found the places lifeless and bloodless, although very near by the blood would readily swell up. Notaries and many witnesses were present; also three physicians were present, who exhausted themselves in hypotheses to explain the apparition.

As with the wounds of the higher raptures no suppuration appears, and no true inflammatory process runs its course; so too is the sign of the deeper ones, because imprinted with death but round about surrounded by life, not the consequence of such a process; the spot is only small, no pus shows itself on it, or some putrefaction, and the flesh hardens much more. In Lorraine one found, as with the stigmatic marks, that the scar was at times surrounded by a fine rim or slight moisture; and it is only to be expected that Maria von Sains, in the repetition of the stigmatisation, should bear marks corresponding to the sins practised: the sexual and sodomitical ones upon the respective organs; the hands as marks at the sacrilegium; the head, however, as the sign of companionship with the synagogue. It is comprehensible that death enters at those places where sin has found its consummation; and an eruptive---or rather implanted---disease is thereby produced; a kind of eruption in which the interior casts the morbid material to the outside. By the reception the impulse is now at last unchained, so that it may freely follow its desire.

#### B. The Sabbath as Orgy and Feast of the Sorcerers and Witches

The whole drive, conceived as a totality, is now a complex of many drives, which all enter into the same underlying ground that unites them. If, then, the drive in general is directed towards a certain side, this direction will spring from the common ground, and this will press all those subordinated drives into that direction. The state which has been produced by the action of this diversion must therefore be best recognized and described if one, in order, investigates and sets forth the modalities in which, one after another, all these drives make themselves known in that direction, and in the course of this presentation follows the order in which one after another develops from the common root. Since we are therefore at present in the sphere of organic life, the life-drives that have their roots here will be the nearest objects of our consideration; and we must first look about to see how they behave in these infernal states, to what ends they are bent, and to what they are bound. Here then first presents itself that drive of life-preservation, which, as the drive to nourishment toward matter, to the self-generation of bodily life, is directed. This drive goes, like every other, here toward the abyss; and wishes, together with its master, to link the first beginning of a community of life. \[Page 140\]

He must therefore eat of his bread, and drink from his cup; so that, in taking this his portion from what is willingly set before him, a physical bond may weave back and forth between the master of the bread and the one who is sated. In this relation, then, Satan becomes steward of the meals in the household of those who had attached themselves to him, and they will sit at table with him.

Upwards, in the attitude of the mystics toward the Lord, the corresponding relation appears in the same realm. Between the two there is to be woven such a bond, and it is in the Eucharist that, in the naturally waking state, life with life is now linked in this bond. In the state of the mystics this bond is likewise present, but worked out more in its inward relations; and it is the center of the banquet of love which the souls united about their master celebrate. This meal, however, is a symbolic one; all the foods are therefore of symbolic nature, grown, blossomed and ripened in that garden which stands above the vault of heaven; and with such fruits we have constantly seen the tables of ecstatic saints covered. But those who have turned downward toward the realm of the abyss have set themselves to entwine the root of their being with the roots of the radical evil that dwells there. They therefore seek a bond that might unite their substance with his substance. That is the same fruit which in primeval times already gave such a bond, and whose enjoyment effects a beginning of transubstantiation in the one who eats. Because they still walk in the body, sin needs a bodily covering in which it offers itself to the bodily; the fruit is therefore of symbolic nature, enclosing its spiritual substance with a seeming-body in which appropriation takes place by the life directed toward it.

With such fruits, then, are the tables at their feasts of love or hatred covered; grown in that garden which brought forth the first ones, while the saints rejoice in the fruit of the tree of life. Those, however, who enjoy the curse-laden fruit also drink from the cup of the woman who sits upon the apocalyptic beast full of blasphemous names; and the chalice is filled with abomination and impurity, and the nations intoxicate themselves therein. They too drink their drunkenness from this cup; but it is not the pure flame of enthusiasm in which those glow who above have drunk the water of life; rather it is the dire fire that hell kindles in every one who has tasted of its Stygian wave.

If we hear the testimonies of the initiated about it, we hear them tell much: of rich banquets which they find prepared there; the tablecloths seem to be of gold cloth, and the boards are set most lavishly with roasts and pies, with fish and game; white and red wine are found in abundance, and are drunk from golden and silver cups, or even from little flagons. They sit at these tables, illuminated by green pitch-lights, higher or lower according to rank and means. But it is suspicious that in these feasts no salt, and indeed no bread at all, is to be found, and instead at most a cake of millet. Salt, however, is the enemy of all rot and decay, physical and, symbolically, moral; thus, as a symbol of the preserving principle, it may not be found at the dining-tables of the Destroyer. Every nourishing and satisfying food, upon which blessing rests, has already taken that first principle into its service; thus to the other remain only such things as serve neither for satiety nor nourishment. \[Page 141\]

Hence the testimony of many runs again in this way: when one seizes the outwardly inviting dishes, one finds nothing solid behind that semblance; all is but wind, and the deception reveals itself; those who imagine they have eaten and drunk at such meals afterwards feel as hungry as wolves. If in such cases there has been a lying semblance which mocked the partakers by making something completely non-existent appear to be apparently existent, then in others there will be something that was indeed once present but is now decayed or putrefied. The putrefaction is thus now clothed with the alluring deceit. Therefore other reports again run thus: these hellish dishes are prepared from carrion; the flesh of salted horses, pigs, dogs, cats is used; and the lack of salt and the insipid taste peculiar to these dishes point precisely to that. Still better, however, such substances will be suitable for the purpose when some crime has brought them into that condition, or when the feeding on them can only occur in a way contrary to nature. Human flesh will therefore be the most suitable for such banquets; especially when it has, as in the case of the hanged, been brought into the state by the person's own crime; or, as in the case of the murdered, by another's guilt, or by that of the revellers, into the state of death and putrefaction. That such cannibalism formed the blossom of these meals is attested by many statements of those who boasted of having been present at such things. Above all, for easily understandable reasons, the corpses of unbaptized dead children are prized; and, in their lack, also those who have received baptism, who are counted as the greatest delicacy. Johanna d'Abadie of Siboro, sixteen years old, testified that she had seen the corpses of several such children consumed; among others one which, as she said, belonged to Lieutenant Jean de Lasse. From him Maria Balcon had eaten the ear; yet never is an entire child eaten at the Sabbath of one parish, but of the same child only one quarter is consumed in Siboro, the three other parts in as many other parishes. All children whom they can seize are therefore carried to the Sabbath and there consumed. The crowning point of the whole matter is the eating of one another, and the devouring of the corpses of the dead from among the circle of the initiated; those, ever fed with such costly food, must in their turn serve as the most fitting nourishment for those who come later.

In the year 1610 in Logroño in Castile a number of people accused of witchcraft were tried; and these said among other things: On the night when a member of their association died, they go into the church and dig up the corpse. The father, the mother, or some other relative is accorded the honour of opening the body to take out the entrails, which are then reburied; the remainder is brought to the Sabbath. There the master commands the corpse to be dismembered, and then distributes the pieces. If anything remains over, the king of the Sabbath takes it with him and prepares for his friends a feast with it on the following day. As for the bones, they are put into pots until the following night; there they are boiled with a special herb which makes them as soft as turnips. They also boil soups of human flesh, with which they overload themselves to the point of vomiting. \[Page 142\]

In the case of small children they suck out the blood through the head or the navel; heart, lung and liver belong to the master, and the remainder is reserved for the king and queen of the Sabbath, that Satan may tear it into small pieces, and distribute these among those present according to his pleasure. Jeanne d'Abadie added: to those whom he wishes that they should never confess anything in court. Such exhumations and such child-devouring may, in individual cases, have taken place in sober reality; likewise, according to a report by R. Cessac (December 1609), a woman from Labourt was proved by witnesses who had seen her turn a portion of a child on a spit; and the convicted woman was therefore, as for other maleficia, sentenced to death. As a rule, however, when the intention of the covenanted ones is directed to a death of that sort, the action occurs for them immediately in the vision. All these hell-meals are therefore visionary acts; and inner, spiritual feedings are meant by them. In the foods consumed in them the truly substantial thing is the sin, the abomination and the unnaturalness that adhere to the spiritual element; the sensible is only the symbolical husk which, in passing through the bodily, wraps itself about this core; thus only the accidental, subject to appearance and fraudulent deception.

But whoever now eats food from the hand of Satan, which, taken, hardens into stone, and whoever drinks from his bowl the bitter, wild water, may also breathe in his atmosphere. For as the one ascending in God lives and weaves and breathes and is, so the one sinking downward into the vapor-circle of the abyss would live and weave and breathe and be. Just as nature converts taken food, through the life-air of the atmosphere, into blood for the flourishing of the body; just as mystics cause the fruits of life they have eaten to grow into spiritual blood in the breath of the divine Spirit which they draw into themselves; so to the demoniacal the enchanted food they have eaten is, in the mephitic exhalation they inhale, transformed into a poisoned psychic blood. For, as the specific substance of Satan is evil, so the dark aura which surrounds him is death --- not a mere absence of life, but a power truly hostile to it which contends with his, and, if victorious, overwhelms the one overcome. Those, then, who breathe such not-life but death-air take spiritual death into themselves; the bearer of this death is a poison which now itself circulates in their veins in the form of blood, and by degrees kills the life in them. The impression of the struggle of protecting, life-bringing forces with intruded hostile and destructive ones is, in organic life, fever and fever-heat. In the inner life an analogous feverish condition will therefore arise, and a glow of the evil fire will spread inward into the organism. In possessed persons we have sometimes seen such a blaze break out; in cases of obsession it too will not be wanting, although there, as in those cases, it only appears in rarer instances. As a rule the burning will be confined within the spiritual sphere, and only in self-objectification, as something thrust outward, will it show itself in the vision.

Those accused of witchcraft at Logroño recounted: at the Sabbath flames had leapt up into which they had thrown themselves, and in which they remained without danger or harm, not even their garments being affected. They had only been made to understand thereby that these were the summoned hell-flames which had blazed about them to take from them all fear and anxiety of them. But they were the spiritual flames that burned in them, and which therefore in the vision came forth from them. \[Page 143\]

As the mystical fire of a good sort in the saints consumes the flesh as the bearer of evil in man, so the fire of an evil signature, among the fiends, will undermine and consume the flesh as the bearer of what is good. Hence, in both cases there will appear a wasting and decay of the bodily in which the spiritual flame is kindled; yet this burning will become life for some, and death for others. The same glow will also burn in the other life-drives, especially the sexual drive; and if they are still green and vigorous, it will inflame them beyond all measure, or, if age has perhaps dulled them, it will bring them again to awakening. The ignition has taken place from within; the satisfaction must come by the same way. The organ appears only in inverse relation to the whole organism, and is indeed drawn into the sufferings as the objective element; but it plays only the second role, because the indwelling vital drive has taken the first. This drive, once kindled, now seeks to gratify its lust; and finds itself driven toward the same region where hunger and thirst had previously sought their satisfaction --- toward the abyss in which the instincts recognize a hearth of that volcanic life-fire which also glows within them. The spirit to which the maenad has bound herself is also to provide counsel and help here; thus he will, just as he was formerly master of the foods, now become host to harlots; and, as his feasts there proved to be visionary, so will his orgies appear of like nature, and all their proper reality will be contained only in spiritual substance.

For if a higher spiritual sense has detached itself from its organ and hovers free over it in ecstasy, then it can perceive an equally detached spirituality and be perceived by it without the organ immediately intervening --- which is required only where knower and known are latently bound in it to such an one. The same will now happen with the lower life-drive when the inwardly resident force of its organ has parted from it; it can then perceive like things and be perceived by them without the immediate interposition of the bearer. There will therefore also be a vision in these realms that concerns the sexual relation; in which the bodily indeed co-operates, but which in reality is effected in the demonic region implanted in it. This relation can then reach over into the purely spiritual regions, or the drive may seek satisfaction in mixed natures. In the first case it will strive toward its complementary opposite among the spiritual powers, and the bodily will be drawn in only one-sidedly. In the other case the dissolved interiors of both will meet, and the exterior will then secondarily enter into a magnetic interplay.

In the natural sexual relation there will now attach either the blessing of fertility, in a harmoniously ordered germ of life, or the curse of barrenness, and possibly a disharmoniously constituted and monstrously developing foetus, to the act. In the vision, however, when the spiritual in this drive is exalted and chastened, and, in ascending symbolism, casts off all that is bestial and turns to the source from which it flowed forth; and as, for example, in the physical order the earth unites with the sun, so it joins in an ordered mystical marriage with the universal spiritual source of life --- then the outpouring grace in this marriage will reveal itself as the blessing of fertility; and the birth will be a spiritual being, in which the mother, as if by overshadowing, only receives, nourishes, and brings forth bodily into the light. \[Page 144\]

That then will be the mystical marriage of which that ecstatic Magdalena Buttler of the monastery of Buken reports: how she had concluded such a one with the Lord, and how to him, in due course, seven children were born --- Chastity, Poverty, Obedience, etc., and just as many virtues; the nature and being of which she then describes at length, even down to their clothing. But if the spiritual, being undisciplined and let loose, after the higher light in it has gone out, glows in a dark flame, has descended into and become fixed in the mere bestial impulse, and in its narrow containment is kindled to madness, and then moves downward where it feels the hearth of that flame, and unites itself with the principle of the depths to fornication --- then the curse will flow in this connection. The birth will indeed also be a spiritual one, but sin in it has become merely flesh, and appears throughout the whole brood of vices, only specifically graded according to family likeness. As those virtues there are poured in as graces, so here these vices will transfuse themselves as temptations; and the whole action will mean nothing more than the begetting-act of these vices in their living ground; just as that higher mystical symbolism would indicate the conception of those graces. For virtue and vice, if they are to dwell vivified in man, must have a principle of life in him; this was implanted for evil at the first transgression in the germ, and is then bequeathed to the following as hereditary guilt.

Since the Sabbath is a popular festival in these mystical regions, it is understood that all accounts coming thence to this side are in every respect popular in character, and occupy themselves exclusively with the grossly fleshly act in its kind. De Lancre adduces circumstantial statements made before the commission on this point; of these we will here cite only the general and instructive, passing over the particular, repulsive and obscene.

He reports among other things that the girls and women of Labourd, instead of blushing over the damned affair and bewailing their offense, had told the court all the circumstances and the filthiest detail with such shamelessness and pleasure that one saw how they took a pride in it, and found a special gratification in the telling, because they preferred the filthy caresses of the demon to anything else. They did not redden in the least, whatever slippery and unclean question was put to them; so that our interpreter in Basque, who was a priest, felt more shame in translating our questions to them than they did in answering them --- and these were girls of thirteen to fourteen years, answering quicker than one could ask. That, however, applied only to the girls who had known nothing else than that school; and in their ignorance they may have believed they had to do with a god, and therefore told everything outright. Among them there were indeed also some who could be brought to loathing of the vice; and who then, as far as they were able, strove to free themselves from Satan.

The old Hauber-women, however, took care not to disclose the matter; and if they were pressed sharply about it, they endured everything as if they had the best of causes to keep. One must be thankful to the one from whom Maria Dindarte of Sare testified: that she had, when Satan took liberties with her, begged him first to give her another shape; which he also granted her. This remainder of shame, which, it would seem, is ineradicably implanted in man, and even in these scenes of prostitution is not entirely displaced, showed itself also in that, whereas everything else otherwise happened openly, the affair was hidden from the children present by a thick cloud which rose between Satan and them. \[Page 145\]

At the assembly it was, moreover, just as on earth: the most beautiful and the youngest were considered the most valuable; the most distinguished sat in splendid dress at the side of the master of the chair, and were regarded as the queens of the Sabbath. When therefore the meal and the dance were over, he took them, or whoever else pleased him best, aside; brought them, according to the testimony of sixteen-year-old Margarethe von Sare, to a silken bed; and then did with them as he pleased --- the more unnatural and hateful to God, the better. In every pleasure, especially in those unbridled ones, there lies a sting and a barb; that likewise took hold of them in this case and pressed.

In the statements it is expressed in a very graphic manner. All confess, as Remy also assures us, that nothing colder and more unpleasant could be imagined than such deeds; and Nicolea Morelia affirmed that whenever she was separated from such wretched dealings she had to lie down and rest, as if she had grown weary from prolonged driving and hunting. They all complained that, completely against their will, they had to have dealings with the spirits; and it did not help them, however much they might struggle. Moreover the spirits were jealous; none would tolerate another courting their own. Nicolea Morelia's husband testified in this connection that when she became of age, and there was much ghostly activity about her, she was consequently often and severely beaten by her own family.

Unmarried persons were not readily chosen, because otherwise the opportunity to commit adultery on the side would be lacking; they were therefore kept for later. Just as everyone had to give themselves up to their master, so were they dependent on one another in him. Jeanette d'Abadie testified that she had seen men and women mingle without distinction at the Sabbath. The Devil gave, she said, the watchword, assigning each person to another who most violated nature and custom: the daughter to the father, the son to the mother, the sister to the brother, the baptized child to the godparent, the confiding penitent to the confessor --- without any distinction of age or status. That had happened to her herself countless times; she, who outside the Sabbath never incurred a misstep, there, since her thirteenth year, at Satan's command did everything he ordered without hesitation, because the responsibility then fell on him. It was a continual filth in which all wallowed; and it is understandable that here a kind of virtual practice of all that a certain class of books sets forth theoretically appears.

Besides, according to the same witness's testimony the same was true here as in intercourse with the demon; the fundamental motive in all of it was simply depravity; and Remy records Petron, the shepherd of Dalheim, as confessing: whenever he embraced the Abrahele, he immediately became rigid in all his limbs --- a testimony that fully makes clear the nervous, convulsive state in which the participants found themselves. Since the act takes place in a manner contrary to the order of nature, no natural offspring can proceed from it. That same Jeanette also stated explicitly that from those unions, whether with the master or with the other persons present at the Sabbath, no one ever became pregnant; a statement to which, however, others objected. On closer inspection it soon appears that either popular interpretation and interpolation has crept in, or that this phenomenon of demonic, magnetic elective affinity plays itself out only from conception to birth. \[Page 146\]

The first occurs with that belief which is expressed most clearly in a statement by Remy, where it says: one calls the children that spring from such debauchery "children of Adam." They wept day and night, were heavy as lead, sucked dry, misshapen, always hungry and emaciated, and nothing thrived on them, even if five nurses took them to suckle. Those are the so-called Kiel-kröpfe, children afflicted with rickets or cretinism; a natural evil whose cause Bolk believed to be found in such demoniacal relations. Proceeding from the principle that all evil has come into the world through evil, this opinion --- which, as is well known, Luther also cherished --- forgot that once such an evil exists it reproduces itself according to laws of necessity, and in its separate appearances by no means always needs a special causality through whose perverse action it arose. In this way, it seems, that delusion was formed which, to the misfortune that pressed upon these helpless creatures, now also added the evils of mankind's loathing; this, in turn, was alleviated among the people by the belief that the misfortune was derived from the house through them. Many of these unfortunates have nevertheless become victims of this delusion; for it was then customary in Lorraine that midwives quietly got rid of them.

The other mode reveals itself in what is recorded elsewhere in many confessions about the so-called elves or evil things. These were worm-like or entozoic formations which many of the arrested women confessed to having received on such occasions; and which, after they had carried them in an apparently regular pregnancy, finally came to light, whereupon they were buried in the earth. That the impulse toward the same, indeed an even more intensive inflammation --- which externally ignites in nymphomania --- excites in the organs a process that, immediately entering the rhythm prevailing there, runs through all the forms and symptoms of a pregnancy without any bodily foetus being present, is easily understood from what has been adduced earlier, and such a process has its analogue in the domain of nature. This pregnancy will then be able to advance in the realm of vision just as it had its beginning there; and in the same way it will there also be brought to an end.

What such women under these circumstances thus declared about themselves was taken from the history of the course of this spiritual pregnancy; it was the vice of unnatural debauchery that had become alive in them because it had implanted itself in the ground of their inner life. That which had been conceived within them had passed through its stages, with all the symptoms of an ordinary pregnancy; but it falls into their inner life, drawing the outer only into compassion. The process must end in a delivery which, however, because the fruit was conceived in the intus-(inward) reception and therefore takes place in the inner world, becomes visible to the outer world only in vision; hence the accounts run to a burial of the thing born. It is moreover not necessary, not even probable, that the whole occurrence remained without any external envelope. The dreadful inflammation of the forces must also have brought about a volcanic burning of the organ; and these organic processes in it, as in the possessed the inflammatory condition of the entrails, give rise to --- Görres, chridl. Monte. 1v. v. 15 --- whose extent and nature we are not able to measure. It is an unholy disease that has seized the individual in this region, and can now form concretions of the kind of hydatids which perhaps arise in the closely closed chambers of the brain, and in which the temporal evil both finds its course and finally its crisis.

#### C. The Witch Physiognomy and the Witch Stench

\[Page 147\]

A life that thus passes its days in abominations of every kind will also outwardly express the inner tornness in a corresponding distortion, which is expressed in the popular saying: "ugly as a hag!" To this first belongs what popular belief has preserved concerning the characteristic features of witch-physiognomy. The traits of this portrait must have been taken from such specimens as had brought that matter to virtuosity; and were then, given the hardness of the human heart, found and applied everywhere where age, poverty, misery, ill-treatment, in prison and on the rack, among old unhappy women who either did not at all or only very superficially partake, produced similar, and accordingly interpretable, features.

A canonical example of the first kind, however, seems to have been that Necato of de Lancre, of whom he tells us much and whom he thus describes. She, whose name already anagrammatically and hieroglyphically pointed to her fate and her kind, had set aside the nature of her sex in order to make a man of her, or rather a hermaphrodite. For she had altogether the expression, the speech and the bearing of a man; indeed of an exceedingly rude, dark-hued and sun-tanned one, like a forest-devil or savage who never left the woodlands and the open fields. She was bearded like a satyr, had small, deep-set, wild eyes, with an expression of ferocity like a wild cat; at the same time so flashing and dreadful that the children and maidens whom she brought to the Sabbath, and whom we confronted with her, could not endure her gaze; although she, out of consideration for us and in view of the justice, made every effort to moderate it, and by taming that natural savageness to move it toward some mildness. One believed one could plainly discern in her that she was accustomed to rest her eye upon that fearful object, after whose model she had adopted her raging and dreadful expression.

Another consequence of the inner dissolution is the smell which those initiated into these mysteries emit from their mouths and whole bodies; which thereupon communicates itself to their clothes, and transfers a pestilential stench onto all who come near them, and fills the houses, the air and all neighboring places so that it endures for a long time. In these words Brognoli has described the condition of the demoniacs; and the testimony of all exorcists agrees with this result. Not only is the whole body infected with this stench; every single secretion from the mucous membranes, the kidneys, &c., is marked by the same infection. Opposite the odor of holiness on the good side therefore stands, in full truth, the stench of unholiness; which proclaims itself so decisively that the elders accordingly called them the Foetentes, and the Gascons called them the Fetilléres. Just as the sweet scent of the saints tends to increase with every holy action they perform, so the stench of the unholy will increase and decrease with the degree of depravity to which they have sunk; and with each manifestation of them will only be concentrated.

We have ascribed that sweet scent to the production of an ethereal oil which develops in the simplified life-process, under the influence of a higher illumination, like the aromas in a blossom. The foul smell must therefore likewise be ascribed to the production of a putrid and inflammable animal oil, which is generated in the depressed life in the flames that burn through it; as the sharp and caustic or stupefying juices are produced under the sun's burning in poisonous plants. \[Page 148\]

Sharpened emanations tend already in ordinary life to accompany every deviation from moral harmony, which is immediately met by a corresponding natural dissonance; for the sharpened sense of the saints testifies to this, who, as we have seen, have smelled the sins of those who approached them, particularly the sins of the flesh; whereas the expression "stinking pride" seems to render this vice intelligible to the common understanding. A habitual intimacy with evil will therefore also render such a production permanent, and will thereby increase it both qualitatively and quantitatively so that no specially heightened sense is needed to perceive its presence; rather it forces itself upon ordinary powers of perception.

While, therefore, to the saints a conservative power is given which remains dominant even through frailty and sickness, and preserves in them the sweet odour even in conditions which otherwise unavoidably are associated with foul smell, yea even preserves them uncorrupted after death; in the demonic a destructive principle seizes, piercing even through their health: so that their healthy body already, like a cancerous ulcer, is foul-smelling, and, at death, rapid and swift dissolution and putrefaction follow. This is already hinted at in life by the uncleanness into which they must be brought; for the statements of many in their interrogations ran as follows: the unclean spirit does not allow them to wash themselves in the morning. It was therefore even believed that daily washing of the hands, and commending oneself to God's protection before going out, gave security against witchcraft; and Mugeta von Essem warned her husband earnestly about this, even before her burning at Remy.

### Chapter 2. Personal States of the Psychical, Middleman in Witch and Sorcery-Being

The transition into this region is effected, from the sphere of life, by the systems of voluntary movement in the torso of man. This torso is indeed built up from below by life, and is maintained by life in its existence; but it is destined chiefly to serve the psychical man as carrier, and as an organ to be borne and ruled by him. In the ordinary relations of reciprocal subordination it now rests firmly upon the support of the earth; and the column about which it is gathered is upheld by the rooted lower extremities, though it is also moved from place to place. But if the relation is annulled by the inwardly supporting (principle) obtaining predominance over the outwardly supported, then the dynamic in the organ becomes preponderantly powerful over the outwardly heavy, material; it withdraws into itself, and, concentrating more deeply, it masters the externally downward-drawing forces more and more.

In contrast to the common centre of gravity of these forces, another such point is found for the totality of the opposing fighters; and in the conflict of both points, on the one hand the position of the first is drawn more upward, and on the other hand the sum of the forces set upon walking and moving is outweighed by that of the winged, and, in the midst of the increased mobility, the possibility of flight movement may develop. Thus it must be the case in every inward-turning (process), whether its final aim be directed toward height or toward the abyss; the opposite modality will only appear with the externalization, where in the latter case the inwardly supporting is bound by the outwardly supported, and the whole act appears more in the character of a mere lower natural performance. An analogue of this will show itself in external nature, where with the earth's gravity a higher or deeper gravity, in the sun- or moon-gravity, connects, and now the union or counter-effect of these moments alone determines the total effect. \[Page 149\]

This total effect will then manifest themselves in the flood and ebb of the sea, and in the flood the earth-element, freed from earthly gravity, will rise in ascent; not only, however, where the other acting moments intervene at the zenith, vertically and in opposition, upon terrestrial gravity; but also at the point diametrically opposite, where they, though apparently confirming it, reinforce their effect by their own. If, therefore, the evil spirit has become the center of attraction for the spirits turned toward him, then the effect of this spirit-gravitation will also become visible in the realm of the physical in man; he will in part be unchained from it, as is the one who has surrendered himself to the Lord. But if the latter gains release from that power, so that it may be the expression of his higher, inward liberation, then the other is only torn away from his natural bent in order to sink into a more shameful servitude. Just as the Kabbalists call the bearer or organ of a power its chariot, so the Elijah-chariot of the mystics is the higher power, while the fiery chariot of the demonic is the lower --- Satan, who carries them over into his realm.

#### A. The Witches' Ride

The demonic, in organic life, by the nature of the process taking place there, predisposed to a specific lightness, and therefore belonging to the family of night-birds, are further driven in this direction by the distribution of forces in the organ of motion; so that they, too, like the possessed, do not lack the flight-membrane of the inner man, whose swing the outer must then follow. This character will therefore be characteristic for the whole class, and whatever in any way touches this region will already appear tinged with it. It has accordingly been remarked that even children who once took part in the Sabbath have already acquired this tendency to become buoyant.

Remy gives a clear example properly attested by witnesses, which we will cite from him here on account of its singularity. Franziska Haquart, who stood before the court in the year 1587, had, when her daughter Fana was only seven years old, given her over to the unclean spirit, so that he would thereafter leave her untroubled. She immediately reported this to the judge, and the daughter's testimony agreed with the mother's statement. On account of her youth she was released, while the mother had to atone with fire. A respectable matron thereupon took the child in hand and urged her to the fear of God, to bring her back from the godless condition. It succeeded so well that at last people entirely came to believe that it had been altogether accomplished. \[Page 150\]

Then it happened that, one night when she lay in bed between two maids, she was suddenly borne aloft, as if the spirit would take her with it. How likely --- it would indeed have actually happened --- had not the maids prevented it by their cry: "Lord Jesus, help!" When the spirit thus saw his work disturbed, he left his prey hanging up among the beams, and departed. The maids did not invent this; the whole neighborhood attested to what had occurred. For at the cry for help from the maids everyone hastened in and had seen how everything was arranged. The stiffness in which the little maid was found, her pitiable condition, and the fact that for eight whole days she took no food, remaining continually awake and silent, proved that no deceit had crept in. The very rigidity in which the child was found testifies that her condition had been nervous; that in the seizure she had spasmed locally, and was then borne aloft as far as the space permitted. What of demonical in the matter there may have been remained behind from the former direction which the mother had given the child, and was therefore accidental. The Bishop of Pamplona, Pr. von Sandoval, relates in his History of Charles V, on the occasion of a witch-trial that was held before the royal council in Navarre, the following fact. He wished to satisfy himself by personal inspection as to the cause of the circumstances there occurring, and therefore promised clemency to an old witch, from among the others, if she would perform her sorcery in his presence. The old woman accepted the proposal and asked for her ointment-box, which had been taken from her; and then she, in the company of the commissioner and many other persons, climbed up a tower. There she placed herself at a window and, with the ointment, rubbed her flat hand, her loins, the joints of the elbow, the underside of the arm, the shoulder and the left side. Then she called with a loud voice: "Art thou present?" Everyone present then heard a voice in the air say: "Yes, here I am!" The witch then began to descend the tower, head downwards, using her hands and feet in the fashion of lizards. When she had thus reached about the middle of the height, she took flight into the air; and the eyes of those present followed her until the horizon hid the flyer. All remained full of astonishment at what they had seen, and the commissioner caused it to be announced that a considerable sum of money would be given to whoever should bring the escaped woman back. After two days the shepherds brought in the one found. The commissioner asked her why she had not flown farther away in order to escape the inquiries of those searching for her. She answered that her master had only undertaken to conduct her three hours' distance, and had then left her in the field where the shepherds found her. Llorente relates in his History of the Inquisition the course of this affair, which ended with whipping and several years' imprisonment for the 150 participants involved. \[Page 151\]

The example of the Indian brahmin, who, according to the testimony of many English witnesses, sat suspended in the air upon a staff, appears akin to this fact. Where such occurrences take place, therefore, it is not absolutely necessary to infer demonic agency; other natural forces may also intervene in such cases. Thus Rémy relates from his records: Once, in the German Vosges, near Huncaria, a violent storm arose with thunder and lightning; the shepherds, for protection against the tempest, had withdrawn with their cattle into the woods. There they suddenly saw two peasants hanging high up in the tree-tops, and their minds were so stunned and distraught that one could clearly see they had not climbed there intentionally but had arrived by some accident. The state of their clothing, covered with dirt as if they had been dragged over stick and stone, meanwhile aroused the suspicion that demonic force had placed them in the trees; and this seemed to be confirmed when, after they had sat there for a while and no one was watching them, they came down and vanished. Afterwards arrested, they freely confessed what the shepherds had asserted of them.

Likewise, once in Bellmont during a storm two men --- a certain Rothar and another called Amantius --- fell from a cloud onto a roof. The first had expressed great concern in that position about how they might come safely to the ground; the other, however, had replied laughingly, "Be calm, fool! for he who has us in his power can do still more." And indeed they were seized by a whirl and forthwith brought down to the earth uninjured; whereby the whole house trembled so that it seemed shaken to its foundations. The inhabitants were all unanimous in their testimony as to the circumstances and the day on which it happened.

Again, Cunin, a magistrate of Roncas, in December 1586 had been attending to business out on the meadow; and since the sky proved very stormy, he set out in haste for home. Suddenly a lightning strike had uprooted six oaks around him, and a seventh, which had remained standing, was torn and riven as if by claws. As he now hurried home all the more, having only lost his hat, he saw on the top of the oak a woman who seemed to have been set down there from the cloud. He recognized her, and called to her: Are you the ill-famed Margaretha Warma, upon whom, as I now see, suspicion of witchcraft has not been groundless; how then have you come here? She answered: Conceal what you have now seen; no smallest ill shall from me befall you and yours in the future! Cunin swore to his statement before the judge, and Warma confirmed it by her confession, without the use of torture, and at the last moment.

Del Rio relates a fourth case as equally beyond doubt. He was at Calais in 1587, when Archduke Albert took the town; on the bridge toward Boulogne, where the enemy lay, the Walloon outposts were posted. Two of them saw in the evening, under a clear sky, a blackish cloud approach; and heard confused voices issue from it, without being able to distinguish anything. Because they mistrusted the matter, one fired his arquebus; and then a drunken, naked, rather stout woman of middle age, wounded, fell from the cloud at their feet, who acted foolishly and could hardly say anything but: Are enemies or allies about here? \[Page 152\]

In those first cases there are sworn judicial attestations; Del Rio appeals to many eyewitnesses; there must have been some basis of truth in the facts. Natural explanations, on the other hand, must be admitted as long as they are not found to be insufficient. Storm and bad weather were, except in the last case, always involved. It is contrary to natural instinct that people should have sought shelter on trees and roofs for the purpose of shooting at them; but it is possible that they were perhaps whirled up by a waterspout, which would have produced their bewildered state of mind and, because of the violence of the occurrence, led them themselves to believe that it had been the work of the devil. If this interpretation is rejected by the circumstances, then that which arises from becoming suspended in magnetic states comes into play; and only when the person's previous life also accords with it will the assumption of demonic influence be justified.

If the impulse to hover seizes simultaneously many who are connected in demonic rapport, and if these impulses are all directed to the same distant goal, to the place of the Sabbath, then thereby the excursion will be formed; and the next question must now arise: are the participants in this excursion bodily and physical, in real locomotive movement, to that place, or are they present there only outwardly in appearance and in a spiritual manner; that is, are they present in the one place without being at the same time present at the other, distant place? Some have accepted both kinds of presence, and in order to prove the reality of the former have repeatedly adduced facts which, as invented out of the air, can be dismissed; rather, a more exact inquiry is required. The two most important \[cases\] to us here must be those that Fr. Bartholomew de Spina has set forth in his book. An eminent physician of Ferrara, who in that city is especially devoted to the care of the poor sick, called Sozinus Bentius, has in the last days told me the following with the most sincere truthfulness.

He said that three years ago he had been in the country to look after his estates, and there he had by chance fallen into a conversation with his farmer about the witches. The physician had maintained that all that is told about them is mere imagination; especially, he said, if one believes that they physically set out on the ride. The farmer, however (who is still living and is called Thomasinus Pollastros, born indeed in the district of Mirandula, but now residing in that neighborhood in the place called Clavica Malaguzzi), answered that he knew a peasant who lived nearby and who himself, with his own eyes, by night had seen men and women in great numbers who danced and gave themselves up to all manner of lusts. The doctor was astonished at this remark and begged his bailiff to bring that peasant to him. He came, and, when asked about the matter, gave the following account. \[Page 153\]

One night, when I had risen three hours before dawn in order to bring my oxen and my cart to my tenant to assist him in some business, and had thereby come to that plain to which he pointed with his hand because it lay near, I saw from afar many fires in different places, like great lights; and between them a great multitude of men and women who as it were quarrelled among themselves, or else danced together. But when I came nearer I beheld, in the bright light which the fires shed around them, more than six thousand people; and there were tables set up at which many sat and made merry with food and drink; several danced and practised various games; others took out things about which it is indecorous to speak at greater length. Among the crowd I saw some men and women already known to me, and I spoke with several. But after an hour all rose at a certain signal, hurried away, and vanished as if in a mist.

On this testimony the physician changed his opinion, and held that what he had formerly declared to be delusion was not only possible but really did occur. The same author reports: Brother Paulus of Caspan of his order assured him that a priest, J. Ant. von Palavisinis, an honorable man who lives at Caspani in the Veltlin, had told him the following. When, before dawn, he rises as usual to perform divine service or to attend to other business, it has often happened to him that he has seen a great number of men and women in a neighboring plain running about with lights as if in play, and he has recognized them as witches and sorcerers in their assembly.

In both accounts the persons, the place, the time and the occasion are exactly specified; the witnesses who give them are not suspect, and they have taken down what was told; one must believe that they saw what they testify they saw. Yet their testimony by no means proves that the company seen was actually present at that place. One has, namely, neglected to verify whether the seers did not possess the second sight, and whether the Sabbath observed was not seen in a vision. The vision of the tenant of Glenarz and of a son at Inverness on the Gairan bridge has arisen from this source. The seers have, in the very content of the vision, seen an actual rider on the road whose horse the teamsters seemed to urge on with bayonets. Just as these saw an army, so could his Italian seers behold a revel without its being spatially present at that time. The statements of witnesses in judicial inquiries that they saw dancers under the trees as they passed by can in part be interpreted in the same way.

As is well known, the circles in the grass around trees, chestnuts for example, in which not a single herb ever grows, have been regarded as witch-circles. Various natural explanations of this phenomenon have been sought, among others the supposition of masonry existing beneath them. But at least this explanation Strozzi Cicogna has found to be invalid. At Castelnuovo in the Vicentino such a circle was found. Strozzi had excavations made; one found nothing but earth, like in the places beside it. \[Page 154\]

Many other narratives circulate concerning such gatherings, said to have been held truly and bodily, remote from human intercourse, into which eyewitnesses accidentally stumbled. Besides the fact that in these reports it is never clearly shown whether what was seen was not either merely too corporeal, or not rather a vision, all these accounts lack the external authenticity that would be required to admit them as testimonial evidence. There is the peasant from the Sabine country, near Rome, whom his wife persuaded to anoint himself. He is at once led under the walnut tree near Benevento, where he finds many gathered who eat and drink and make merry. He does as the others; but since the unsalted dishes do not please his taste, he repeatedly asks for salt. He finally receives what he demanded, and then says: "Praise be to God, now that this salt has come." Immediately everything falls apart, the spell vanishes, and the man is left alone. He must painfully beg his way home; he then accuses his wife along with others whom he had seen there; they confess and are all burned. Grillandus, who relates the story in the first book of his work De sortilegiis, gives no names and adduces no witnesses; but even if the matter were best investigated on that side, it would not prove what it sets out to prove. For the peasant had been anointed, and thus was subject to all the enchantments that commonly accompany that condition.

The women who rode out used to put the men at their sides to sleep by applying the salve, so as not to be disturbed by them in their proceedings. Bertranda, the barber's wife in Forbach, confessed that on such occasions she, with her anointed right hand, plucked at her companion's ear, whereupon he then fell asleep. Exactly the same thing occurs in the trial of the witch of Loches in Bodin, who calls it a matter still quite fresh in memory. She and her husband are transported from Loches to the heaths of Bordeaux, fifteen days' journey away. The husband says: "My God, where are we?" Immediately everything scatters; there is a trial, and the woman confesses everything without coercion. Thus in the year 1525 a girl from the duchy of Spoleto, thirteen years old, is led in by a witch; the girl, amazed at all she sees, cries out: "Blessed God, what is this?" Everything has vanished; in the morning a peasant finds her in the field.

Torquemada, in the third book of his work, relates: a sorcerer persuades a man to ride with him, and the latter consents. He then takes him by the hand, and they fly through the air very far off. There they find the Sabbath assembled. But the newcomer loses patience and cries out: "God --- what a great noise!" Immediately a whirlwind and a storm break in, and everything is scattered. It takes him three years before he comes back to his native place. The generality and indefiniteness with which these narratives are framed proves that they rest upon popular legend. This legendary character appears still more plainly in what William of Newburgh relates of an incident that happened, when he was still a boy, in the province of Deir, not far from his birthplace. \[Page 155\]

From a place near the eastern sea, where the river Vispe is situated, a peasant had gone to visit his friend in the neighbouring village and returned late at night in a not entirely sober frame of mind. From the nearest hill, not far from the road --- the one I have often seen --- he heard the voice of a merry company. He wondered who could make such a noise so late at night; and when he saw a door in the side of the hill, he went in to look. He found there a large, brightly lit chamber, and many men and women sitting as at a feast. One of the serving attendants, when he saw him standing in the doorway, brought him a cup, which he took; but, because he hesitated to drink, he poured out its contents; then he tucked the cup away and withdrew. Thereupon there arose an uproar inside on account of the cup; the guests pursued him, but he escaped them thanks to the excellence of his horse, and reached his home safely. The cup, of unknown material, unusual colour and peculiar shape, came to the elder Henry, King of England; then to David, the brother of the Queen, and long preserved in the Scottish treasury. A few years ago, as the legend says, it was handed over to King Henry II, who wished to see it, by the Scottish William. The hill in this tale is the old Benusberg, into which the Wild Host rides every year; the cup, however, is the Oldenburg drinking-horn which Count Otto won in the hunt from the maiden who, emerging from the Osen- or Asen-mountain, offered it to him filled with a draught which he poured out; the horn, spurring his horse, he carried away. The Teutonic legend, transplanted to England, there received only local colouring. \[Page 156\]

But this legend takes another turn again in an inquiry conducted by Remy, where it appears as if it were a historical happening. In Lützen, at the foot of the Vosges, in May of the year 1580, the neighbours celebrated a kind of carnival; and Claudius Chotey had returned at night to the place Wisembach. He had already half climbed the mountain that lay between the two places; then, in an otherwise clear, calmer air, he was seized by a vortex and now looked about him, astonished at what might be happening around him. There, at a place apart on the edge of the cliff, he saw six masked women dancing around a table set with many silver and gold vessels, flinging their heads about like the possessed; with them, on a black ox, sat a man who watched their revels. When he stood there, to look at the matter more closely, all was lost to his eyes. He went forward, and when he had already come over the crest of the mountain, he saw those women following him, still silently swaying their heads. Before them was the one with the dark face who made at him a clawing look; but he defended himself against her with his sword, so that the assailant fled. The women in the meantime returned with their leader a third time, and Chotey, now bolder, went nearer and recognised Desiderius Garete, to whom he then gave his word that he would keep secret what he had seen. Another vortex or mist seized him again and brought him to a distant place, from which he at last reached his home. He had reported it to the magistrate. The same had, however, nearly in the same words been told to the magistrate by Barbelina Careta, one of the women, adding: Desiderius had purchased the witness's silence with much wheat and two grown calves; and it was not true, as he had said, that they had attacked him because he had come too near the table, but because he had attempted to steal a cup.

One sees that a private carnival-night lay at the root of the whole scene; it was held in the darkness of the forest, and night and wine did the rest. This is also confirmed by the third form of the tale, as told by Joachim Kämmerer of Bamberg. A butcher was walking through a little wood at night; there he hears a noise and a dancing, goes up to it --- and the dancers vanish. He now sees silver goblets standing there, takes them, and brings them to the authorities. They thereupon arrest, as witches, those whose marks were upon the goblets, together with others who had been denounced, and execute them all together. That they, says Lerchheimer of Steinfelden (who tells the story), were witches is to be inferred from the fact that they had accused others whom the devil, in a dream --- as if they had been together there --- had shown to them. They had lain at home and slept; meanwhile the devil kept watch, and carried the goblets from their benches to that place. Who would willingly keep a feast and dance by night in the rough, dark wood, in the wind, in cold and rain? Their goblets were found there, therefore they had been there. \[Page 157\]

By the same line of reasoning it once happened that, in a distinguished city in Germany, the authorities were deceived so far as to hang an innocent locksmith because his lock-picks had been found at a place where money had been stolen from a chest. But another had taken his lock-picks and used them, which he afterwards confessed. Yes, some --- those who ought to admonish judges to fairness and leniency --- are so perverse toward the poor man: when the husband testifies about his wife that she was on that night, the very night she is said to have been at the dance and to have been seen there, never out of bed and lying on his side, then they say and argue: in the bed lay a specter, but the true body had been outside. Dear sirs, why do you not invert this and interpret it --- not to the devil's discredit, but for the good of man --- so that the true body lay in bed and the false one was outside? Is it not a principle with you that, in doubtful matters, one should always prefer the milder to the harsher? --- One must say there is good and sound common sense in these words. Meanwhile many of the accused themselves had voluntarily sworn: they had left their child's pillows in the bed in their place; others a broom, a scarecrow, or even their own spirit as a succubus.

The age that entertained such an excess of belief that the ordinary, prosaic world thereby stood in danger of disappearing in the same way as the invisible world is in danger now through present unbelief, accepted this account without the smallest doubt. What Binsfeld, an upright and very reliable man, relates from the Trier records may well demonstrate the possibility of such real abductions; but it does not suffice to establish the reality of such assemblies. He adduces, first, a noteworthy example of an invisible child-abduction to prove the power of imperceptible forces in the matter. The wife of Johann Eysenkopf, a burgher of Wilmar, called Margaretha, had borne a little boy named Conrad. A spirit often stole him from the cradle, before and after her laying-out \[i.e. the funeral-like rite?\] --- from the feast of the Resurrection to that of the Departure of the Apostles --- and carried him to other places. Once he laid him in the mother's bed, another time he hid him beneath the steps of the cellar-stair; at times he carried him to the loft or to the privy. But so that no harm should befall the child in these happenings, he always placed cloths under him which he had likewise secretly stolen from the parents.

Once, when the mother destroyed such a bed as the spirit had prepared in the bathing-room, her face and hands swelled up, as far as they were not covered by her clothes, and her skin peeled off. At times the spirit would also rock the little boy, and he always cried when his mother had put him into the cradle, but was perfectly calm when the spirit had carried him to another place. The dean of the place, W. Lyndner, wrote to Binsfeld for remedy, and the latter advised the use of sacramentals. They were applied, and the older people also undertook a pilgrimage, whereupon the matter subsided for a time. But soon the consecrated objects were found torn away, and the invisible one began his game again. All that was told had, at the dean's request, been authentically recorded by the local notary. \[Page 158\]

One sees that here again one of those spectral apparitions was at work. Binsfeld then relates further. On 22 September 1589 the peasant Michael from Longen, in the Amt of Pfalzel, was executed for witchcraft; he confessed among other things that he had been led at Christmas to the Sabbath at the cross of Longwich, on this side of the Moselle, but had only arrived there after the dispersal of the assembly. Thereupon he cried out, "Lord God, it is already over!" In the same instant he had fallen down into the field, and about eleven o'clock at night had gone to the Moselle, put himself into a boat across the stream, and gone to bed. In the year 1591, on 4 May, Martin of Corlingen was burned there; he confessed that twice, on the return from the Sabbath, he had been thrown into the bushes near Pellingen because he had said, "O God, how did we come to be here?" Once, he said, when during the dearth he had bought a sack of wheat in the town, he had been carried over the wall together with the purchase. Anna Meisenbein of Cologne had gone to the assembly on the Hetzenrodter heath; after its conclusion she quarrelled with her daughter and beat her in the presence of her son. The mother, the daughter, and the son had all given this account in complete agreement.

One sees that these statements are entirely authentic; the people express their full conviction. But in order to draw from them a decisive conclusion as to the tangible reality of the occurrences, it would first have to be determined whether what they report as having followed the Sabbath actually happened in such objective reality, or whether they did not experience it only in vision, perhaps in a lesser degree of the same. Thus, after everything is carefully considered, among the facts adduced for bodily excursions there is not a single one that has been clearly and incontrovertibly established as proof of what it purports to prove. Only a few related cases: for example, where the servant of a woman in Oostbruck, in the reed-swamp, was found with his feet dislocated, whom his wife had thrown down during Ascension; she, being taken in and examined by Judge J. Culemberg of Utrecht, confessed the matter without evasion. This and some similar occurrences seem to indicate that in rare cases, as a consequence of a specific lightness (a levity) occurring in demonic states, just as in ecstatic ones, such sorties may indeed take place. But the circumstance that such things have, on the whole, only rarely occurred among ecstatic persons; and still more, that there is not a single example on record in which a number of them ever assembled together in such a way, for instance to celebrate a communal act of worship; ought to have made contemporaries cautious and to have restrained their judgment: since it is by no means credible that the devil and his prestidigations should be allowed a wider scope than the Lord permits Himself to take. Thus the only generally admissible supposition remaining is that the excursion took place in the vision. Whoever has entered into the state of ecstasy finds himself transferred into a region more interior than that in which he was situated under natural conditions. In the latter case his spiritual inwardness is, throughout the extent of his bodily outwardness, present everywhere; and it accomplishes his will, with more or less freedom, throughout that whole sphere. \[Page 159\]

In the other case another sphere, surrounding that outwardness, is drawn into his domain, and is as it were embodied and subjectivized; and he rules, within this circumference that has fallen to him, as he formerly ruled in his body; if not absolutely, yet with respect to certain powers. If therefore he directs his intention to a certain point which lies within the sphere that has thus newly grown for him, then he will be spiritually present at that place; and since for that he does not need to separate himself from the body in order to get to the spot, because the object rather comes to him, he will also feel this body as present just there, and in spiritual optics all around him everything will appear perfectly as if he had truly gone to the place in person. The body meanwhile remains fixed and petrified at its place; for it has, in its outward relations, become an object, like one among the others that surround the personality.

But with that very thing the awakening of the inner spirituality is purchased; and this now begins, upon the basis of personal and impersonal outwardness, the interplay of higher forces which govern space and are not governed by it. This, as we have seen before, has been the case in many ways in the higher ecstasy, where the spirit, torn away from itself, enters into the inwardness of the Lord. It will happen just the same in demonic ecstasy, where the spirit indeed has been pressed down beneath itself, but in the abyss of the same finds, though negative exponents, in an imitative reproduction of the ascending positives --- which rise one above another upwards, but downwards in the others are reflected not as in their image and likeness, but in the full opposite, the non-image and the un-likeness. In this distorted un-imageness everything that issues from the new relation --- thus being and present-being at a distance --- is now effected. In the higher ecstasy this being is not merely truth; rather, because it occurs in the root of all truth, it is root-truly true, from which all ordinary truth is first derived. Here, however, because it occurs in falsehood, it is in falsehood, but with the full semblance of truth; and because it clings to a concrete reality, it intrudes with all its evidential force. The personality thus altered, or rather depressed, will therefore fancy itself present at the place of its intention, and will be spiritually truly present.

If several such personalities, bound by the same rapport to a ruling centre, are also united in their intentions, for example directed toward the same locality, then they will likewise find themselves transported toward that place; and as the directions of their striving converge on the same point, they will assemble about it in a circle which people are accustomed to call the Sabbath, or also the Synagogue, and which they reach by the outing --- the act of putting oneself out of oneself and of transferring oneself thither. \[Page 160\]

The critical days of the Sabbath are well known to the initiated; they therefore urge one another not to miss the gathering, and are also sometimes admonished by their spirits. In earlier times much is also said of the noise of the procession which, led by its queen, swept past the houses of the laggards and reminded them to join. They anoint themselves when they still require it, or when it pleases them so to do; but those who have attained greater practice need it in no way --- as many examples shown in the arrested, and many witness statements, attest. The ointment was rubbed on the naked body, sometimes also applied to the clothes, which nevertheless appeared no less clean and neat on the Sabbath. Maria d'--- of Handaye had testified against Mariacho de Moleres: when they wished to set out, she had anointed her hands, loins and knees with a thick, greenish water, and the witness then, seizing her, led her away. One sees that each must either have been in that same state of ecstasy, or the anointing itself must already have belonged to her. Occasionally already a very lively desire is sufficient to produce the rapture.

Catharina de Landalde, thirty years old, from the parish of Ustaritz, confessed that when she sat in the evening by the fire such a desire came upon her to go to the Sabbath that she had never felt so violent and irresistible a longing for anything as at that time. She then always went there on foot, without any sleep, dreams, or illusions having been produced in her, nor could any doubt arise in her about the reality of what she had seen. It is readily seen that in her a favourable disposition had been well formed by long practice; only an instantaneous, scarcely perceptible passage through the sleep-state was required, and she awoke inwardly with such clearness of what was seen that, as she with equal swiftness passed into the waking state, the memory of what had been seen, likewise without visible transition, attached itself to the circle of ideas of the new sphere. \[Page 161\]

The going on foot, as it showed itself in her, is moreover the one and first type of outing. Maria de Ralde, twenty-eight years old, confessed that she sometimes, in the company of all her neighbours, went to the Sabbath on foot. They then advanced so swiftly as if they had flown, and in a moment arrived at the place. Each time, when she thus found herself united with her companions, she felt a marvellous contentment; for the devil binds the will of those who have been in the assembly only once or twice so firmly that no other desire or longing easily comes to equal it. Other accounts by such persons, who in this way went to the Sabbath or returned from it leading children by the hand, confirmed this information. They were conscious of all the circumstances of their going, which people they met, whom they called upon; and all together affirmed the full reality and corporality of the perceptions they had experienced. But this was not only the case in the Basque country, but elsewhere as well. The Lotharingian women of Pangra likewise asserted that they always went on foot; only when they came to a body of water did the spirit carry them across. If Satan was present there, he as a rule appears as the guide of the travelling witch-women. He summons them or has them summoned at the appointed hour; those who happen to be asleep are inwardly awakened, and then behold the leader in the form of a horse, ass, ox, pig, poodle or billy-goat, and sometimes of a bird, which takes them upon its back. At times even that is unnecessary; any object to which the vision can attach itself---a stick or broom, a spindle-distaff, a pitchfork, anointed or unanointed---already suffices. Sometimes they imagine themselves winged and skim over wide countries. Sometimes only the crown of the head is anointed; children taken by the armpits must sit in front and are carried in that way. Occasionally several of those bound in closer fellowship mount the same pack-beast, and it then proceeds with the cry: "Up on and nowhere!" into the air; most beloved is it in the smoke of the element which, among all, by its nature rises upward from their hearth; sometimes, however, it also goes from some crossroads to which they repair. If meanwhile rain falls, the cry among the Welsh---"Haut la coude Quillet!"---causes the beast with its tail to shield the carried ones from all wetting. The crowing of the night watch and the early morning messenger is exceedingly hateful to the riders; nothing can be more hostile and vexatious to them than his cry when it rings in the ears of those prepared for the ride. Likewise hostile to them are the ringing of bells, and the utterance of the name "Jesu" likewise breaks the charm. Yet the outing must by no means be regarded as effortless; for those led in it grow so weary as if they had traversed a long, rough road on foot; and Barbara Ragel often had to keep her bed for three days after such a journey, and could not stand on her feet.

#### B. The Sabbath as the Court of the Witchly Retinue

\[Page 162\]

The Sabbath is as a rule held upon the mountain which is visible at the greatest distance round about in the district. There is appointed, there, a desolate heath without access, path or dwelling in the neighbourhood, preferably not far from a lake or running water, as the place of meeting. More spacious must these places be for the larger assemblies; in the Basque country the largest was on Mount Rhune and was called Aquelarre, the billy-goat slope. Closer assemblies are held in narrower and more secret places. Often they are open spaces near towns, by large buildings or churches, near the main gate, opposite the high altar when the church is built in the centre. Sometimes they are solitary churches and chapels, in the neighbourhood of which the meeting is held; sometimes even within them, as in the Blessed Spirit Chapel on the Rhune, or in the church of Dordach according to judicial testimony. Sometimes they are old masonry, the ruins of fallen castles scattered on the heights; remote churchyards, or otherwise conspicuous objects, as in the Basque country the so-called Portuguese Chapel at St. Jean de Luz, which serves as a beacon to the ships. A regular order is observed in the selection of all these places. The most private gatherings, at which only the nearest confederates are present, are held in the houses about their centre; often, as the investigation showed, to spite the courts, in the very buildings inhabited by the judges.

Those for whole parishes are celebrated in their vicinity, so that a single parish will often have several; and after the conclusion of one at a given place, the participants will often move on to another in order to begin a second, to which other participants then join themselves. Provincial assemblies for entire provinces are then gathered on prominent mountains, whence comrades assemble from the wide district. (1) The Master of the Chair insists that every comrade remain steadfast to his own fellowship. A girl who lived in St. Pée was, according to the testimony of fifteen witnesses, never seen at the Sabbath there; she had to move over to Sare, the place of her birth. (2)

At times it is some other object which attracts the general attention of an entire region, and then becomes the common point of attraction for the whole neighbourhood. Such is, from Lombard times, the famous walnut-tree of Benevento, around which the bona societas of Italy gathered for their games; and thus many old thunder-oaks will have become sabbath-oaks. One sees that any object, conspicuous enough that the intent of many can be directed toward it, is fit for this purpose; best when it belongs to the church, because the curse is wont to cling to the blessing. Therefore the whole arrangement of the infernal Sabbath is modelled on the ecclesiastical one. Just as the churchly order rises from the household meeting to the brotherhoods in chapels and oratories; just as the populace of a town and district collect into parishes, and these into deaneries, which again are gathered into a bishop's diocese: so is the anti-church society subdivided in the same sequence of stages, united in likewise increasingly prominent meeting-places.

Therefore the times on which these gatherings fall are appointed in the order of the ecclesiastical festival calendar; as the old Bacchic orgies probably submitted to the phases of the moon and their conjunction with the positions of the sun. As the Turks celebrate Friday, the Jews the Sabbath, the Christians the Sunday, so these above all have chosen Thursday; and the Sabbath then falls about midnight, from eleven o'clock until one or two, preferably on stormy nights. Sometimes, however, the night from Friday to Saturday is appointed. So in France; in Castile, according to the statements of those from Logroño, three days---Monday, Wednesday and Friday---are set aside for it. The smaller gatherings, however, are held on almost every night; on Sundays rarely, because it is believed that the sorcery loses its power on that day. Midnight is not, however, absolutely exclusive; the Spaniards already went at nine o'clock in the evening, stayed until midnight, and vanished at the first crowing of the cock. Catharina von Naguille even testified that she had been there at broad daylight, because after a night watch in the church she fell asleep at eleven in the morning. All these small festivities which they held in parishes at individual places they nevertheless call merely "merriments" (esbats), celebrated on the spot. But four times a year, at Easter and at the other great church festivals, the great procession to the Bockshaide is undertaken, in mockery of their service; which, according to the records, was already held in Labourd in the year 1567. (k) The most solemn of all nights, however, was that of St. John the Baptist, about the summer solstice; above all others a night of the greatest dissolution and licentiousness.

Blokula was the name of the place of the Sabbath among the Norse in Mohra and in Elfdale. It was a beautiful pasture; so large that no end of it could be seen. A spacious house had before it a smaller enclosed pasture, to which a large painted gate led; there they let the animals on which they had ridden walk. The human shapes that served for this, however, lay sleeping, leaning against the wall by the door. In a large room of this house stood a long table at which they took their meals. Adjoining this room was another chamber in which stood some finely dressed beds. One sees it is a Swedish country-house, as magnificent as the imagination of simple folk could conceive; elsewhere there is sometimes talk also of gardens and palaces. All those, then, who, directed by their inner intention, meet together in the same space --- just as they, in the exalted sense, behold the whole spatiality, with all its circumstances, rocks and waters and trees, and, on awakening from their rapture, are able to give exact account of all the circumstances --- so they also recognize one another, insofar as they stand in relation to one another. Therefore the reports about the frequency of the Sabbaths all agree in large numbers streaming together there. Even at the festivals of a lower order Katharina Kuffa, from Vellen on the Moselle, counted more than many assembled, and indeed far more women than men. At the larger gatherings it was once estimated --- on the heath of Hunderalse near Handaye --- that the number of those present exceeded 12,000. So many people streamed in from all quarters that one who had been there testified in court that so many had crowded together there as there are stars shining in the sky. Janua von Banno in Lorraine, however, said that, on account of the multitude of those present, it astonished mankind. \[Page 163\]

One sees that demonic vision, as it plunges deeper into the abysses of things, embraces not only great masses of outward objects but also distinguishes them down to the most particular; it is therefore by no means necessarily unclear and confused. More women, however, are present than men; because more of the weaker, more mobile sex, disposed in degeneration toward sensuality and revengefulness, incline to these ways --- for the same reason why, in the Fall, woman fell first. A part of those present appear open and unveiled; others are wrapped in veils and to the rest indistinguishable; as some interpret this, to make the assembled mob believe that there were mighty and rich people in their midst. In truth, however, it is the same symbolic mode of expression that is found with those endowed with the second sight. Those who are only imperfectly in the bond, or who have entered it only with reservation, appear veiled; because the sense is closed to them. The same symbolism also appears in the frequent metamorphoses of form which prevail at the Sabbath. To the inner sense only the innermost in every thing stands and remains; the outward, as the accidental, is subject, in great mobility, to facile change.

Jeannette of Belloc, twenty-four years old, who had been present at the Sabbath since early youth, related: it is there like at a fair. Many walked about in human shapes; others were transformed into dogs, cats, asses, horses, pigs. Yet she added that she had never been able to learn the manner of this transformation, and had only seen all those animals running about there; they could also, at will, make themselves very small, and again as tall as houses.

Jeannette d'Abadie, however, testified how she had been present when this one and that one were transformed into a wolf, a dog, etc.; how they washed their hands in a water which they had kept in a pot with them. They would then at pleasure resume their former shape; and all this not only on the Sabbath, but on the way to it and everywhere. They thereupon vanished so that one saw only a shimmer of them. Both witnesses agreed: there is a constant coming and going; some flew up into the air; others still higher heavenward, while others settled lower down on the land. Some plunged into kindled fires like rockets or lightning; they also went in crowds to do this, and on return related how they had been in Newfoundland within the past two or three hours; how they had sat upon the mast of this or that ship, but could not step aboard because it had been blessed; instead, there they raised a storm in the rigging. They had seen all their own beyond, and which of their relations, who were notoriously in America, had been in their company.

One sees: it is a host encampment of mythical fowl, to which the power of metamorphosis has been given. The Sabbath likewise has its herds and its shepherdly order; those are formed by toads, while boys and young girls make the shepherds who tend them. In the Parsee doctrine they are the devouring kharfesters: snakes, scorpions, and toads, created by Ahriman, the principle of Evil. The shape, kind, and nature of these animals are so fashioned that the disgust with which they fill men appears to him as a warning of a treachery lurking within, which the first two are also completely justified in by the poison they brew. The toad, for its part, since it also seems to possess the entire apparatus for that purpose, has at all times kept suspicion awake against itself. \[Page 164\]

Abbe Rousseau relates in the tenth section of his Remed Secretorum how he had kept one of these animals enclosed in a glass, with the intention of letting it die in its prison, as he had already done with some others. Once, after watching for a while the most strenuous efforts the toad made to get out, it suddenly turned upon him, rose up, swelling itself in an extraordinary way, lifted itself up on its legs to a great height; and then blew, without moving from its place, around itself. The enraged creature looked at him with eyes that, imperceptibly, seemed to become quite red and fiery, so that in that very moment a weakness came over him which made him swoon. A cold sweat ensued, and a flux set in, both of the bowels and of the urine; and his condition was such that his people thought him dead and lost.

The account proves, if not with certainty the physical harmfulness of the animal, at least the injurious effect produced by the deeply rooted belief in its poisonous nature. Thus it will be the most apt symbol in the northern countries to express the inward-closed, poison-swollen, treachery-breeding power of Evil and of witchcraft. Just as doves and other birds, lambs, hares, stags comported themselves tamely toward the saints, so the toad will in particular be the beast of the monsters. It will furnish a suitable ingredient in the poison-kitchen, and appear as the most fitting form into which the witch herself is metamorphosed, or in which the evil spirit hides itself. Therefore the toad has always played a large role in the witchcraft realm. Peter Grey of Toulouse already relates: an unhappy priest from the diocese of Soissons had asked a witch in what manner he might most effectually take revenge on his enemies, and she had advised him: to baptize a toad under the name of John, and then cause it to eat a consecrated host. After that he was to tear it apart, and might prepare from it a poison that would bring death to all his enemies; which indeed happened. The affair was discovered, and she was handed over to the flames. That took place in the year 1460. Therefore it is these creatures that form the flock of the Sabbath. There they are herded by children at a brook, to whom a white rod is given for the purpose. The animals are clothed in red or white velvet, have a small bell at the neck, and sometimes on the feet; and witnesses testified that they had seen the daughter of the Lady of Martibelsarena dancing at the Sabbath with four such animals; she carried one so clothed on her left shoulder, an unclothed one on the right, and two similar ones on her fists, like a huntsman his hawks. \[Page 165\]

They dance before their masters on the Sabbath, and present their complaints when they have not been well kept. That is the idyll of the Sabbath; they are the little lambs of the local Pegnitz-shepherds. "I too have been in Arcadia," his initiates can attest; and naive innocence still maintains, in the midst of a debauched life, its right, lavishing all its tenderness on the most unlovely of all animals. But not only those bound together in the same principle recognize one another in the vision, and all that in nature belongs to their circle; they also peer into the realms of spirits, to whose powers they are attached, and the depths of those realms are opened to their exalted eye.

Yet this glance into its home is not granted to the evil eye alone; the good eye is likewise not denied sight of the regions where ruin has taken up its dwelling; and we shall do well, with it, first to inquire what it beholds of them and of their circles, before we allow the demonic apparitions to pass over us. Herbert, a contemporary of St. Bernard --- round whom a whole world of visions disclosed itself --- tells us something like this of a friend of his youth, the hermit Dominicus. He had formerly lived in the Cistercian monastery Carrezeda near León, and was then dismissed by the abbot into solitude, dwelling near that city in a mountain cave, practising the strictest continence; almost shut off from all intercourse with the world, devoting himself to contemplation; burning with love of God, and in a wonderful way endowed with the gift of tears.

Once he sat at the entrance of his cave, his gaze turned toward heaven, attentively following the light of a sunbeam to its source. Suddenly he perceived the shape of a burning dragon, which, descending in that very ray, in a violent plunge threw itself toward his face as if to devour it. Terrified by the apparition, he crouched inward; called on the Lord, and made the sign of the cross against the assailant. Driven off, it was yet able to do nothing against him, but it flew constantly about him and would not leave him. He then shut his eyes and covered his face with his garments; but that availed him nothing, for he saw the figure with closed eyelids as though with them open; and this penetrating, subtle being could not be repelled by clothing. When he saw, therefore, that he could not escape the sight, he opened his eyes again, and let them behold that whose attack he could not prevent. Then other demons likewise came to light in serpent form and other animal shapes, in hordes, and filled the dwelling from top to bottom.

Among them there was so great a diversity of dimensions, such variation in their properties, and such ugliness in their forms that it cannot be described, and many of them were fire-colored. They swarmed about him like bees, flared up like fire in a thorn-bush, dashing at him with angry movements and attacking him with blows. But although they appeared fiery, they by no means had the power to burn. For though they flew around him in a circle, and, sweeping past him at the swiftest speed, often struck his face, they did indeed press upon him in every way, but never harmed him with fire. When he then again went out somewhat before the door, to breathe somewhat from the oppression; there also appeared to him whole heaps of demons, in great swarms traversing the air, and filling everything from the earth to the heaven. These too were so manifoldly graded, so terrible through their extraordinary appearance, so gruesome through their ugliness: that human senses could not endure such a confluence of monsters, had not the power of Heaven assisted them. \[Page 166\]

He shared with me at that time the observation: these impure spirits had not laid aside the spiritual forms in which they always appeared to him in the air before the sign of the cross; but rather those into which they had fantastically transformed themselves. From then on, until the day of writing it down, the man of God saw these visions daily while awake; both in daylight and in the nocturnal darkness, with closed eyes just as with open. But the terror and the distress which he had at first entirely vanished; so that in the end he made no more of them than if they were flies or other vermin. For the light-spirits also visited him, and filled him with their consolations; however, about their forms he never, out of discretion, spoke to me.

These perceptions found themselves confirmed by others, from a monk of Clairvaux, whom Herbert does not name, because he was still alive at the time; who however had spent 40 years there in all holiness, and among other gifts also had such a lively inner eye: that with it, at a dying fellow brother, he saw the soul going out like a smoke from the censer, which then, when it had fully risen, remained hovering for a time in a round-clumped little cloud, transparent and about the size of a bushel, four to five ells above the corpse; until the brothers who had hurried there completed the funeral rites.

This one now, as often as he looked up into the air with a sharper gaze, likewise beheld, with his bodily eyes, in broad daylight swarms of demons roaming everywhere; in such numbers that their count could not be estimated. They appeared in manifold forms; one of these misshapen ones however was predominant. According to their bodily outlines they seemed to be monstrous men, of giant stature, black as Moors, nimble as serpents, wild as lions. They had thick heads, misshapen bellies, and were besides crooked and hunchbacked, with long and thin necks; while arms and legs likewise stretched themselves beyond all measure in length. When they halted somewhere in the air, then he could distinctly distinguish their forms, limb by limb; but if they roamed about in it with agile movement, then he saw nothing of them but mere larval shadows and tangles of whirlwinds.

On bright days, when the sun in its full power shines through the airs, then he was accustomed to see these visions the best, and to distinguish them the most clearly. When however he once also spent deep into the night in prayer, suddenly the hairs of his body began, in night terror, to bristle; and he saw masses of these demons crowding through the doors, and filling the whole house; so that piled up everywhere, they struck at the one praying. He made use of the sign of the cross and the angelic salutation, and thereby drove all the boisterous guests out of his oratory. In the following night he heard them again striking violently against the wall; and when he looked up, he saw in the window One, winged like a griffin or ostrich, standing, threatening him with its assault, which he however drove away in the same manner.

These views of spiritually sensitive men are presented here, as one easily recognizes, with the same fidelity, simplicity, and the same color and physiognomy of truthfulness, as the reports of a naturalist who has perhaps sharpened his senses through an especially light-strong microscope; and now recounts to us his observations made on the winged infusoria of the air, which he has discovered. One does not see why one should grant belief only to his report alone, and not also make the others the object of closer investigation; since nothing stands in the way except the unusualness of the matter. \[Page 167\]

Those now who have seen these appearances had their intention originally not directed toward them; it was much more turned away from them by them; they had with all the power of their will armed from Above opposed themselves to the approaching ones, and so they had had to seize flight before them. But the demonic ones have now sunk this their intention entirely into them; they are devoted to them with all their affects, and lure them toward themselves. Before these, therefore, they do not flee; they, winged as they are, carry off the ones sunk into them well themselves with them, lending them their own wings, to those nodal points on earth where the demonic entwines itself with the natural, and in the meshes of the great net the threads of the one cross through those of the other.

This out come in the spirit, it is the sally forth; the place to which it goes is the site of the Sabbath: that nodal point which the fleeing shadows circle, where the settling, permanent ones have already chosen their seat. To them the ones striving into this realm are led by those messengers, and admitted to the community of the settlers. Their companionship they will now likewise behold in the spirit; according to the measure of the type which appears implanted in human nature, and in whose forms it must grasp the ideas offering themselves; the good ones in beautiful, inner harmony, the fallen ones in distortion and in dissonance. Let us see what the judicial testimonies about these types report to us: varying, as is comprehensible, in the apprehension of them, according to the turbidity or clarity of the beholding.

Maria de Ralde, who since her tenth year had visited the Sabbath, but for five years had given up the abomination, testified: she had there seen the Satan for the first time in the form of a tree stump, without feet. He seemed to sit on a chair, with something that looked like a human face, but as if covered with darkness. From there downward she saw him more clearly, in the form of a man, either of red or black color. Usually it is a stone that stands in the middle of the place, on which the one whom they call the Lord or also the Master sits.

Beside that tree-like form, like an old cypress or oak struck by lightning, and dried up from the top downward, it is now especially the form of the goat that he loves to assume. But if he appears in human form, then he presents himself in the form of a tall, black man, red and flaming like a fire that bursts from the oven, whose forms appear only halfway; with a broken, inarticulate, but commanding, noisy and terrible voice; often done in such a way that it is hard to distinguish whether it is man, animal, or tree trunk. He sits in a chair, apparently gilded, but glowing; the queen of the Sabbath, whom he has taken for himself from the initiates, in all splendor and glory at his side. Everything around, persons and things, appears in a false nothing; all forms in the enormous, gigantic or dwarfed and shifted. Jeanette d'Abadie saw him with six, sometimes eight horns, a long tail, and a double face. Sometimes there are two of them present: a Grand Master Leonard, and a smaller one, whom the Basques called Master Jean Mullin, and whom the former, in his absence, substituted in his place. \[Page 168\]

The prisoners from Logroño saw him sitting on a black chair, so terrible and abominable that it cannot be described. He had a crown of black horns, among which three were very large, like those of a goat, the others smaller; two at the neck, one on the forehead, which illuminated the entire Sabbath with a light stronger than that of the moon, weaker than sunlight. His hair was disheveled, his face is pale and distorted. He has round, large, wide-open eyes, glowing with it and terrible to behold; a goatee beard, the form of the neck and the rest of the body ill-shaped, half human, half goat; hands and feet shaped humanly; the fingers of the hands all of equal length, tapering to a point and clawed; the feet like goose feet, with a donkey's tail besides. On the Sabbath he appears under a kind of throne canopy, of poor cloth, but fitted out in strange forms. His voice is terrible, but without resonance; when he speaks, it is as if a mule were braying; his tone inarticulate, biting and hard to understand. He maintains, however, always great gravity and haughtiness, combined with the bearing of a melancholic person who is always bored.

One sees that our poets, who in recent times have greatly endeavored to depict for us the personality of the King of the nocturnal realms, have devised nothing more striking in form and bearing than these women from the common folk have beheld. There must well be a ground of truth underlying their visions on both sides, which they have only further elaborated; and which then again other youths strive to express as mimetically as possible in their bearing. Beside this Master, however, there are still many other demons of every order present in the lodge; and indeed, as one who belonged to the higher ones testified, more in number than humans. They undertake manifold tasks, set the tables, procure all necessities, consort with men and women as succubi and incubi, serve as cupbearers, assist at the sacrifice, transform themselves into animals, manage the musical exercises at the Sabbath, and as attendants are often assigned to the women in the form of toads. Many of the latter had closely observed these their spirits, and said of them: they had a dark, black face, deep eyes sparkling like flames; a wide, deep, always foul-smelling maw, exhaling like a sulfurous vapor; rough, hairy hands with sharp claws; feet with cloven hooves, and in their shape always without proportion, either too small or too large, and otherwise without all measure.

Aleria Belhora of Blamweiler saw them sometimes without a head, sometimes with only one foot. These spirits, although according to another account they know many languages, yet always speak in the vernacular; and from it are also taken the names which they bear: Misfortune, Torment, Featherbrush etc. in German; among the Romance speakers, however: maistre persil, Solybois, Verdelet, Sautebuisson. But their voice too has something artificially made about it; three witnesses compared it to a sound coming forth from a barrel or a broken pot, small, soft, lisping. They are at the beginning quite kind and pious, and accustom one well to the like. To Mallot his one advises: to abstain from gluttony, unchastity and every wrong; he should always keep God before his eyes, give alms, fast twice a week, and not forget his daily prayer.

These figures are true goiters, begotten by the spirit as incubus with these women. He has impregnated her inner sense, and the female nature has then surrendered the material for the development of the germ; and since evil and falsehood can only incorporate themselves in disharmony, disproportion, distortion of all relations; so these acephalous beings, monstrosities, elves and evil things have emerged, in the sharpest consequential justice of the visionary formative nature.

#### C. The Homage Paid to the Master and the Round Dance Around Him

\[Page 169\]

If the Sabbath in the relation first described was a cookshop of the evil principle and the Venus mountain, whither the inflamed life pressed to enter as a guest with the food master, and to intoxicate itself in lust from his beaker; then the scene now passes over into the throne room of the imperial palace. The emperor, or his plenipotentiary, sits crowned on a golden seat, the chosen empress at his side; and the estates of the realm appear, to present their homage and to obtain investiture. But here the contradiction that lies in the whole relation steps forth most glaringly, and manifests itself in the sharpest irony. On the throne sits a goat or a goatish figure; for the inner essence will not and cannot hide itself. Just as the good fragrance in such an atmosphere yields place to the stench, so every beauty to ugliness. Where the immoderate holds sway, there can be no question of measured bearing, dignity and majesty; the opposite of all that is therefore demanded there by the circumstances. The homage will thus also be, in its forms, a sarcastic parody of all submission to the higher; nevertheless, it will express the surrender into the blindest servitude. The act of homage is fulfilled as the homage-payers kiss the posterior and anterior parts of the goat.

The face of man is held upright, his eye drinks in the light, his ear the sound-ether; while his mouth inhales the air, and in the exhaled air inscribes the thought in the word. Extremely characteristic is it that the goat-figure of the evil spirit is assigned a second face, turned downward; initiated into the night-realms of the depths; closely connected with all the excretory organs that open downward, and with all the paths through which life purifies itself in the refuse. On the middle of this face the kiss is pressed; and the kisser thereby pledges himself to eternal servitude under the absolutism of evil.

All who newly enter the circle---whether as children introduced into it by their mothers and relatives; whether already grown and led up for the first time by an earlier initiate---must begin by performing this homage. It repeats itself with all of them in every great celebration, which opens with this hand-kiss and only admits the most intimate to the kiss of the mouth. Every one who enters approaches the chair with fear and trembling, falls at the master's feet, and embraces his hips with humility; or all kneel before him with their backs turned to him, hands clasped together behind, and remain in this position until he bids them rise.

All who have performed the homage in such a manner have unanimously confessed: that once they have surrendered themselves to the devil, there is no more separation from him, and that their apostasy is punished with severe penalty; wherefore none of them ever dares to escape his tyranny. He indeed promises in all things the opposite of the Sermon on the Mount of the Savior: riches to the poor, joy to the sorrowful, power to the weak, beauty to the ugly, knowledge to the ignorant. But---and herein the falsehood of the matter steps forth most sharply---experience shows that there is nothing more wretched, more comfortless, more hateful, more ignorant, more tormented than those who have thus given themselves into his servitude. Never has one of them become more beautiful than she was before, or more insightful and lovable. \[Page 170\]

The money that he gives is an ideal one; it has validity only in the inner world; it is not even paper money, only a fabricated golden shimmer, like a will-o'-the-wisp hovering around a rotting plant, a moss, a shard, which in the real world immediately fades and vanishes. Not always does it seem permitted to them, on the other hand, to close their spiritual balance in the same coin; for there are some among them appointed to collect the penalties; who, for common or personal advantage---as is evident from the records---also exact them with sober courage. The rich in general buy off their offenses with an ox or a sheep, which is then offered up in the form of a sacrifice. Thus Desiderius Foucant, at St. Deodat, annually during the dog days on Mount Hupella in the Vosges, offered something of the sort to his spirit, though it had to be black. The poor give young chickens; some also their hair, small birds, money made of leather; and if they have nothing at all, then perhaps a straw, or whatever else the spirit provides; it is then already enough if they only willingly submit themselves to the Fendallasten. If one refuses, then it is scolded and beaten, falls into weakness, its children die, and its livelihood fails.

It is a common complaint that the Master always seeks pretexts to punish them mercilessly for disobedience or other faults; so that no peace is ever to be found with him. One is beaten to the point of death because he appeared late or not at all at the assembly. Another is kept suspended over the Moselle for so long, and threatened with drowning, until he promises that he will bewitch and kill another. Others must atone with severe strokes because they have caused no harm; often so harshly that they can scarcely breathe; for the disciplinarian has iron hands. At times they are scratched, of which Rosa Gerardina showed the marks. Often they are struck with illness; one must ruin her own livestock because she spared others; indeed, a third must carry out the imposed task---since she cannot execute it on the neighbor---on her own ten-year-old daughter. For that is their law and their way; and if several have drawn his retribution upon themselves, then the lot decides between them. Everywhere, therefore, the harshest and most burdensome servitude; and in this realm of the imagination, as they now customarily call it, the ironclad consequence reigns with oppressive tyranny. Therefore a woman from Biarritz, in the Basque country, forty years old, let herself out in streams of tears before the judges concerning the Sabbath: those are to be deemed fortunate who have never seen the Sabbath, or wished to see it, and who have never beheld with their eyes the Lou Peccat, as she called the Devil in Gascon. \[Page 171\]

He who binds himself to the Lord seeks to escape the dominion of fatality, whose tyranny has entered into him through sin, so that he may regain the freedom of the children of God. But he who holds to evil must stake the freedom that has still remained to him from that fall; and to the fatality that previously had only partially bound him in its chains, he will now entirely fall into serfdom. The realm of the Sabbath is therefore a realm of the most unlimited and absolute despotism, in a scope such as even the Orient does not know; more so even than the realm of Nimrod, the great hunter from the land of the Cushites. The well-ordered state seeks, through the power of the united good in men, to curb and master the evil that dwells in them; but this state, fashioned in the image and likeness of Hell, unites the evil in the bond of its center, in order thereby to bind and suppress the good; so that it is tolerated at most only as a means to lead to an evil end.

From a semblance of the freedom of the companions can therefore never be spoken in it; they must blindly surrender themselves to the perverse ruling will as tools; and this one, armed with them, rules and governs in this armament according to its pleasure. The despot on the throne is therefore the unconditional lord over the body and soul of his servants. Of both sexes, as evil is, the entire companionship of the Sabbath fills his harem, and he has set his favorites in it as kings and queens of the day; his chancellor with the staff watches over the order of the assembly; all the forces of the assembled are reined and bridled to him, and he directs them like the rider the horse that he has mounted. As now the heavenly bodies, one higher than the other, all however ultimately obey gravity; as the spirits of evil, opposite those of the good, stand ordered in their hierarchies; so it is also in the arrangement of the children of the night on their Mayfields.

The number nine rules in these hierarchies, and so it will also be the ruling one in these assemblies. Johannes de Vaulr von Stablo, questioned in his interrogations about how many lodges there were in the vicinity, named nine of them: Stablo, Hufalise, Trer, Tasgine, Cher, Malmedy, Salm, Valle; each had again designated various places where they might assemble; Stablo had four of them, among which Croeff on the Mosel belonged. All are subordinate to one another, like the hierarchies, from whose midst spirits preside over them; but the highest is the main lodge, and with it the council days are held, in the assembly of all superiors, and the resolved is then communicated to the others.

Just as this locally limited number of nine seems again to be a subordinate member of a higher number of nine, since de Vaulr also speaks of a further assembly at Utrecht, where he often went; so downward from the bodies of each individual assembly is again divided according to another number, which seems to be the number three. Three tables are accordingly at every Sabbath: at the first sit those who are called by de Vaulr *les brarsz hommes*, with their wives. They are the actual sorcerers and sorceresses, twelve in number, under the presidency of the directing spirit with two associates. At the second table find the initiates of the second order their place, who occupy themselves with maleficia; while at the third the novices assemble, who are occupied with the household of the Sabbath; and because they thereby come into frequent contact with children and the uninitiated, in order not to be betrayed, they go masked. \[Page 172\]

All sit in the order of their initiation at the tables; only those meritorious for the purposes of the society are promoted to higher rank. In the same order they possess power to do evil, honor and are honored. In Spain it was more the number twelve that ruled there; Pampelona was the main lodge, Barrabon its superior. There the initiates came with their masters from twelve Sabbaths in the round together, and threw themselves down before the grand master; on the homeward journey the air was entirely filled with the flying ones.

In the same principle the times were also divided, according to the order of the abominations to be practiced in them. On Sundays, according to some accounts, the orgies of unnatural lusts were held; on Thursday and Saturday those of bestiality and sodomy; on Wednesday and Friday those of blasphemy and the works for the satisfaction of revenge; Monday and Tuesday the Sabbaths of ordinary lusts. In nature the dominion expresses itself in the movement that it effects in the subjugated through the forces at its disposal. Thus the power of the sun can be recognized, in which she moves the wandering stars around herself. Among men one can easily discern the field commander's order of power in the tactical movements of the army; and the ancient war dances have turned the seriousness of these evolutions into aesthetic play; and the commanding word, spread out into song and music, directs all movements therein, interpreting them and circumscribing them with the rhythm.

Just so has the natural drive, in the relation of the sexes, by multiplying and regulating the movements, brought forth the moriscos, the fandango, the sarabands, and similar dances. The evil drive in man, when it has found its master and surrendered itself to his service, is now also driven by him in certain lines of movements, which, when brought into the form of a dance, symbolically represent the alternating relation of dominance and submissiveness. In these dances the Lord of the Sabbath will be the ring leader; around him as the center all the whirlings will move, and because the circle appears as the line of the strictest subordination, therefore they will most gladly be turned into roundness; but the center will enclose the formula and the word of all these circlings within itself. But because evil has no harmony in itself, therefore there will also be only dissonance in the music of this word; the song and the shouting, and the instrumental clamor will, according to the accounts of eyewitnesses, sound so repugnant and confused. One blows on a stick, as on a transverse flute; another treats a dead horse's skull like a zither; yet another strikes with a club against the oak tree, so that it sounds like drums and army kettledrums. A blind man, sitting on a two-branched tree, lets a tambourine resound; castanets are again handled by others; violins cut through the noise with sharp tones, and the spirits mix in their hoarse, hollow voices like muffled trumpets: Everything calls, rustles, roars, and howls wildly together; and the desolate clamor sounds like the charivari of the Sybarites at Athenaeus, when each one, unconcerned about the other, sings his own song. And after all the displeasure that those present may perhaps feel, they must still thank the spirit for the splendid music; and whoever resists wins only blows from it. \[Page 173\]

The dance is in its kind just as much the reverse of the usual dance order, precisely because it is meant to express a fundamentally inverted relation. In the center sits the master, if he does not himself join in, seriously on his chair, from time to time humming inarticulate tones. The companions then in the round, naked or also in their shirts, turning their backsides to him; each with her demon at her side, all grasping each other with hands laid on their backs, and now under the most obscene movements always turning to the left.

According to the statements of the initiates, there are three kinds of these dances. One in the manner of the gypsies, who are frequently found in the Labourd, the borderland of France and Spain. The second is in the manner of the peasants with jumps; but just like the previous one going in a circle. In the third the dancers are lined up in a straight line, but man and woman turned with their backs to each other; and now, as they move toward each other and away from each other, colliding together in a brutal manner in certain cadences. Sometimes, however, they are also positioned in such a way that alternately one faces outward, the other toward the center, and they now thus begin the round dance.

One sees that, through the turning of the back, the usual order of the dimensions is reversed; because what was below has become above, the rear side is also declared to be the front; and thus the left must also count as the side of honor. The commissaries in the Basque country attributed the backward-bent posture of the girls there to their frequent attendance at the Sabbath. But Prieras lets himself be heard thus concerning those in northern Italy: "Often boys and girls of 8--10--14 years convert there, upon the exhortations and persuasions of the inquisitors; who then, on account of the strangeness of the matter, are sometimes even bidden to perform the dances as they are customary at the Sabbath.

They carry it out, and prove that they possess a superhuman art therein. These dances differ from human ones in that the girl holds herself behind the man's back, and jumps not forward, but backward while going backward. At the end, when a bow is made to the presiding demon, they incline---always turning their backs to him---the head not forward, but backward; and they bend the foot likewise not backward, but forward, lifting it high. But all this is executed with such grace and charm that it cannot possibly be learned in a short time and at a young age. Whoever doubts these statements can easily convince himself by ocular proof in the region of Como or Brescia; even here in Rome through the testimony of Brother J. B. de Biqueria, prior of Briren, and others. It would be desirable that one of the venerable cardinals might have 10--12 of these boys and girls brought to Rome; to give the city this spectacle, and to draw the veil of unbelief from the eyes of many."

This demonic St. Vitus dance is now called the pavana among those in Belgium; and the earth where it has been danced is struck with the curse that it shall no longer grow green henceforth. In its course, songs are sung in crude melodies and obscene content; from time to time interrupted with exclamations, such as, for example, those from Logny cried: Har! Har! Devil! Devil! Jump here, jump there! Play there, play here! while meanwhile the others in the chorus called Sabbath! Sabbath! So that everything may show itself in proper contrast to the usual course of the world, the lame, the limping, the old cripples and the infirm must likewise be present, who then display themselves in the dance with the greatest ease and nimbleness. \[Page 174\]

After such a dance, the company doubtless also amuses itself in the tumbling school. Maria de la Parque of Handaye, aged 19--20 years, and several others with her testified: when they had been at the Sabbath one night, Domingina Maletena, up on the mountain of La Rhune, which stands high and broad on the border of three kingdoms, Navarre, France, and Spain, had entered into a wager with another whose name they mentioned to us, as to who could perform the most beautiful jump, and she had thereupon jumped down from the summit of the mountain to the sandy stretch between Handaye and Fontarrabie. That was nearly two hours' journey, and the other could not match her; she came only as far as the gate of one of the inhabitants of Handaye. They all assured: they had seen it quite clearly; they had gone down to them when the Sabbath was ending, and Domingina had waited for them to receive the prize of the wager. These are jumps such as the Indian ape Hanuman was wont to perform; and they cannot surprise us in such ones, who transport themselves from afar to any distance in a short space of time. But the unembarrassed quality in the testimony speaks for the certainty that the vivid plasticity of the vision affords. \[Page 175\]

The question arises: whether such a round dance, formed in the spirit of a distant community and submitted to its modulation, might also be seen by one who possesses the second sight? The following case, which Remy recounts, appears to decide the question affirmatively. When Nicolaa Laghernhard from the Garminger Mill went to Assencauria in August 1590, and was walking along the edge of a forest at bright midday, she saw in the adjacent field a circle of dancing men and women who, however, turned their backs to her. When she looked more closely, she noticed among the dancers some interspersed whose feet appeared to her shaped like goat feet. Half-dead with fright, she called out the name of Jesus and prayed that she might return safely and unharmed to her home. In an instant, all the dancers vanished, with one exception: Peter Grospetter by name, who also quickly ascended into the air, but in the ascent let fall a baker's brush, with which bakers are accustomed to clean the oven before inserting the bread. She herself was likewise seized by a violent gust of wind, so that she could scarcely draw breath; and when she arrived home, she lay sick in bed for three days. The talk spread quickly among the people from her relatives; and Peter, so as not to give the appearance of confirming the truth of the story through his silence, lodged a vehement complaint about it with the judge---but then let it drop, in order not to expose himself through the trial to greater prolixities and dangers. This increased the suspicion against him, as it was attributed to a bad conscience. The judge therefore inquired all the more earnestly into the life he led and his morals; and since he found sufficient cause, he had him arrested and brought him to a confession that was not entirely unwilling, as well as to the naming of those who had been with him. Among these were Barbel, the wife of Johann the stonemason from Dusa, and Mazetta, the wife of Lorenz from the same place, who in February and March 1591 confirmed his statements about the Sabbath and the spirits rubbed into the dance. To their testimony was now added another confirmation. Michael, the herdsman from Dusa, testified: he had been present at the affair as a piper, in that he had placed a round shepherd's staff to his mouth and fingered it around as if on a pipe. But when that Nicolaa, trembling, had called out "Jesus!" and thereby signed herself with the cross, he had fallen down from the high branch of the oak on which he had been sitting, and then been seized by the whirlwind and carried to the meadow where he had just before been tending the herd. For further confirmation of these statements, the place where the round dance had been performed was found trampled, as in a riding school where the horses go; but interspersed were traces of goat and cattle feet. These remained visible even when, in the following autumn, the plot was plowed under. Testimony was given by Nickel Klein, Desiderius Verner, and Gaspar the tailor, who were questioned about it by the judge. \[Page 176\]

The visiting of the Sabbath becomes, for those who have once taken a liking to it, like opium-eating in the Orient, a passion of which they can scarcely gain mastery. Johanna Dibasson, aged 25 years, said: the Sabbath is a true paradise, and there are more joys there than can be expressed. All who visit it find the time so short amid sheer lust and pleasure that they part from it only with regret and always feel a longing within themselves to return to it. Maria de la Ralde, a very beautiful woman who otherwise had not visited it for five years, likewise spoke of the yearning that had driven her there; so that, when she had been called to it, it had felt to her as if she were to go to a wedding.

It was not due to the freedom and licentiousness enjoyed there, as she herself stated that she had never seen whoring or fornication there; but because the spirit binds her heart and will in such a way that it allows scarcely any other desire. Furthermore, the companions held the Sabbath to be a place where a hundred thousand wondrous and unheard-of things can be seen, and so many various, melody-rich instruments can be heard, that they believe themselves enchanted as if in an earthly paradise. 1)

At court they often questioned her: what attraction the Sabbath could possibly hold for her, since even merely hearing of its abominations and its filth makes the skin shudder? But she replied without concealment: they hear and see all these abominations with a wondrous lust and a raving desire to be present at them; the interval from day to night, when they could set out on the journey, seems to her all too long; the hours until then creep by for them with unbearable slowness, but there, in the enjoyment of so many delights, they pass with all too swift haste. All the abominations, all the terrors and shadows pass by so lightning-like quickly, and vanish so suddenly, that no displeasure or pain finds time to master their soul or body. Thus nothing remains behind but the feeling of astonishment at so much that is new pressing in upon them, satisfying their curiosity, and satiating all their desires, whether of amorous or vengeful kind. These are truly joys beyond human nature, and not of Jewish origin! 7

### Chapter 3. Personal States of the Spiritual Man in the Lord and in Sorcery

If Satan on the first stage has been host and steward, on the second king and unconditional ruler; then on the third he stands as God, whom they worship, opposite the companions, and these will form his church around him. Doubt has initiated the apostasy, sensuality has served as motive for the will; thus he has given his assent, and the perverted faith, which has taken root in the spirit in place of doubt, now holds him fast in the chosen decision. Once the demonic church of the night has thus first formed itself, through the free self-determination of its members; then it maintains and increases itself in the same way as the church of light, through the reception of the offspring of those who have joined. The children who are born in the bond, as well as others whom the companions seize, are offered to their God; so that he may receive them into his religion through a kind of baptism. \[Page 177\]

A certain rite is required for this, and definite formulas in which the reception takes place; and the judicial statements have by no means left us in the dark about this either. Those from Castile reported the following on the matter: When the assembly is together on the Prado del Cabron, the goat meadow; then the women offer these children to the Master while kneeling, with the words: Great mighty Lord! whom I worship, I bring you this new servant, who wishes to be your slave forever! The Master from his chair, as a sign of thanks and satisfaction, replies: Come closer to me! They now obeying, slide forward on their knees to him, and offer him the child, which he then takes on his arm and gives back to the one offering it, thanks her, and simultaneously admonishes her: Take care to nurture his youth, because his kingdom will thereby be increased. --- The mothers hasten more to offer their children on the Sabbath of reception than in the house of God; the time seems otherwise to depend on them, and mostly the second or third year is chosen. Until the ninth, they now guard the host of the Sabbath, and are only permitted to behold its wonders from afar.

Since the forcibly abducted can only be admitted with their free consent, there are arrangements there to extort this from them; deep abysses, for example, as in the trials of the Freemasons, into which they make as if to throw them if they resist denying God. Moreover, the women are beaten and scourged if they bring no children; that they, for the sake of peace, fetch them from other villages and regions; so that some in Mohra brought 15--16 children with them every night to the Sabbath. The children from Eüfdal knew much to say: of a white angel who forbade them to carry out what the devil had assigned them to do, and said thereby: the mischief shall not be overlooked much longer. On account of the base, dissolute life of the people, the matter had been tolerated hitherto; but now everything must be revealed. This angel had sometimes also placed himself in the doorway, between the malefactors and the children; and when they had come not far from Blokula, he had taken the children back, but the women had then gone in.

The Castilians now continue: "If the children, after they have reached the ninth year, unfortunately, without being compelled thereto by force from one of the companions, have surrendered themselves to the devil; then they throw themselves down before him on the earth. He, with fire flashing from his eyes, says to them: What do you desire, do you wish to become one of mine? He answers: Yes! Thereupon the other: Do you come with your full resolve of will? Answer again: Yes! Then will and do what I will and do! Thereupon the Queen of the Sabbath, who leads up the neophyte, says to him: Then speak after me with a loud voice: 'I deny God first, then Jesus Christ, his Son, the Holy Ghost, the Virgin, the Saints, the holy Cross, the Chrism, the Baptism and the faith that I have hitherto held, my godparents, and I deliver myself up in all things to your power, and into your hands; I acknowledge no other God, so that you are my God, and I your servant.'?" \[Page 178\]

Then a toad is handed over to him in its full state, and the master commands him to worship it; and now the usual homage is rendered on the knees with the kissing. Then the baptism is scratched off for him with the claws of the left hand on the forehead, and in its place the stigmatization is applied with a false gold needle in the white of the left eye, or also elsewhere; which thus stands here equivalent to the circumcision in the old covenant. The pains that this operation arouses are allayed in particularly favored ones by a herb that the master gives them. The oral promise is sometimes repeated in writing later on. The vow that Gaufredy had made read, according to the records of his trial, as follows: Je Louis Gaufredy renonce à tous les biens, tant spirituels que corporels, qui me pourroyent estre conferé de la part de Dieu, de la vierge Marie ei de tous les saincis de Paradis, pareillement de mon Patron S. Jean Baptiste, s. Pierre, s. Paul, s. Fran- cois, et de me donner de corps et d'ame à Lucifer iey present arec tous les biens, que je ferais à jamais: excepté la valeur du sacrament pour le regard de ceux qui le re- cevront. Ei ainsi le signe et atteste. The demon on his side now promised him: by the power of his oath he should inflame all girls and women whom he wished to possess with love, if the breath reached their nose. Ordinary heat of desire in this world, and still greater joy in that life.

This happens, however, only after they have renewed the vassal oath: to remain forever faithful to their new lord, never to return to Christianity, to attend the Sabbath regularly, to offer worship there, and to increase and extend the kingdom and the church by bringing in others. To the newly admitted ones there is then also given, probably as a mockery of the Christian baptism, a new one, in a special font filled with filth, under various ridiculous ceremonies. Instead of the old godfathers, new ones are assigned to them, who serve as sureties for the new faith. Instead of the old name, a new one is bestowed upon them, taken from the places where they were born, or from other accidental circumstances. Thus Cuno of Rohren on the Moselle was called Barbicapa in this rebaptism, others again differently. They vow at the same time: never to go to the Eucharist; or, if they do so, only with the intention of approaching the sacrament in order to misuse it. They promise: to dishonor and revile Mary and all the saints, by word and by deed; to trample and spit upon their relics; to abstain from the sign of the cross, and, where it may perchance be found molded in plastic form, to break and destroy it; likewise to avoid all sacramentals of the holy water, of the consecrated salt, the candles; never to confess their sins; to cover their relation to the demon and the secret of the Sabbath with silence; and to dedicate all their powers and possessions to their new lord, who is ever present to them, alone fulfills all their desires, and after death can make them blessed. \[Page 179\]

With the confirmation it is done later in the same way as before with the baptism, and new sponsors are also assigned to them for it. They then vow sacrifices, in order thereby to render divine honor to the lord. Some offer themselves to sacrifice a child every month. Others bind themselves to bring such a one every year, and to redeem the omitted performances with penances. As payment therefor, a piece of their clothing is given to the demon; for the spirit of darkness seeks to procure for himself a part of everything: from the spiritual goods the faith and the baptism, from the bodily blood, from the natural gifts the children, and from the goods of fortune this part of the clothing. Upon all this an oath is now also probably sworn; a circle is inscribed in the ground, the master seats himself in its center, and the oath-taker outside promises him that he will faithfully perform all this. The circle is the symbol of the deity and its dominion over all things, but the earth is the footstool of God: and through the symbolic oath-swearing it shall be expressed: that the recipient of the promise is the lord of heaven and earth, and is acknowledged as such by his faithful ones.

Now follows the request: to strike the petitioner out of the book of life, and in exchange to inscribe him in the book of death. This is done, and they now show themselves transformed in their whole nature; and the women become, to use the expressions of the Compendium Maleficarum: (allaces, proditiosae, loquaces, garrulosae, tenaces, glutinosae, ardentes et luxuriosae, leeres, rebelles et litigosae, nocivae et periculosae, comparantur Ursis, Vento, Scorpioni, Leoni, Draconi et laqueo. 1) Almost with the same words the above-cited matter is repeated in the judgment that the Inquisition of Avignon in 1592 pronounced over a number of the accused: Quod vos et vestrum quilibet Deum nostrum, omnium creatorem et opificem, unum et trinum abnegastis, et Imm.

You have worshipped the Devil, the ancient enemy of the human race, and devoted yourselves to him perpetually; and, renouncing the most sacred baptism, and those who were your sponsors therein, lifting up and repudiating them, and your portion of paradise, and the eternal inheritance which our Lord Jesus Christ acquired for you and the whole human race by His death, in the presence of the aforesaid Cacodaemon, appearing in human form, you renounced: pouring over you anew the water, which you received, with the Devil himself roaring as he did so, but with your name changed, and the sacred name imposed upon you in baptism now altered, so that another fictitious name might be imposed upon you in this fictitious baptism; and you did so, and received it: and as a pledge of faith given to the Demon, you gave him a fragment of your garments and a particle thereof; and that the father of lies might take care to erase and obliterate you from the book of life, you affixed your own signs with your own hand, at his command and bidding, to the blackest book prepared for this purpose, of the reprobate and damned, and of perpetual death: and that he might bind you to such great perfidy and impiety with a greater bond, he branded upon each of you a mark or stigma, as upon his own property: and by his command and orders, you bound yourselves with an oath, sworn by each of you over a circle, which is the symbol of Divinity, carved into the earth, trampling underfoot the sign of the Lord and the cross, etc. etc.

#### A. The Sabbath, the Church of the Initiated.

\[Page 180\]

After all the threads have thus been severed by which those who have departed from the Church of Light remained connected to it, they have now passed over into that of Night; they are initiated into its mysteries, and put into practice what its statutes command. The banquets were, on the first level, boisterous orgies for indulgence, in which the initiates debauched with their initiators. On the second level, they have taken shape as symposia, where the entire retinue, united in league around its duke, gathers at the common table. Now, on the third level, they become sacrificial meals, where their god breaks the bread for his worshippers, and offers the cup to the confederates after pronouncing the curse over it; so that, having partaken in this supper of his substance, and now appropriating it to themselves, they may be transubstantiated into the same, and no longer permitted to depart from him.

This is already announced in the outward form and posture of these banquets. According to Del Rio, the meal was always opened with the formula that served as the prayer before the table: *En nom de Belzebub nostre grand maistre, souverain Commandeur et seigneur, noz viandes, boire et manger soyent garnis et munis pour noz refections, plaisirs et voluptez!* whereupon all chorused: *Ainst soit il!* When the banquet was ended, it was said: *De nostre refection salutaire prinse et veceue nostre Commandeur seigneur ei maistre Belzebub soit loué, gracié et remercié a son exaltation et commun bien!* whereupon the chorus again responded: *Ainsi soit il!*

In the ancient love-feast, it was the wine, from the vine of mildly radiant sun, distilled into the blood of the earth asceticized through cultivation; thus purified in the process of vegetation, and cleansed once more of all its dregs in the process of fermentation, and now gentle, enspiriting, and uplifting, it was held as the symbolic bearer of the higher life-spirit, who bleeds out in death for the race. But in these unlovely gatherings, it is the drink that makes one drunken and raging; sprung from that vine planted in volcanic soil, and in the ash of earthly Solfatara; and, in Egyptian intimation, the heart-blood of the giants, which, when they fell in wild combat, flowed onto the earth, was absorbed; and now it is the fitting expression of the evil that sprouts forth in the sun's blaze, from the earth impregnated with wickedness. \[Page 181\]

This is therefore the potion that the woman on the beast offers to the peoples in the cup; from which the princes drink, and in which the peoples intoxicate themselves. As they now, instead of the mild food of earlier times---milk and honey---choose for their nourishment the milk of the euphorbias, and the honey that drove the Romans, who found it in the Caucasus, to madness: so is their bread not taken from pure, healthy wheat; but from such as has been struck by ergot, smut, and rust, and which therefore holds death and destruction enclosed within itself. Poison and death and putrefaction are thus the signature of the substances in which the Eucharist of Satan is consummated; and which, now taken up into the inner circle of life, unite and bind it with that in whose remembrance they are celebrated. But union on this side is separation on the other; and the Eucharist of Hell, first consummated in the Fall of Man, binds itself to the profanation of that other Eucharist, celebrated in the fruits of the Tree of Life. Hence the blasphemous abominations performed with it on the Sabbaths. A woman confessed in 1457, amid many tears and sighs, in a public avowal before a great multitude of people: how she, for thirty years in succession, had each time secretly removed from her mouth the host received in the Easter communion, and then trampled it underfoot. The same had a priest done with the host consecrated by him; and when he was now led to the stake, he demanded that a cross be erected at the place where he had done it, and along the path by which he was conducted.

Those who have partaken in the sacrificial meal of the Baalim, and thus unified their own life with theirs, have thereby also made themselves fit for spiritual adultery with them; and the whoredom practiced with the demons on the Sabbath is also a service of that gods' festival there. The offering of blood and of seed has the ancient Moloch demanded from his worshippers; both in the literal sense of a service at once bloody and dissolute; or in the offering of their own limbs and of the children who have proceeded from them or also in the natural order. The children of the flesh, following on a wild course the powers to which they have given themselves as prey; torn and rent asunder incurably within themselves by the ungovernable spirits that drag the life fallen to them in opposing directions, decomposed and disintegrated; become, like these spirits themselves, torn and divided in lust and pain, in madness and exhaustion, and again in lustful greed and thirsting blood-lust, in frenzy and deadly rigidity.

Whatever, therefore, the most dissolute madness in lust can devise; whatever a burning sensuality may drive up from its depths; whither unbridled passions, staggering, can lose themselves in delusion; the irremediable doom before which Nature herself recoils: all this is performed and practiced there as service to the new god. The wanton dances are therefore now sacrificial dances; in them death draws near to life, that he may court it; in ever narrower circles they swing around each other, and as the circles interweave themselves into a net, joy enkindles itself ragingly in pain. As tigers and leopards are wont to love, so do the frenzied ones tear each other to pieces in grim lust, and only in blood can the flames be quenched. \[Page 182\]

Therefore, when the witches, elves, druidesses, and night-women, holding the darkly burning pitch-torch in their hands, roam through the night, summoning up their spirits, and, when they have found them, weave them about with their round dances; when shrill tones hold together the torn, angular lines of their dances, and all movements in them take shape against the order of nature; when the swaying and tossing of their heads, as with the shamans, drags them ever deeper into the frenzy: then they resemble those ancient priestesses of Cybele, when these, dressed in women's garments, torch-bearing, head-shaking, with wild cries wandered through the mountains; and then, called by the dark, heavy horn-call, gathered themselves around the altars of the Phrygian mother of the gods; and now, to the rushing, driving sound of flutes, cymbals, and pipes that accompanied the wild galliambics, stamped the earth in sharp cadences; with the knives and daggers that they carried, cooled their frenzy in their own blood; and finally, when the dithyramb had risen to its height, castrated themselves.

Of such a kind is the pavana of the lords' feast, which the gypsies of the middle ages may well have brought from the Orient. That is the proper and common service of the magic church; but since this is built up in the midst of Christianity, another takes place in it as well, introduced for the mockery and scorn of the latter. On the Sabbath, the Devil has in fact built his sacristy onto the church's cathedral; and in this an apish cult is celebrated, of which the witches say that it is more solemn and beautiful than the churchly one. Such depictions in Weber's legends---and never an esteemed one---stood a church, comparable to their village church. Other testimonies of such witnesses who elsewhere had attended the Sabbath mass confirmed: that they had seen there a masonry church, and an altar in it, upon which a demon, the size of a twelve-year-old child, during the whole ceremony held himself motionless, and after the ending of the same disappeared with all the rest.

During the service one heard a music of instruments, intermixed with the ringing of bells, which sounded altogether lovely; without, however, either bells or instruments being visible. If crosses appeared, then their arms were broken; but if the sign of the cross was made, then it happened with mocking words in three languages: In nomine Patrico, aragueaco; Petrica, agora, agora Valentia; Jouanda goure gaitz goustia! accompanied. Holy water was present in a hollow of the wall, at the entrance of the church; it was the urine of the master, and the whole congregation was sprinkled with it. A hierarchy is also established, and just as a queen of the Sabbath makes her appearance, so too a bishop, distinguished by a tiara upon which he walks about; while at solemn masses deacons and subdeacons also come forth. \[Page 183\]

The service usually begins with a proper confession; but in it the penitents do not accuse themselves of their evil deeds, but rather of their good ones; and beg the master, who hears this their confession, for absolution on that account. He then, raising the left arm, absolves them, and imposes on them as penance something like eating meat on Fridays or Saturdays in the fast, or on the eves of feast days, or otherwise whatever pleases him. After the confession the demon clothes himself in priestly garments, and reads mass. Confiteor and Alleluia are omitted; the rest is murmured from a book that he holds in the left hand. At the Offertory he sits down, whereupon the attendees come with black candles to adore; and after they have tremblingly kissed his left hand, they offer to him bread, eggs, and the like, which offerings the queen, at his side, receives in a bowl with his image upon it. Those from Logroño knew only of an altar erected under a tree or rock.

Money is also sacrificed, preferably quartilles, because these have no cross; if they are quarters marked with one, then he steps aside for a time. After the adoration follows the sermon, either delivered by himself in the form of a goat, or by a sorcerer. In the first case, he usually speaks of how he is their true God; and that those who seek another cannot bring about their salvation. An exhortation to persecute the Christians concludes the address, which in the other case mostly urges them to do evil, to accuse the innocent, to help the guilty escape, and to offer many children to the demon. Thereupon the mass continues. The demon raises a black host, with his image, horns beneath the words: This is my body! and the congregation prostrates itself with the words: Aquerra goity, aquerra beity! Goat above, goat below! The same is repeated with the chalice, which he empties. Then the attendees surround the altar in the form of a half-moon; he delivers a second sermon to them, and then communicates them with a part of the host, and a sip of a foul-smelling and abominably tasting drink; which brings them outwardly into a sweat, while bitter cold makes all their nerves and the marrow in their bones stiffen and freeze.

It is not always the demon himself, however, who conducts this ceremony; sometimes ordained priests step in his place. For the ordination itself does not protect against the Sabbath, as shown in the investigations in Labourt and elsewhere. The first in the Basque country in whom the matter came to light was the pastor of Ascain, an old man who confessed himself: how twenty years before he had attended the assembly, had renounced his Creator, and instead of his ordination had accepted that of Satan; and how, although he had often wanted to rid himself of the abomination, the devil had so beset him on that account that he had nearly lost his senses, yet had brought it about: that in all that time he had neither confessed his sin in the confessional, nor admonished others about it from the confessional chair. He named persons whom he had seen at the Sabbath; while two witnesses declared how they too had seen him there; he repeated his confession three times in writing before the judges and his bishop, and stood by it in death. \[Page 184\]

Now accusations against the pastors poured in from all sides, and two of the most vehemently accused, Peter Bocal, 27 years old, and Migalena, 61 years old, were brought to trial. It was found that the first belonged to a family called by sorcery. Seventeen witnesses testified against him: how they had seen him at the Sabbath; indeed, according to these statements, in the night before he had celebrated his first mass, he had already held this one there with great pomp, and the sacrifice at the Sabbath had been more abundant than it later turned out in the church. Asked why he had read earlier at the Sabbath than in the church, he had replied: it had been done for practice, so that he might thereafter perform his office all the better. Twenty-four witnesses had also testified similarly against Migalena. Both were degraded and executed.

Similar statements also lay against others. One from St. Jean de Luz accused the priest Jean Sonhardibels: how at the place Cohandja, in such a mass, at the elevation he had positioned himself so that, with his head downward but his feet upward, he had floated in the air in such a way that the hands in which he held the black host had risen as high as is customary for priests in the church, and in this position he had remained for the duration of a Credo. According to others, the host on such occasions was not round, but triangular; and the congregation was accustomed at the elevation, instead of the prayer, to call out: Black raven, black raven!

According to others, the priest had directed his face not toward the altar, but toward the congregation; and after the elevation, he threw the host to the ground and trampled it underfoot. One must, in all these statements, on the one hand admire the consistency in their perversity; on the other hand, one sees that if, in the church for sanctification, a communal bond and rapport exists among all the members intermingled, in which they have grown together, which in the mystical states comes to consciousness, a similar relation returns in the church of corruption. However, no judgment can be passed on the degree of guilt of those accused, and from the numerous statements against them, this cannot by any means be measured with full certainty. For these statements rested on the vision, which, in order to be possible, certainly required rapports in which the witnesses were connected with the accused. But these must have been occasioned by some guilt, which could in any case be considered proven only for the spiritual realm, in which the testimony of the witnesses also held validity.

#### B. The Closed Sabbath of the Clergy

\[Page 185\]

All these notes are taken from judicial statements, mostly from people of the lower classes, where so much acts disturbingly and confusingly; it might therefore seem desirable if we had before us the memoir of some personality written down in a calmer situation, who had been in such circumstances and, recalling these things in her memory, would be in a position to sketch for us a faithful picture of the impressions she had experienced. This wish is fulfilled for us by that Magdalena Bavent, who played the leading role in the notorious history of the possessed nuns of Louviers. She had been seduced by her own temperament and the influence of bad priests who served as confessors at her convent; she had taken part in all the horrors of the debaucheries there, and when the consequences of them erupted in that affair; then all the possessed had testified against her as the instigator; the episcopal authority had conducted the investigation, but the Parliament of Rouen had taken the judgment in the matter to itself and pronounced a death sentence; Bavent, however, who faced the same fate, was still held once more in her prison. In this situation, she had come to repentance over her licentious life, and her confessor, the priest of the Oratory of the Marais, had induced her to compose a short history of it, in the form of final and testamentary confessions. She based it on the last confession she had made when she had to prepare herself for the impending death; her confessor assisted and guided the pen; and thus these memoirs of the forty-year-old woman arose. Calmly, as it seems, they are written with all the signs of serious repentance; concealing nothing of what might redound to her shame, rejecting only what seemed exaggerated to her in the accusations; and thus, with all the faithfulness and reliability that can be expected of a human being in such circumstances, sketching a picture of her aberrations. Regarding the closed Sabbath of her fellow members of the order, she now lets herself be heard there, p. 23 and following, as follows:

During my imprisonment in this city, I have, on the basis of my earlier statements, been approached by many people for more detailed information about the Sabbath. But my confessor had forbidden me to explain myself on this to anyone other than the judges; therefore I remained silent, a silence that brought me much humiliation from the side of the unsatisfied curiosity, which now refused to believe in my conversion. \[Page 186\]

Now, since I have permission to speak about it, I will give all necessary information on the matter; so that everyone may recognize the gravity of my terrible crimes, and learn to abhor the scene of them. It is for me in this to recount with sincerity what I believe I have seen; the readers will, according to their best judgment in my report, distinguish what they hold to be real from what seems to them illusion. --- I was never carried off otherwise than at nighttime, and after I had slept. Usually before Matins, which with us took place at midnight, it seemed to me once, twice, sometimes in longer indefinite intervals, as if I were called by a nun. I started up from sleep to answer; and when, rising, I came to the door of my cell, I felt myself led away from there, without being able to distinguish how or by whom; for I had lost all consciousness, until I arrived at the accursed place. My rising, as my confessor later observed, provided the occasion for the abduction; I myself, however, did not think of it at the time. Ointment or anything else I never used, but it happened through the power of Picard; of my own self, even if the greatest desire drove me to present myself there, I would not have been able to do it.

After an absence of one, or one and a half, two, or three hours, I found myself again in my cell, and lay down to bed. The place where the Sabbath was held, whether inside or outside the cloister, is unknown to me; I did not perceive the details with sufficient clarity to be able to make a description of it; I would therefore be deceiving the world if I were to sketch a drawing of it. I remember only that the place was rather narrow than spacious; there were no seats there on which to settle, but it was lighted, because of the lights that stood like torches on the altar. The company that appeared there was not numerous; only priests and nuns did I see there, laypeople seldom; perhaps it was not their Sabbath. The evil spirits were frequently present, in half-human, half-animal form, sometimes alone in the former; Picard, in whose presence I always found myself there, pointed them out to me expressly each time. I never saw them, as the nuns were accustomed to recount, in the form of a goat; their place was always near the altar; yet I never perceived any worship rendered to them.

When I speak of the altar, it is because there really was such a one, where the priests said Mass; and the evil spirits stood so near the altar because it was said in their praise; I, however, perhaps saw no worship, though it was, as my confessor said, the highest of all. The host was like ours, yet it always seemed reddish to me and without figure; of this I can judge, because there too one communed. One also performed the elevation, and I heard terrible blasphemies uttered during it. The Mass was said with the paper of blasphemies, which one read aloud in it as the canon, as well as at all consecrations and processions, and which contained the most frightful curses against the most holy Trinity, the holy altar sacrament, the other sacraments, and the ceremonies of the Church, and which was written in a language unknown to me. \[Page 187\]

When one holds banquets, which however, to my knowledge, happened only once or twice, human flesh is eaten thereat. I have also seen there a kind of register, but written in a script unknown to me, which seemed most to resemble that in the testament of the priest David, which was presented to me in court. Picard has indeed spoken to me of a list of the malefactors and the sorcerers, but he has never communicated it to me. The justice has asked me many times for the names of those present at the Sabbath; but I say in truth: these names are not spoken at the places of terror; one thus does not learn them there, unless one has acquaintance with them from elsewhere; to which my secluded life afforded me no opportunity. Everyone is also so occupied there with his own godless doings that he pays little heed to others; unless he is connected with them in some other way, as I was with Picard. Of the speeches made on the spot, I also know little; for aside from the public acts, speaking is done only softly, for the sake of secrecy.

I am in general not so knowledgeable in the mysteries of darkness as one believes; this writing of mine is a kind of open confession, in the face of the Church of God, for some atonement for the scandal that I have given; and it shall contain only truth, and come as close as possible to that which I shall one day lay before my higher Judge. Besides Picard, whom I have always seen there with me, and without whom I was never present there, I have also recognized his vicar Boullé; beside them several priests, whose names I do not know, engaged in the ceremonies there; then also four nuns of my convent: Catharina of the Cross, Catharina of St. Genevieve, Elisabeth of the Nativity, and Anna Barre; the latter, however, seldom. Of the others whom I glimpsed there by face, without knowing their names, two in particular have stuck in my mind: one 50--60 years old, clothed in violet, black hair mixed with gray, of middle stature, stout, but ill on his feet; and another, concerning whom I have always been questioned, and of whom the nuns have testified under exorcism: that it was Mother Franziska or Simonette of Paris, the former superior of the convent of St. Louis, who had then withdrawn to the capital. She was never named to me at the Sabbath, however, and I have also never known her personally; and I wish from my heart never to have seen her there.

All the acts that I have seen performed at the Sabbath are dishonorable; and it is impossible that I should recall them otherwise than with shuddering. Those who question me about the particulars do not know what pain they thereby inflict on me; my confessor himself has questioned me, on account of the shame and confusion in which he has always seen me thereby, only about the barest necessities. So much is certain: the saints of God do great things; but the unholy ones of the devil yield to them in nothing on the other side. The wickedness of the priests who attend the Sabbath drives them at times to read mass over large hosts, then to cut them out in the middle, to paste them onto a parchment prepared in like manner, and then to use them in shameful ways for their lusts. In such things I have indeed only once or twice participated, and it would be better to make such abominable vices forgotten than to bring them to mind; but since I here lay my general confession, I cannot pass over them in silence. \[Page 188\]

On a Maundy Thursday, Picard and Boullé had brought four hosts; they took two into their mouths, gave then two others to that aforementioned Simonette and to me, and finally they exchanged the ones taken; that served to strengthen the bond. One night, after the paper of blasphemy had been carried in procession for a while, a small cross was brought in, to which a large host was fastened with small nails at the hands and feet of the figure depicted upon it; at the same time, each of us had also to wound the side. Two or three drops of blood flowed out, which were collected and, combined with the host, used for magical purposes. This means, without doubt, crucifying the Lord a second time; as I then often saw the like practiced, even on hosts that had been consecrated on the Sabbath, though from these no blood flowed.

A priest once brought a host to the Sabbath to burn it; but this time the Savior himself appeared and struck the priest with his lightnings, so that nothing more of him could be found; the host, however, shot up into the air. The demons fled, all was in consternation; but this established example by no means put an end to the assemblies. I saw another priest carry a chalice with the blood of the Lord to the Sabbath. He thrust a knife into it, which became entirely bloody. A second did likewise, and the substance likewise turned to blood; and when a third repeated the act, it overflowed from the overfull chalice onto the earth. The Lord, in the company of the Holy Virgin and several saints, came thereunto and commanded the fleeing demons to remain. The priests were turned to ashes and seen no more; but the blood was collected with the earth and carried away. If these things thus occurred in reality---over which I leave the judgment to others---so are they great abominations, and alongside them great miracles; and my conviction of the real presence of the Savior in the holy sacrament has, through all these events wherein earth and hell have united in their rage against him, only been strengthened. \[Page 189\]

On a Good Friday a woman brought her newborn child; they resolved to nail it to a cross. The nails were driven through hosts, through which they nailed it fast; other nails were driven into its head as a crown, just as they also pierced its side; thereafter it was used for maleficia. Two persons who had perhaps strayed to the Sabbath out of curiosity were, because they refused to take part in its godlessnesses, crucified and killed there. On a Maundy Thursday I saw the Coena performed in a terrible manner. They brought a completely roasted child, and it was eaten by those present; I do not know with complete certainty whether I took part in it. I said to my confessor: it may well have been so; yet it seemed to me that I soon desisted, because the flesh seemed very tasteless to me. During the meal a demon went around the table and cried: Not one among you will betray me! I believe they repeat with these words the promise they gave one another not to betray each other, but to remain faithful to the devil. That is all that has remained in my memory with certainty from the Sabbath, after I have carefully searched my conscience and been questioned about it very often. One must not believe that more can be asked of me than I told my confessor, as he prepared me for death. The judgment over the reality of these things I leave to the discernment of others; but I beseech the justice, if it takes regard to my testimony, only to pay attention to what I can say with certainty. As long as Picard lived, I was moreover always led to the Sabbath.---Remarkable in this report is the threefold repetition: how she does not know whether all that was seen was thus in reality, or whether it only appeared so to her; a doubt whose good foundation we shall discuss elsewhere.

Also what is of importance, that in their prescriptions, where they demand back a part of their body, which the spirit, as with the Ferry, has taken from her under great pains--- what Picard called a flesh knot for the maleficia--- first she herself speaks, and then lets the demon reply; and likewise the acceptation of their bill of exchange drawn on body and life, which Astaroth adds. When the confessor asked her about this circumstance, she replied: she had not known what she had written, since she had been entirely beside herself, and had scarcely known herself.

#### C. The Liturgy of the Sabbath

\[Page 190\]

After these revelations about the service, as it is celebrated on the Sabbath, that which Maria von Sains has stated about the rituals there is only the consequence of the once-adopted principle; and it matters little whether, in these statements--- which may very well be so--- the lucubrations and brooding thoughts of the waking state have imagined themselves into the demonic hell-sleep; or whether, conversely, the visions of this sleep have mirrored themselves in the remembrance of wakefulness. After she has spoken, namely, of the images of the gods, which in animal form as dragon, serpent; or in human form, after the manner of the ancient pagans, are formed, baptized, and worshiped on the Sabbath; she also speaks of the sacraments of the synagogue, of which she knows only four: baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, and marriage, since confession is practiced only in mockery of the Christians. Not all priests are admitted to the sacrifice; only twelve out of all are chosen, to perform it in the order prescribed by the master. Every Sunday the attendees are sprinkled with the blood of the Lord, under the general outcry: Sanguis ejus super nos et super filios nostros! In the mass a thousand unworthinesses are committed: Some stick out their tongues, others blaspheme, others uncover their nakedness; all of which becomes even more boisterous at the elevation, since then the demons and the notables of the society, turning their backs to the sacrament, approach the altar. No singing is done at the mass, the lights smell foul; instead of Ite Missa est! the synagogue says: Allez à tous les Diables! All the Psalms of David are sung, as in the church, but all directed to Lucifer, Beelzebub, Leviathan. The Pater noster is likewise turned toward Lucifer: Ego te accipio in patrem, qui in coelis es, sanctificetur nomen tuum per universum mundum --- --- et libera nos ab omni malo! The English greeting is directed in the same manner to the mother of the Antichrist: Salve virgo plarimum veneranda, plena gratiarum, Dominus tecum est etc. The Symbolum begins: Credo in Deum patrem Luciferum, qui creavit coelum et terram. Et in filium ejus Belzebub, qui conceptus est de spiritu sancto, qui reducit mundum, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in spiritum sanctum Leviathan, et Ecclesiam sanctam Catholicam, reformatam Synagogam, Communionem sanctorum, Remissionem peccatorum, et vitam aeternam, Amen. The Sabbath also keeps the ten commandments: Luciferum ut Deum verum adorabis, et alium extra ipsum non amabis. Nomen Jesu assidue blasphemabis. Sabbata Synagogae sanctificabis. Patrem ac matrem odio habebis. Viros pariter ac mulieres, puerosque trucidabis. Adulteria, et omnem fornicationem et crimina nefanda committere non dubitabis. Usuras, furta atque rapinas exercebis. Falsa testimonia ac mendacia dicundo praeelectabis. Uxorem proximi tui et possessionem proximi tui concupiscis. \[Page 191\]

As works of mercy are considered: to refuse food, drink, and clothing to the poor, not to take in the stranger, to abandon the weak and the imprisoned, to dig up the buried children for the Sabbath, to sow errors and heresies, to multiply doubts and scruples, to burden the afflicted with even greater affliction, to make those who have fallen into sin fall even deeper, not to pray for the deceased, to bear adversities with impatience. Mortal sins are held there to be: to live in humility, chastity, patience, moderation, compassion, and piety. For all virtues count as vices: extravagance stands in for chastity, gluttony for moderation, envy for neighborly love, avarice for generosity, pride for humility, impatience for long-suffering, and so too blasphemy for fortitude. Litanies are likewise held there, and in them, for example: *Ut Ecclesiam Catholicam apostolicam Romanam, per haereses turbare et destruere digneris, te rogamus audi nos*; *ut Ordines ac Religiones difformare et extirpare digneris*. --- *Ut congregationes nostras conservare in sanitate ab omni malo digneris*. --- *Ut rabiem nostram contra Deum et homines et Sanctos, qui sunt et futuri sunt, semper fovere digneris*. --- *Ut nos in cordis nostri duritie perpetuo retinere digneris*. --- *Ut nobis auxilium dones, ad resistendum semper spiritui sancto et divinis eius inspirationibus et admonitionibus, et quicquid saluti nostrae deseruire posset*. --- *Te rogamus audi nos*.

One sees that much from this ritual is still today useful for the secret service of many a doctrine that has purified the Sabbath, after cleansing it of all superstition and the ridiculous abstractions of the Middle Ages, and setting it upon tangibility, now holds it in broad daylight on the open market. Also a sermon that Beelzebub held on Trinity Sunday would be very useful; if one were to seat at the throne, instead of the obsolete three demons of the speaker, Leviathan's, and Asmodeus's, who sat there at that time --- their faces like a man's face, body, feet, and hands of a devil's feet, each with horns on the head, a golden tiara like the high priest --- three God-men: the God-philosopher, in whom pantheism has incarnated itself; the God-pleasure-seeker, husband of the exalted Lady Sophia of the Saint-Simonists; and the God-emperor of this world, in whom absolute liberal tyranny has become flesh.

The three could then speak from one mouth with the orator: My friends, today the great day of the most holy Trinity shines forth in humanity. We three are one in essence, but in substance completely equal to one another; almighty, because the three kings of the world; all-knowing, precisely because we ourselves are the All. In a word, we are able to bring forth everything, and again to transform it into nothing. *Filioli mei, vestrum est omni conamine sanctissimam trinitatem coeli contemnere: vestrum est, contemnentes dicere: Draco crudelissime, serpens venenose, Cerbere triceps!* Rejoice, my sons, that you have brought forth from your midst a God, threefold in person but one in full union; who in the first has freed you from all your superstition in the being of a supernatural God and his entire court; who in the second has overwhelmed you with all delights and blessed you with the liberation of the flesh; who in the third has freed you from all the needs of free will, and directed you to your true Lord, fate. At the close, the choir then sings the hymn: *Cerbere triceps, Draco crudelissime!*

\[Page 192\]

Those who have turned themselves toward the nocturnal side of nature have there found the star of the night; and by setting themselves in rapport with it through their abdominal cerebrum, which is itself a moon in the organic body, they have become moonstruck from the side of nature, and the moon, moving them in ebbs and flows, has drawn them up to itself, but in truth down beneath itself. In this direction of nature, which has made them moon-women if they belong to the other sex; or such as conduct themselves in the manner of women if they were men who have turned aside to this side; the realm of death is unveiled to them in clear sleep, that realm which hides itself in the midst of the realm of life and encompasses within itself all the lower roots of being; and they now behold the rising and descending of the elements in the alternating intercourse of both realms. In this natural relation of such moon-wives, the mythical has been added in antiquity; in those nocturnal domains they have found Hecate, the terrible night-goddess, who, as the moon has three forms, so has a threefold countenance. She has been to them the guardian of all night-births, the ruler in the angle named after her, that great cave on the moon's disk where the departed obtain punishment for their wickednesses. She was to them the wrathful one who drives the night-wanderer along his paths; she has unlocked for them the underworld of the departed, which adjoins that realm of death; and thus the moon-women of antiquity have become necromantic sorceresses when they have turned to the evil side. In Christendom, where all relations of nature are spiritualized, and in this spiritualization the opposition of the religious-ethical good and evil is purely and sharply driven forth, those sorceresses, passing through the domain of nature and the psychic, have turned even more decisively to the final side. By taking the demonic as their center, and nourishing themselves physically with the shadows of substances, but spiritually satisfying themselves with the empty semblances of ideas, and working all this into somnambulistic illusory movements; they have likewise had to transpose themselves, formally transubstantiating themselves into the object of their choice, out of truth into the lie of a semblance-existence; which, however, in the concrete reality of evil, has nonetheless attained its negative reality as a contradiction against the positive of the good. But he who in spirit and will and in life has chosen a new center, gains, by appropriating it to himself in all these powers, new modalities of the thus remodeled faculties; in life, spirit, and will, new circles form for him, altered rapports, other ranges of his activities; and with changing intentions and purposes, altered modes of effect in differently positioned spheres of effect. We have therefore previously considered the subjective transformations that he experiences who enters into the domain of the new center of gravity, and the new polarities and tensions around it; then it remains for us now to assume also these differently modified repercussions of our mode of consideration. How has one who has become at home in those circles found his way in them? What new atmospheres have his powers drawn around themselves? What domain, what range and scope of force have they gained? What elective affinities have thrust themselves forth around them? How have their directions been modified? In short, how has the subjectively overturned human now also transformed himself in all his objective modes of effect, and what power has he attained in them? This investigation too we shall conduct, following the facts at hand, in such a way that we descend gradually from the height we reached in the previous one down to the depths.

### Chapter 1. Spiritual Reports

\[Page 193\]

There are two invisible churches on earth: that of the Lord, to which all good belongs that this earth holds within itself; and that of his adversary, in which all evil is enclosed that has spread itself within it. All those in whom the good dwells in an eminent degree; all who, in his possession, enjoy a highly elevated inner life; all mystical saints, are beholding, active members of the first of these two churches; they stand in immediate intercourse with their invisible center, which reveals itself to them nearer or more distant. But others are connected to it only by the bond of faith; they do not behold, in the measure in which they have remained strangers to the inner life, into the inner of the mysteries---only their outer side becomes manifest to them; there they traffic only actively insofar as they are called by grace. Both, however---the esoteric as well as the exoteric---are embraced by one and the same visible outer church, in which that invisible inner one dwells, which now reveals itself to different ones in different ways; but all are regulated and led to the goal by the common, universally valid norm revealed for this purpose.

In analogous manner is it also arranged with the other invisible church, in which is found the center that unites and cherishes all evil. It is the night-covered abyss in which it is built; the subterranean hearth where the evil flames drive the evil waters above themselves to the surface; where the poison dragon lies at the roots of the world tree and gnaws them. Also in human nature open wells that reach into this abyss; but the other church, hostile to it, has closed and sealed them. Whoever now tears open these seals; whoever presses into an inner life, not to elevate himself in it and drink from the source of the good water, but to question the abyss for its secrets and to make its powers allies to himself: he will indeed become an active and beholding member of this other church; he sees the guiding center of this realm and feels its influences. He knows henceforth what to do in all his doing; the evil does not proceed from him as if by chance, but it is sought with consciousness; for it has substantially incorporated itself into him. He therefore acts also in the whole inner power and might of this evil; while those who stand outside enjoy only the help that its outer bond offers them.

Because, however, things down here are calculated on the outer life, on the sober state of waking, this invisible church of evil also has the inner drive to embody itself in an outer, visible one and, in it, to transplant itself into the midst of the waking world. The invisible inner center therefore seeks outer and visible centers for itself, on which it lays from its spirit, and in which it can therefore now regulate itself in the outer world. Such are now the representatives and the mandataries of the center; they act in its full power and its might, and immediately begins the process of appropriation and organization around them. But all organic organization on earth is carried out through instincts. Thus it has been natural instincts, life instincts, in which the household---the common ground of all other association---has shaped itself; political instincts for protection and defense and for shielding personal freedom, and spiritual instincts to bring forth the best well-order, have then founded the state thereon. From just such instincts, only directed to a higher world order, inasmuch as they, ascending, meet the downward-directed effect of the spirit from above, was the Christian church, in the midst of heathendom, to the astonishment of the world-wise, built up. \[Page 194\]

In like manner, there will now arise demonic darknesses, self-destructive and deformative impulses in evil, growing toward the enchantment of the negating spirit from below, building around him and his vicars the false structures of an external church of evil. These visible viceroys of the invisible principle in the midst are the depositories of the enchantment; they preserve in the scrinium pectoris the curse that has become living and sprouting within them; they rule the instincts in which it has taken root; and thereby they are lords and regents among the children of the dragon's seed, the queen bees around whom their swarms gather; the preservers and increasers of their realm. In the demonic rapportages, as whose tangible and visible central points they appear, they are masters of the throng that presses around them; and they form around themselves the dioceses of that rebellious church which descends into the realms of downfall.

#### A. The Mystagogues of the Enchantment-Being

If someone has attained the consecration of the spirit of midnight, and the seven-parted ray of the darkness dwelling within him has come over him, then he becomes its vicar; the nights stream together in him, so that in the midst of their gloom he becomes a blacker, night-enveloped point that engulfs the light, and binds to himself all spirits that enter into the current, and henceforth appears as their central point and their leader and their master. Of such a kind was that succession of degenerate priests in Norman Louviers, of whom we have already made mention earlier: David, Picard, Boulle, who, by handing down their mandate---the canon of blasphemies---from one to the other on the deathbed as a hereditary bequest, transmitted their consecration to one another, and thus formed a whole lineage of such mystagogues.

They were Ophites, after the manner of that ancient Gnostic school, who, abusing the inexperience of the girls shut up in that convent in the most wicked way, endeavored to gradually divert their zeal for advancing on the path of the inner life into their own ways. They spoke to them of contemplation, inner light, ecstasies, transformations, self-annihilations, and of the hidden life in the spirit; they ceaselessly urged them on to rise to that spirituality which would lead them to the choirs of angels, and finally even into God himself. Then they would be exalted above the law, living only in love, comforted by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and free in the freedom of the Lord, and established in this freedom, they need no longer heed the stirrings of the passions in the deeper regions; but mortifying all shame and timidity, they would find themselves empowered to give free rein to sensuality; because a spirit most intimately united with God could never sin.

Thus combining the highest spiritual tension with the deepest profligacy, they must gradually gain the greatest power over the spirit of those who had been incautiously surrendered to them; all the more so, since the seclusion and solitude of the conventual life at once furthered and concealed the designs of the seducers. This spiritual dominion soon manifested itself physically as well. One of the nuns testified later against Picard: that when he once unexpectedly touched her on the side with the tip of his finger, she immediately felt a violent pain at that spot, which thereafter persisted constantly, and intensified every time relics were brought near the place; moreover, since that moment a violent agitation had seized her whenever she went to communion or beheld the magician. \[Page 195\]

Magdalena Bavent testified against him: how she had seen in his hands a register, consisting of three closely written sheets, into which he had inscribed the names of those whom he boasted of ruling, or who had assisted him helpfully in his misdeeds. All these had their intention directed toward him; he formed the center in which all these directions met, and mediated their connection with the root-like Evil. Just as in the Savior the highest ground, the supernatural moment, is present, while in the spiritually heightened nature of the Saints the natural element of all visions of the heights prevails; so likewise in the root-like Evil does the higher---or rather deeper---ground of all demonic visions lie, the Sabbath included; and in the central nature of such magical mystagogues, more closely bound up with it, the natural vinculum prevails, in which everything connects itself into a whole.

If now the outer waking life, in all earthly relations, has its logical categories, in which it comprehends all natural effects; then the inner life, whether in light-sleep or in dark-sleep, likewise has its own, in which it comprehends the inner impressions. The color and application of these categories, belonging to the subjective human being, will change with his nature and mood; while that other overarching moment, essentially always the same, takes the fleeting change in the visions---arising from subjectivity---and always directs it enduringly toward the same point, thereby fixing it. Thus will it also be arranged around the Sabbath. In its innermost essence built up around the core of Evil, it is among the peasants predominantly grasped in the character of the Venusberg and a raw debauchery; in the midst of a warlike knighthood it would have assumed the form of a wild hunt and a hellish Valhalla. Here around Picard, and with his retinue, under the enclosure of cloistered nuns, it has---as we have seen---taken the form of an abyssal monastery, in which every sort of blasphemy and desecration of the Holy is practiced. What in the novitiate partly occurred in reality has, in the vision, only been heightened. Especially with Bavent was the degenerate priest closely bound, and one sees clearly that both had concluded a demonic marriage with each other, and that the Sabbath was the foundation on which they built their house. Therefore it is he who, in his patriarchal power, always abducts her to the Sabbath according to his intention; she finds herself there, always inseparably at his side, just as others hold to others---the same persons always meet there together. But she beholds everything always in and through her leader. \[Page 196\]

The Logos in the human being, when in the saints it binds itself more closely to the Logos in God, and in greater proximity to the light also greens forth in its own heightened vegetation and ramifies; has there---as we have noticed---formed its own mystical language. The same Logos, when in the underground shafts, in the proximity of the shadowing principle, torn asunder and cleft in sickly drive-force, will likewise acquire its own idiom. That we see returning here also in the relation of this marriage, concluded under a curse; an own language has formed among the companions, and this has formed its own secret script, which only the initiates understood how to read. The nuns said of her: she had given birth four times on the Sabbath; a testimony that she does not accept, probably because she did not grasp that it happened in the spirit. This marriage was concluded, moreover, for life and death; indeed, beyond death, she would have roused the audacity for it within herself. "In the night of the day on which Picard died," she herself recounts to us, "I was abducted to the barn of Mesnil-Jourdain, five quarter-hours from the monastery, to his corpse. He was at the edge of a grave, and the vicar Boulle raised him somewhat by the shoulders; many demons were gathered around the body."

He urged me thus: it was now time to fulfill my promise to share the same fate with him. I was ordered to seize him by the feet, which I found very cold. I was told to descend three steps into the pit toward him; but when I saw frightful flames therein, I quickly climbed back out, declaring that I had never promised to be damned with him, and that now, having come to my senses, I must take thought for my own salvation; whereupon I was led back to my cell. Twice more I was later brought to him, saw his corpse, and beside it a frightful beast.\" She had already earlier shared in the sufferings of the dying man, which appeared to her quite naturally in the form of demonic temptations; after the hour of death had passed, there came the admonitions to restore the rapport, beyond life, through the conclusion of a marriage. But now, frightened by the flames, she breaks loose from the bond, rends the tie asunder, and the Sabbath is henceforth sunk from her sight. What we have here shown by the example of Picard and of Bavent can likewise be traced into others; although, to our knowledge, in no second case do recorded reminiscences of one of the parties involved permit us deeper insights into the nature of the contracted relation. The Provençal Louis Goffredy of Beauvezer had, by his own confession, among other things received from his uncle a book on magic, which at first he had not esteemed, but whose spells he one day attempted. \[Page 197\]

Then the invoked spirit appeared to him, talked him out of his scruples against a pact, and concluded such a one on the condition that, in return for the threefold surrender of his soul, his body, and all his actions, he would render him threefold service: to make him the most honored of all priests in Provence; to grant him 34 years of life without illness or other affliction; and to inflame in his name all women whom he breathed upon with love for him. He now goes to Marseille and obtains there, at the church of the Accoules, a benefice. The fame of his holiness soon fills the region; all women crowd to his confessional, and he now finds opportunity to apply the magic of his breath, more than a thousand times, as he says, and rejoices as all around bursts into love for him. The wife of the innkeeper Perrin was brought so far that a palpitating heart announced to her his approach from afar each time; another, named Bouchette, and a third, named Pintade, likewise became, one after another, victims of his lusts. But preeminently the three daughters of a nobleman, Mandals de la Pallus, and among them especially the then ten-year-old Magdalena, had aroused this lust of his, because his reputation had granted him free access to the house. Since the girl had taken him as her confessor, he had already in this relation allowed himself many liberties with her, and a deep melancholy had developed in her from such intercourse. She often lived on an estate near the city, and he too went there back and forth. First he breathed upon the mother, so that she too was won over and led the daughter to the seducer; whom he himself likewise so often made to feel the power of his breath, and whom moreover he assailed multifariously with other magic, until she, meanwhile advanced in age, yielded herself to him. When he once found her alone on the country estate, he induced her to accompany him to a cave near the estate, where he promised to show her great wonders. There they found many men and women engaged in dancing around the goat. Magdalena at first felt a great terror, but Goffredy gave her courage: they were only her friends whom she saw gathered here, and whose company she henceforth should belong to. \[Page 198\]

He had previously told her: for her sake he had called upon all the demonic powers to his aid; and since he had now won everything in her, he wished to unite her in the bonds of marriage with the prince of the demons, so that she might find herself united with him and one another in him, with all the greater security, indissolubly. She, who had already previously acknowledged the principle that the spiritual fathers had the right to dispose over their spiritual daughters, also took a liking to this proposal. This was now concluded and carried out in this assembly. She was baptized with sulfur, salt, and urine; she now renounced, from her whole heart, from all her powers, and from her entire soul, her God and her faith, and signed the renunciation with the blood from the little finger of her right hand, which he had incised. Six or seven written vows followed this first one, to draw the already tied knot even tighter. She was then marked on her head, on her heart, and on various other places; and now all those present danced around her jubilantly, and in general acclamation they proclaimed the newly received one as the princess of the Sabbath; which she from then on regularly attended in this capacity. Goffredy himself had already belonged to it since his pact; they had appointed him there as prince of the synagogues of France, Spain, England, Teutschland, Turkey, thus of Europe and a part of Asia; and as such he had visited the Sabbaths of all these countries and presided over them.

Her master thereupon gave her the demon Asmodeus as her attendant, so that he might serve her, guard her for him, and preserve and increase in her the love for him. Things had thus proceeded for a time when the bizarre thought came to her: to enter the convent of the holy Ursula, which flourished under the care of the priests of the Christian Doctrine. Goffredy opposed this plan with the utmost vigor; but since he could not become master over it, he threatened to unleash the powers of hell against the convent. She remained three years with the Ursulines in considerable calm, only that on Wednesdays and Fridays, the critical days when the Sabbath was held, a black melancholy would take possession of her, which made her unbearable to herself and to all the world. She is now, after her reception, possessed by five demons, and beside her Louise Cappel by three; and the otherwise so peaceful convent becomes full of the noise and contortions of the possessed, so that terror and horror seize the superiors.

Here too it is visibly apparent: that a somnambulistic predisposition lay at the foundation, which a bad priest had turned toward the demonic, and finally heightened to possession. The means he first employed was the breath, that aura in which so many natural connections are forged; in the ecclesiastical so often the conductor of the spirit from above and of his gifts, therefore also in the anti-ecclesiastical of the spirit from below and of his curse. The melancholy in early youth marks the first stage of the evil. This is heightened with persistently maintained sensuality, until the demonic witches' sleep with the entire scenery of the Sabbath has developed itself, and the second stage is now fully formed. Now the incipient partial possession emerges, and with it the third stage, where Asmodeus has taken possession of those organs to which the actions of sensuality are also directed. Finally the fourth stage has begun, when, in an impulse of return, those earlier melancholic attacks, still chained to the Sabbath time, have likewise returned, and now at last the full fivefold possession with all its manifestations sets in. \[Page 199\]

It is worthy of note that here it is expressly stated that the marriage with the seducer is not concluded immediately with him, but with the demon. The Church is the bride of the Redeemer, and all spiritual marriages within her compass are concluded in him. In the same way, the Church of the Demon is bound to him by a like bond of marriage; all her members draw one another together because they are drawn by him, all their connections are thus concluded in him. This too is remarkable enough: that the instincts in this case have already driven forth a kind of universal monarchy over two parts of the world, which should have been allotted to him who on the mountain height had paid homage to the denying spirit.

#### B. The Spiritual Magic Means in the Misuse of the Sacraments and Sacramentals

If now such a hierophant has been found for the formation of a branch of the underworld Church, and has begun the work of appropriation around him; then this work will be powerfully advanced if such binding means stand at his disposal: those which on the one hand permanently bind to him all who already stand in community with him; on the other hand, working outward, help to draw others across into the same through sensuality, terror, fear, despair. Such binding means are now the maleficia of a twofold kind: such as aim merely at temptation, and others that bind more closely in possession. We have already found the like in the earliest times among the demonic sects; and tradition has known how to report to us concerning the irresistibility of their effects, once the assent of the will has joined in. Through the more recent times the evil has propagated itself, and the magic books are full of praise for their efficacy.

Like the sacraments of the Church, a material enters into their composition, mostly of obscene kind and bordering on putrefaction and decay. As form, the holy then unites itself with that which thus in abhorrence outrages nature; and thus one of the sacramentals in the lower degrees, higher up a sacrament, in the deepest sense the Eucharist; and the gray or black powder that has now arisen is sprinkled about, or taken in food, and now does its never-failing work. As alkahest and actual spiritual death-tincture, there prevails in this realm that olla podrida which, according to the account of Ma ria of Sains, Goffredy first brewed. It consisted of consecrated hosts, specially desecrated beforehand, of the blood consecrated by him on the Sabbath, mixed with bones from the goat, the powder of skulls of murdered children, the seed of the men and women present, blood, hairs, nails, and all uncleanness.

Three times had the demons held council over the new invention, the inventor and his confidants had pronounced the words of consecration over it, and they had then sent it to the prince of the demons, and he had imparted to it the effective power, infallibly to bring forth possession. The Sabbath brought him in thanks there for many boy-sacrifices; but the inventor of the new poison-means was on that account elevated to the highest principality over the magic realms. We let the truth or falsehood of these specific statements rest here for themselves, and investigate here only what truth there is in the whole matter. The sacraments and sacramentals are in their inmost essence withdrawn from the natural region of things, and belong to a higher order of the same. Their effect is therefore also, in the ordinary course of things, directed toward this order of salvation, and spreads itself only exceptionally down to the lower natural orders, since these by no means entirely close themselves to them. \[Page 200\]

For there is also a natural side to them, in which their higher being dwells; and they are now received into the double order of man, affecting the higher order preferentially through their essential nature, but in the deeper order finding the paths of transition mediated through their matter; only that in the current circumstances of life this their influence hides itself behind the plasticity of the envelope. But if this envelope has become more easily penetrable in the saints, and more opened in transparency and permeability; then also this their action will become perceptible in the more mobile medium, and we have seen in the second volume of this book many examples of that hagioscopic susceptibility for such influences.

Sister Margaretha of the Holy Sacrament was thus, in her twelfth year, overtaken by violent convulsions, followed by a twelve-day state of half-sleep. Then a frightful condition came over her, from which only the laying on of a scapular freed her. Soon there followed such a heaviness in all her limbs that she could no longer hold herself on her feet, and, lying on the bed, could not move any of her leaden-heavy limbs; so that for seven to eight days she could scarcely take any food to herself. Then again, since all the doctors' remedies proved ineffective, violent convulsions followed. In this state one heard her call out with the accent of an enraptured soul: Let me regain my strength before the most holy Sacrament! The sisters resolved, upon her repeated cry, to carry the sick one into the choir; but when they tried to take the suppliant into their arms, none was able to lift her alone; only the strongest among them could at last, with unspeakable effort, bring her to the place. As soon as she had arrived at the door of the choir, there came, like a shining cloud from the tabernacle, which enveloped her and drove out the spirits. The cloud not only restored strength to her body, but made it so agile that she was sometimes carried from the choir door, at other times even from the cloister gate, as far as the altar railing. A wonderful peace descended upon her, and she, who through her illness had also lost the use of her sight, yet saw the object of her longing when it was exposed.

Once the efficacy of the remedy was known, they brought her from time to time into the choir and let her remain there for 3--4 hours; when she then returned to the sickroom, all her sufferings immediately returned. The doctors attributed her ills to a congestion of evil humors in the brain, and applied cupping to her head against it; she endured everything with the greatest resignation, although she well recognized the uselessness of the procedure. They then wanted to provide an outlet for the fluids between the skull and the brain membrane through trepanation. It was done, but no fluid nor vapor could be seen: everything was perfectly sound and healthy. This determined the superior, a wise and virtuous woman, to make a trial with obedience. In the convent was preserved the little cloak of the saintly Cardinal de Bérulle; this she laid upon her with the words: My sister, be healthy out of obedience to our most revered father! Immediately her convulsions ceased, which upon its return happened several times with the same success. At last the superior spoke the words: Be completely healthy in obedience, without convulsions, ravings, and blindness, and eat unhindered like the others. Immediately she was freed from all her ills, and henceforth ate without discomfort, as the doctors attested with official certificates. \[Page 201\]

Thus, the sacraments, on the good side, in properly attuned dispositions, produce such physical changes; then, toward the left side as well, this influence will not fail, provided that in the organs there exists that easily movable mobility. Such a mobility-attuned excitability is never lacking here, where the true virtuosity is at hand; only is it arranged, according to its kind, for infernal stimuli. Such a nature will now, as we have already seen in many examples, spasmodically close itself entirely to the higher, sacramental stimulus, and reject it as hostile. If it is therefore to enter into her, something homogeneous to the repelling element must mediate the transition, and that can be nothing other than the profaning, blaspheming element, which, by veiling the inner indestructible form, now becomes a means of appropriation between opposing natures. The same personal guilt that enwraps the dominated will in the malicious one has now also embraced the sacrament with its abomination; and as it reaches over with this congenial atmosphere into the circle of life, its direct direction is turned into the perverted one prevailing there; and with the same energy with which it otherwise acts elevatingly, we now see it exert a depressing effect, one physically perceptible as well.

Thus the efficacy of this kind of magical means is understood, which, deflecting from healthy life, by no means lead it over into the morbid state; but upon that already inwardly diseased, they exert their full influence, and in the case of a certain attunement, draw it deeper and deeper down into confusion. In all reports on sorcery, frequent mention is made of these means; the belief in their power is rooted most deeply in this entire domain, just as much as the belief in the power of medicines in the natural domain; and there must have lain in this conviction a truth, but one of a magical nature, to be sure. The entire practice rested on the principle of the Manicheans: below in the depths is the dwelling of the Prince of Night, who, surrounded there by his people at the borders of darkness, ceaselessly labors to capture away the rays of the uncreated light, and to lay the words of God in fetters. The simple consequence was now that for these emanations of the divinity, which had fallen into the captivity of the powers of darkness, a food and a drink for preservation and strengthening had to be prepared; and that was that magical repast, prepared from the sacraments and sacramentals; just as those rays of light are captured into the material night, so into the horror and the abhorrence and the putrefaction, the frothing of sin.

Very instructive and significant is what occurred in the convent of Louviers regarding such things. As a result of the errors and confusions there, many nuns had become possessed; they were exorcised, and from the statements of their spirits it emerged that Picard had applied six different kinds of magic within the convent. One was composed to keep the nuns in constant discord; another, to awaken in their hearts a disordered inclination toward Picard and la Bavent; the third, to shake their chastity; the fourth, to awaken in them an inner aversion to faith, hope, and love, and to provoke blasphemies against God in them; the fifth, to arouse in them a desire for the Sabbath and all magic; the sixth, to produce in them a contempt and abhorrence toward all sacraments. They now continued the exorcisms to compel them to indicate the places where they were hidden, and to bring them to light. \[Page 202\]

The sorely pressed ones at last found themselves compelled to obey; and a great multitude of persons drawn together were eyewitnesses as they were truly found in their hiding places, and authentic verbal protocols were drawn up concerning it. On 14 June 1643, in accordance with the declaration of the spirit in Sister Maria of the Holy Sacrament, who called himself Putiphar, in the evening between 7 and 8 in her chamber, from a wooden paneling of the walls that had never seemed to be opened, the first was drawn forth. The second, the last among those enumerated above, was found on the 30th of July under the high altar six feet deep under the earth. On the 19th in the evening at half eleven a third in the sacristy, from the same depth; and on the 24th of August at half twelve in the cloister between the four doors a fourth. On the 8th of September at eight o'clock in the evening another followed, nine feet deep under the pillar of the new building, brought to light in the presence of the Archbishop of Toulouse. Again two others on the epistle and gospel sides of the altar, from a depth of 6 to 8 feet; and yet a tenth on the 1st of December between 1 and 2 after midnight, in the interior of the choir, near the door; from a place that had more than twelve feet of depth. An eleventh and a twelfth then came still on the 22nd of January, and were drawn to the light from a depth of more than 7 feet, directly under the image of the Holy Virgin in her chapel,

The possessed now spoke with wonder, concerning all these magic instruments, those who had indicated their place even before they were found, circumstantially of their composition, of the inscriptions under which they had been fabricated on the Sabbath; they gave all their components, the ligatures and knots applied to them, the letters with which they were marked, and all other circumstances, without ever erring in the smallest detail. Before one began to dig, they designated some spot on the floor, and indicated: directly perpendicular beneath it, in a depth of 6 to 7, 8 to 9 up to 12 feet, the magic lay. One proceeded accordingly in digging, and always found it at the spot indicated by the exorcism. They stated: some were marked with the letters M. P. and M. B., the names of Picard and of Bavent; they testified that at a certain place lay the testament of David and Picard written in the Arabic language of the Sabbath; and everything was found exactly at the place they had indicated. No one could read and understand the writing; but the two nuns who had attested their presence read it one after the other, word for word, and explained it in agreement with each other. \[Page 203\]

In all these things deception lay very near, and it is obvious that all these results are utterly worthless, if one did not employ all prudence to exclude the possibility of fraud. Let us see how it was handled in this regard. The next suspicion that had to arise was naturally: that the possessed, who descended into the pit to bring the hidden thing to light, had themselves carried it down with them. The appeal to their simplicity, education, and conscientiousness could here give no sure guarantee; because all that became invalid in the paroxysm. Therefore, before they descended into the pit, for greater security, they were most strictly searched by other sensible, prudent nuns of good judgment, and moreover unmolested by the spirits. With them other thoughtful persons, clerics and doctors, descended into the trench, who kept them sharply under watch, and never permitted them to come near the place where the amulets were hidden. One was accustomed to give the searchers a pole with a hook into their hand; and all had to remain at a distance from the spot as far as the pole reached, and to bring the magic to light from there with the point of the hook.

More than that, the edge of the trench was lined with other people who paid very close attention to the hands and all the movements of the possessed woman, and who would not easily have missed any practiced deception. It was advantageous that the time of discovery always fell at night; for now many torches were lit, which, properly distributed, mutually dispelled all shadows on the walls of the pit; so that everything stood in full light, which would not have been achievable by day. The Bishop of Embrun, who was present everywhere, moreover had the Most Blessed Sacrament held over the heads of the exorcised possessed woman in the pit at the decisive moment; in order to strike down any deceit also through the terrors of sacrilege. Despite all this caution, the result was always the same: the possessed woman dug up the earth at the indicated spot with her lance; the paper in which the charm was wrapped then became visible in its whiteness through a kind of glow; but it immediately clouded when touched by the air, and became dirty, moldy, and unsightly. But the possessed woman, in the instant when she perceived the hidden thing, was cast backward as if struck by a thunderbolt, uttered a terrible scream, and the spirits howled and roared out of her like wolves and tigers. \[Page 204\]

Since all these precautionary measures that had been taken still did not fully dispel every doubt, as long as the nuns descended into the pit; the method of procedure was also changed in this respect when searching for the last three talismans. The one buried under the choir door was exhumed on 15 December 1645, and two others in the Loreto chapel on 3 January; so that the possessed woman, kept far from the edge of the trench, indicated the spot from outside with a 15-foot-long pole, where the buried item was then found, without the finder ever approaching it. The last one was likewise indicated by the possessed woman from outside the trench, with her face turned away; as she thrust the pole into the earth at one spot, and then ordered them to dig further. From time to time she then called out: One moment more! At last she made a violent thrust, always with her face turned away; and immediately the little package came to light, two finger-breadths from the tip of her pole. Skepticism now had to yield to the evidence of the facts, and the commissioners, sent on behalf of the queen and the council of state, with the Archbishop of Toulouse at their head, issued an authentic testimony as to with what caution and deliberation the proceedings had been conducted in their presence; how they had placed the searching nun between them, and how the paper, white and intact at the first finding, had become moldy, dissolved, and dirty under their eyes.

And yet, despite all this praiseworthy caution, deceptions may have slipped in among them; not exactly such as were consciously devised and carried out by the girls, but begun in the paroxysm under the impulsion of the power possessing them, and completed with the skill that then entered in. The voices called out from the possessed women several times during the whole search: I will play a trick on you! I assure you, you are being fooled! In the case of one who had thus called out, the outcome seemed indeed to confirm the warning. She had indicated a spot with her 12-foot rod; they searched and could find nothing. They therefore emptied a portion of the earth at the bishop's feet to examine it; the bishop held the hands of the possessed woman in his own. She claimed that the sought-after item was in this earth, and threw herself upon it; now, after she had searched for some time, some of those present saw the charm under the little fingers of her hands, and thought that she had rather trickily carried it into the pile.

One sees truth and lies border in these realms so closely upon one another that they falsify and mingle with each other mutually, and a hair-sharp separation of the two becomes nearly impossible. What, however, emerges in all these attempts is a result that, given all that has gone before, can by no means surprise us. As natural stimulants pass unnoticed over life tuned to the middle average temperature, but touch the more tender resonating part most strongly; so too will it be arranged in like manner with the stimulants of a higher kind, and their relation to the higher spirituality. As the rhabdomancer thus feels out the metals and salts in the bosom of the earth; so too does the possessed one harbor the same excitability for the magic stimulants to which precisely his condition appears tied; and this will make all the narrated events fully explainable to us.

#### C. The Spiritual Possession

\[Page 205\]

The curse that rests upon the head of the favored ones in the nocturnal regions acts like the rigid, staring gaze of the serpent upon the mobile nature of the birds; fettering, bewitching, banishing, and then drawing into itself. It thus forms a whirl around itself, and whoever falls into this whirlpool is driven about and swallowed down like the ship in the maw of the sea; whereby those artificial magic stimulants act subsidiarily, like magnets, to strengthen and heighten the pull. The consequence of being bound in this magic circle is now the state of obsession, in which the tightly held grasp of the relations binds all the entangled ones into a real community of fellowship. This state usually leads in gradually through a whole series of visions, apparitions, and ghostly occurrences, in many intermediate stages; which, increasing gradually, finally bring about the height of the enchantment. This gradual increase was quite strikingly noticeable in the convent of Louviers. It began with the Sister Barbe de St. Michael beholding, several times at night, in her cell a great number of lights kindled, and soon she herself could not take three steps without her knee being violently struck against the ground, until at last she fell to the earth.

When she and some others, who afterward came into the same state with her, went to Communion; then they saw the grating toward the church illuminated with torches, but pursued by all sorts of phantoms, which, after frightening them greatly, flew off through the chimney. At the same time one saw bowls and pots falling in the kitchen without anyone touching them. To Sister Maria de St. Nicolas came a phantom in the form of Picard, at about the time of sunrise, sat upon her bed, and spoke to her; while at another time, amid great noise, all sorts of utensils were overturned around her. Upon the Sister of St. Laurent it came from the heel, and made her fall often; but soon it climbed up to the head, so that henceforth severe headache alternated with the ailment in the foot. Still more strongly was Sister Anna de la Nativité disturbed. She saw a phantom in terrible forms that stood motionless before her the whole night in her cell; if she went anywhere, it hurried ahead of her; in the choir it performed all sorts of juggling tricks before her to amuse her; and threatened her fiercely when she discovered the matter to the superior, who advised her to treat all the spook with contempt. At the time when she performed any act of humility and renunciation, the form fled; but upon returning, made what had happened ridiculous. During Mass it gaped its maw against the assembled, and threatened to devour them; set naked people before her, and sometimes struck them hard as well. Once during the Preface there appeared to her a crucifix, from which a voice declared itself to be her husband, promised her his protection, freed an arm to embrace her, and recommended to her only to keep their relationship secret. \[Page 206\]

Since she did not answer at all, the apparition finally vanished amid great noise. Against these temptations she held a nine-day prayer before the Holy Virgin. Then an exceedingly bright-shining sun appeared before her, and the voice brought forth the same language from her, gave her sweet words of love, and urged her to union with the eternal light. Since she did not consent, the voice first fell silent; then later the glow also went out, when she made the sign of the cross against the illusion. The apparition soon returned in the form of other sisters and the superior; during the fast she saw meat dishes in abundance, smelled the odor of flesh everywhere, and men were there who urged her to seize them. Then followed violent convulsions and rigidities that pressed her hard; and the superior found her several times lying on the ground, stiff as wood.

During a service in the choir, her breviary was thrown from her four or five times without her moving her arm, and during the prayer she herself was thrust forward. When she once came out of herself, her sandals were tied without her moving; her rule was torn from her sleeve and thrown away, sometimes all the way over the altar; and the same happened with her rosary. Another time, in the presence of the superior, this rule was hurled into the middle of the fire; the superior quickly pulled it out again, and found it not damaged, although it had lain in the flames long enough. Another time, her relics were torn from her neck; the superior fastened them with three knots in the name of the Trinity, and the confessor forbade them to be torn away any further. It did not happen anymore; but from then on she was more often strangled at the girdle. When she sang with the others in the choir, she was often lifted a cubit high; and when others, to prevent this, placed their feet on hers, they felt these themselves lifted. Finally the spirit came in the form of the Holy Virgin, confirming all earlier apparitions as if they had come from her Son, and repeatedly demanding silence from her. \[Page 207\]

She had to overcome some reluctance, also to disclose this to her superiors; and on account of her fear, two sisters were assigned to her at night with a burning lamp. But the lights were repeatedly blown out, the utensils thrown into disorder, and the beds shaken for so long until the light was relit. With Sister Maria of the Holy Spirit it was done in the same way, the same noise and throwing and falling surrounded her; three nights in a row circles were made before her, and she heard the words: When we are finished, then we have you at the right point! When she knelt at Christmas before the exposed Sacrament, reflected on her life, and offered herself to the Lord, suddenly a horror in the spirit came over her; blasphemous ideas rose up in her, and she no longer dared to look up at the Sacrament; for she saw there things that the human mind cannot bear. In the following night she felt a heaviness that laid itself three times upon her head; then she lost her senses, and could neither speak nor move herself. Thereupon two phantoms appeared to her, one large, which seated itself in a chair; the other dwarfish, only a cubit high, which settled on her stomach; both spoke with each other as if the whole convent, and she herself also, belonged to them. Meanwhile she lay under her alp unconscious, and could not bring forth her usual saying: Et verbum caro factum est! although the two constantly mocked her to do so. But what was most remarkable of all on this occasion was what happened with Sister Maria of the Holy Sacrament, and what she herself recorded. The event began with that touch at the pit of the heart, which her Picard, as we have mentioned earlier, had made.

When I had gone to bed in the evening after nine o'clock, she recounts, three strong fire sparks fell from the ceiling onto the bedcover, such that I had great fear on account of it. When I once imposed the discipline upon myself, the scourge was snatched from my hand and thrown into my face; a light was blown out for me in the attic, and I was seized by the girdle and thrown down the stairs. Another time a heavy mass was laid upon my shoulders, such that I thought I would suffocate; when I dragged myself with difficulty to the worthy Mother, I felt how the mass tumbled down onto a step of the stairs with a great crash; but I was thrown down at the same time, such that blood gushed forth from my mouth and nose. I was to ask fearlessly, if it returned: Who are you, what do you want here, and why do you turn to me?

When therefore I again one night around 11 o'clock heard a confused noise, I spoke the words. A terrible voice said: My sister, I have a secret to entrust to you! I cried out in horror; people came running, and still heard the sound of a blow that I received. The following night the spirit came in the form of a deceased convent sister, begging for certain prayers for the comfort of her soul, which however the confessor forbade in the prescribed form, allowing me some other devotional exercises. After some days a voice came, as if from a flash of lightning, thanking me for what I had done; I took it for the voice of the soul that I had freed, and formed a good opinion of myself. \[Page 208\]

Several apparitions in various forms followed, some very frightful; and I was plagued in every way. Once my signature was tricked from me for a paper that was supposed to be a creed; in truth however, as it was later read to me, it contained all imaginable blasphemies. Again it came to me in the form of a convent sister who was my friend, who now brought me roses and carnations; then again struck, bit, and scratched me. One night I saw a young, naked man standing before me; I made the sign of the cross against it, and sprinkled holy water; but the form only mocked me. I, holding it for a ghost, then went toward it; but when I noticed that it did not vanish, I cried out with all my strength. The worthy Mother came running, asked what was the matter with me; but I only kept crying, holding fast to the form, which dragged me to the chimney, and in doing so lifted me two feet high. I feared being dragged out of the convent thereby, let go on that account, and now fell to the ground; where they found me, my hands full of black, reddish-glinting, stinking ointment.

They cleansed me of the filth, and then threw the cloth into the fire. The confessor now ordered that one of the older sisters go to me from time to time, to see how I was each time. But if this one omitted it once, then the demon came in her form, flattered itself into my trust; and as I gradually placed some faith in the deceiving words, and confided my perplexity amid the many apparitions to the seeming figure, this one advised me: no longer to entrust myself to people, nor to appear before my superiors, confessor, and directors; God would lead me by his own ways, to him alone must I turn my whole trust. In later meetings the form then let itself be drawn into various teachings, which amounted to this: all flesh is like hay; the Lord had therefore taken it upon himself, not to honor it, but to make it contemptible to us through the assumption of so many mistreatments. For that reason he had also reproved his apostles that through too great attachment to his humanity they had become unreceptive to the spirit.

For his true worshippers worship God in spirit and in truth; only the carnal ones have made the body into a sacrament for themselves, which they now adore; whereas the divine Majesty abhors flesh and blood. She then declared herself with equal definiteness against another life; hell is an invention of men, who knew no other way to maintain order here below. The true hell is rather on earth in the midst of men, and there also paradise is to be found; it is therefore a great folly to give up a present good for a fantastical hope that will never be fulfilled; for the soul must die with the body, otherwise God would have spoken untruth when he said: Thou shalt surely die. \[Page 209\]

I became wholly confused, and at last told it to my confessor; and now the apparition sought, in my opinion, to ruin this one too, by appearing one morning in his form in my cell, and making me a formal declaration of love. Amidst my horror at this, doubts yet arose in me again, and I drove him away with the sign of the cross. The apparition came likewise another time in his form to the speaking grille, until the arrival of the real one drove it away. The spirit then made me believe that the confessor handed me a magic potion in the host of the sacrament every time; as a sign of this I should pay attention, and I would find it marked red every time. I now looked more closely indeed, and beheld on it as he had told me. Another time the hosts appeared to me half-blackened, and only the firm conviction of the confessor's spotless virtue could destroy this illusion for me.

Now the matter took another turn. One day in the early morning, a glow like that of a summer dawn illuminated my cell; and a beautiful youth of fifteen or sixteen years appeared to me in it, who greeted me graciously, saying: he was sent to me for my protection, because I had found grace before God, who had been pleased with what I had done hitherto. But he wanted now to lead me further on his ways, and had sent him to me for that purpose. For this, it was first of all necessary that I trust in him alone; for men, since their fall, have taken ignorance, mortality, and bestiality into themselves, and now one blind man would lead another. Silence and secrecy is therefore the first thing he demands of thee; for thou canst not serve two masters, and where God's Majesty is active, the reason of man must stand aside. Say therefore, like the mother of the Savior: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word! and henceforth ask no more at the high priest of the law.

The conversation lasted three hours; I had weighed everything carefully, and found nothing suspicious; he truly seemed to me to be my guardian angel, and I thanked God in full joy, for that day I felt no temptation. On the following day his discourse turned to the predestination of God; how he chooses his brides, and leads them on unusual paths, and allows them not the smallest thought of infidelity, which I therefore must combat even as it arises. Then for three days in succession it was spoken of the essence of God, and of the nature of men, who were created in the image of the angels---who themselves are images of God---but have defiled this image, and now wrongly call themselves fathers, masters, and doctors, and true Christians; whereas God, as Christ has said, should alone be called Father. In the sixth conference it was set forth how God created the angels from his essence, who, being of like nature with him, are also bound in perfect union with his substance. The two conferences next following spread themselves over the diversity of opinions and the disunity among men; for which God therefore sent his own Son, to bring them back to obedience. \[Page 210\]

Gabriel was there the bringer of the commandments of the Most High, and since he found her willing, he entered into her, and incarnated himself in her body; therefore he is the one whom men call the Redeemer of the world. I too should arm myself with prayer to receive the approaching Bridegroom. At the now following return, he asked me: whether I was now resolved to serve God in utmost perfection and renunciation. I replied: how I had therefore left the world to serve God; body and soul stood without reservation at his service. He praised me for it, and I felt such comfort and longing to be pleasing to God that I could scarcely bear it. He said now: Permit me to touch your heart, to strengthen it, and to fix it in this love.

At these words a kind of fear came over me, and I laid my hands on my breast: Know that before my confessor I have made a resolution to permit no one, whoever it may be, any touching! He said: he had done it only for my testing; but I replied: If it is God's will, then do it, otherwise I can never will it! I saw his countenance change, he seemed angry, yet without his splendor being diminished. He touched me, and said: that I was wrong to doubt him. For the tenth time he came shining brighter than ever before, to cleanse me, as he said, from my imperfections. He touched my heart, but in all chastity, and no evil thought arose in me, only a longing to love God; and I truly held him to be my good angel.

At his eleventh visit he asked me what I had, because I showed some unrest; I confessed to him at last that I had been in temptation the whole day to disclose the matter to my confessor. He reproved me for it, and said: Give me your tongue, that I may touch it and strengthen it. I could not help telling him: that all these touchings of his highly displeased me; because they seemed to me unsuitable for a spirit. He replied: You must mortify your own judgment even more strongly, for you will only your own will, and not that of the Lord! So do then, I replied, what pleases God's Majesty; he touched, however, only after a long speech on submission to God's will, my tongue. In the morning he came earlier than usual, in the full splendor of his beauty, and spoke so movingly of the glory of the blessed that my heart was ravished; and he, after touching my heart and eyes, had to keep his hand on the former to give me strength. They found me as if out of my senses, the whole day I could scarcely hold myself; and since I reproached myself for it: as if I sought only my own comfort in the All, and therefore grasped the nettles, and gave myself a hard discipline; he fully approved at evening what I had done. \[Page 211\]

He returned in the morning, an exceedingly beautiful rose in his hand, which he offered me. But I covered my face, beseeching him: that he might moderate his all too great splendor, because I could not bear it. He touched my eyes and heart, I took the rose and kissed it; but he spoke to me of the immortality of the soul, and how only one man had been immortal, because without sin; since sin makes the spirit mortal, as the body is. I rejoiced over all these speeches, and my better knowledge before other men, and attributed it to my unceasing zeal to serve God. In the evening I had withdrawn to my cell, and prayed to God: that he, if the form was my good angel, might let it appear to me now for my comfort; but not permit that I be deceitfully led astray. He was immediately present, and after some exchanges of words I said to him: O you who are so good, and will the peace of souls, disclose yet to my confessor or to one of my superiors the relation that exists between us, so that I may find full peace!

He replied: the most beautiful gift that he could bestow upon me was my complete seclusion from all fellowship with men. In doing so, he touched my heart: "See," he said, "this is the seat of the passions; but you feel none at the touch, for I purify and sanctify all that approaches me in simplicity and faithfulness of heart." In the fourteenth meeting, he spoke to me of God and the fall of the angels, which had occurred only because, through lack of steadfastness and trust in their will, they had moved unstably; and thereby stepped out of their union with God, the highest bliss, to which they, as intelligences whom God had not called forth from nothing but from his own essence, had been predestined. All this was said so beautifully and compellingly that I cannot reproduce it, yet some apprehension always lingered in the background for me; so that when he demanded a pledge of fidelity from me, I always replied: "If God so wills!" or: "I have placed God in full possession of my heart!"

The next day, after Communion, a great dryness had come over me, and I complained of it to him. He said: he had imposed it upon me for my testing, and to draw me away from all earthly things; and then he asked me three times in succession, with a sweet voice: "My daughter! my beloved! do you love me?" Each time I lost the use of my senses; he had to bring me back to myself by touching me, and then he vanished with the words: "Three more days, and you shall be forever established in my grace." After the next Communion, the same sadness and aridity returned, and I withdrew quickly into my cell. My spirit soon visited me again and reproached me for my weakness in bearing my trial; nothing on this earth is won without effort. Finally, on the last day, when he came and inquired about the state of my inner self, I said to him: nothing troubles me at present, for I have come to full resignation in God's will; although, whatever I may undertake, I cannot master a certain fear of possible deception. Yet I promise, if nothing contrary to God arises in me, deep silence. He approved of all this, and spoke to me ravishingly of the joys that awaited me. \[Page 212\]

In the evening, the confessor had me summoned to the speaking grille; I went with reluctance. When I appeared, he asked me: how things stood with me, and what was passing within me? I answered: things stood well, and only good passed within me! He, in turn: "So something is indeed passing in you, and I want to know what it is!" "Jesus! my father," I said, "if something were passing between God and me, I would be bound to disclose it! For the left hand should know nothing of the good that the right hand does." He now commanded me, upon holy obedience, to tell him what I wished to conceal; and I said: nothing except that I had come to a full indifference toward all creatures. He found this well done, but warned me to be on my guard; lest under the pretext of the good I be led into evil. "But," I said, "my father! is there something in my behavior that perhaps arouses suspicion?" "I have no suspicion," was the reply, "but rather fear of deception; your fainting spells after holy Communion, the sadness on your face, your silence about the state of your conscience for fifteen days or three weeks, make me believe that something is the matter with you." "Truly!" I replied, "for some time now I have been withdrawing from men, because true consolation is only with God; from men, however, only hindrance comes." "Well!" he said, "I believe you, my daughter, and I pray to God that he may let you recognize the truth, so that you may not be deceived, and that all may end to his glory!"

I looked at him without saying a word, for I did not know what I should do; but I thought to myself: this is a temptation, for I have today pledged fidelity and silence. He, noticing my uncertainty, said: I see well that you do have something to share with me after all! No, I replied, I am only pondering the words I have heard, and at the same time I rose to leave. When I was in the middle of the parlor, I stopped to consider what I should do. He called me back: My daughter! I beg you, tell me the truth---that was his address; do you perhaps have some fear? I fear no one but God, was my answer. Then go on your way, I believe you! When I was near the door, I turned toward him and said: Farewell, my father! He in turn: Farewell, my daughter! I kept looking at him, and said once more: Farewell, my father! I am going now. He called me back yet again: My daughter! one more little word; come closer, I will tell it to you softly. I approached the speaking grille, and he gently took hold of the cord with which I was girded, and said to me: I see clearly that you have something to share with me; I will not let you go now until you have spoken the word to me, even if I should not depart from here until tomorrow! \[Page 213\]

I was greatly astonished, and said: It is true, my father! something extraordinary is taking place between me and my good angel. God imparts many graces to me through him; but I cannot speak of all this, because I have pledged fidelity and silence, and I fear otherwise to lose the consolation of his visits. The confessor replied to these words: In truth, my daughter! this angel is the devil himself! An immense trembling seized my whole body, my teeth chattered against each other so that I could not speak. The confessor spoke prayers and exorcisms over me, and in the end had to summon the worthy mother to my assistance. The trembling lasted perhaps half an hour; when it had passed, the father wanted me to abjure all the words of agreement and affection that I might have spoken. I replied: as I renounce everything that I might have said contrary to God's will. But he would not be satisfied with that; I was to renounce the angel entirely and regard him as a devil; I, however, refused to proceed further that day, saying that one must first see what the matter truly was. I promised him in this that I would faithfully report the further outcome. He handed me over to the sister with the charge: not to leave me until she had brought me to bed.

I, when I was alone, spoke words of courage to myself, and when all in the convent had become quiet, he came in his clarity; but with an expression of such raging anger as if he wished to destroy me. He reproached me as unfaithful, ungrateful, wretched; I knew not what misfortune awaited me; only repentance and a solemn vow of greater fidelity for the future could save me. He looked at me with a piercing, loving gaze: Promise me, he cried, only better fidelity for the future, and I will forgive your weakness! I felt a great tenderness toward him, but at the same time a fear of giving my consent, and without answering, I turned to the other side. But he immediately turned me back, and said: What is this, my daughter? How changed you are! Do you not wish me to take possession of your heart? I replied: This heart belongs to God alone; I do not regret what I did earlier in the confessional. If you are from God, then it will also be pleasing to you; but if you wish to remove all suspicion from me, appear before the confessor at the speaking grille in your full clarity, and reveal to him what you have undertaken for my guidance. If he approves everything and declares you to be an angel of God, then I promise you unwavering fidelity; if not, then leave off from me, unworthy as I am. \[Page 214\]

With every word that I spoke, the expression on his face changed; at last he became furious, and losing all composure, he said: Wretch! Is this the fulfillment of your promise from yesterday? What have you noticed in me since then that is hateful to God? I see, I have shown you too much love, you have turned the medicine into poison; once more, do not force me, after so much mildness, to turn to severity against you! I was so moved that it was a close thing---I would have agreed. But I said: Even if I promise you fidelity, I cannot keep it; the confessor will question me, and for all the world I will not deceive him. Give me only your heart, he said, and I will manage it somehow. My heart belongs to God, I cried out; I renounce you, wretched deceiver! Now I see, you are not from God, and I despise your flattering words and threats. Ha, unhappy one! With this word I deliver you to your enemy, as punishment for you! With that he vanished. That was on April 4, 1642; splendor and glory were gone, and from then on he returned to her armed only with all terrors.

Nächtliche cross and zigzag wanderings, one will say, of a nun dancing about in the garden of love, who by day, through cloister and rule, saw herself excluded from entering the enchanted gardens, and now in the silence of the night recovered from her harm. The confessor was the lord and master of the waking world that surrounded her; and in her prose, her asceticism, her penances and her constraints he kept her enclosed. But when she had sunk into the arms of sleep in her solitary cell, then the poetess awoke within her; the alleged angel was the lord of the new dream world; he touched her creative imagination with a glowing finger, and this then gave birth to the extravagant images in which she reveled, entirely forgetting the troubles of waking states. But soon a strife arose between the two realms, for the master of prose and the master of poetry could not in the long run get along under one roof. The mother of the nun had cried out, at that time when the goddess-mother Isis had tried to burn out the daughter, purifying her in her flames.

The master of prose was crude; by her girdle he drew the reluctant one down into his phlegm. In the sinking down, her inner being was transformed; the genius of gentle beauty turned for her, in frightful fashion, into a terrible demon; the idyllic drama, since the tragic element had veered into the comic, was translated into a baroque parody of itself---that is, she became possessed as punishment for her fall; with a different outcome, the monk would have become a Philistine, just as the peasants who had blasphemed Latona were transformed into frogs. --- \[Page 215\]

All this sounds round and witty; but it fits only poorly with the dubious barter between the two regions. This alleged dream world finds itself, below and to the side, built around and framed by the waking world; and of the arabesques that traverse it, a part does indeed take root, in its plant-like half, in sobriety, and only the winged spirits in the flower calyces grow over into the enclosed realm. For just as the strong, encroaching color in the eye awakens its complementary color; so one may assume that the imagination complements the prose of life with poetry awakened from within, in contrast. But these poetic dreams and foams have at other times entered very tangibly into life; and one cannot deny that the plant-like then took root in the dream world, but the marvelous, which had blossomed above, was carried out into the waking world. When the possessions broke out in the cloister, and the Bishop of Evreux Picard, proceeding thither in a six-horse carriage; the possessed nuns came, who knew how to run swiftly like the wind over the roofs and the walls, and who walked over the waters without sinking, nimbly towards him, threw themselves between the horses, and it succeeded for them more than once to halt the carriage.

Was that perhaps also a dream which the horses had dreamed? When in the choir the breviaries and order rules of the tormented flew about, desks and utensils were overturned at their approach; when their sandals hung on their veils; when at dead of night a murmur of many voices arose around them; when the dreaming Marie herself was thrown down the stairs: were all these wondrous things perhaps dreams that had escaped from the dream-world into the waking world? When the same Marie once, in the presence of witnesses, ran with impetuosity up a mulberry tree to its outermost tender summit branches, and now from branch to branch circled and flew around the tree like a bird; did the tree that had borne this wondrous fruit stand in the open cloister garden, or in the nun's cell behind the dream portal? Thus the truth that has fallen from waking into the alleged world of illusion stands opposed by another, which has stepped forth from this world of illusion into the real; each of the two thus has a root of truth within itself, and they are therefore placed on equal footing with one another. \[Page 216\]

This equal validity of both spheres, and the complete parallelism in their effects, utterly inexplicable under the presupposition that the one is merely the negation of the other; explains itself readily if one lays beneath them a double ground of truth, an inner and an outer. Then arises a state which takes its first origin from certain mediating personalities, here that of Picard. Its genesis, and the gradual development of the symptoms in both directions, we have seen pass before us in what has gone before. If on this path it has reached its height, then it ends at last in that possession which calls forth voices from the inner realm, named the spiritual obsession. Sixteen or eighteen nuns of the convent were in this state. They were, shaken by the most violent convulsions, rolled into balls, twisted in the strangest contortions; but the doctors were astonished to find them, amid all this, in perfect health, and after three to four hours of paroxysms of the most violent kind their pulse was mostly unmoved and calm. They declared unanimously: it is impossible to explain such violent, prolonged, frequently recurring attacks, which leave no trace after their passing, by mere natural forces. For four to five years the thus affected ones were tormented day and night; for two years during the exorcisms they were for many hours at a stretch in raging, howling, screaming, and convulsions; moreover they felt the movement of their spirits often, so that they were for 6--8 hours of the day in the most terrifying excitement: but when the attack or the exorcism ceased, and the stole had scarcely been removed; then they went away dancing and laughing, without a sign of fatigue, and without after-effects.

### Chapter 2. Psychic Reports

The spiritual reports connect the personalities with one another in their midpoints, and with the center of the radical evil; the psychic ones continue the begun work then in the middle man. The psyche, which with a spiritual one gives itself to the spirit, with a vital one to vitality, has, although both moments properly belong to it, yet in them tinged itself with the color and manner of the two regions into which it has thus inserted itself, and which have given themselves to it through it.

But she herself entirely, in her specific particularity, is she only in her middle moment, in that wherein she reveals herself outwardly, in every kind of voluntary movement. Where, therefore, a short and compact intuition is in question, this movement can be taken as her most proper expression, and as the medium in which her essence and her manner inscribes itself in the purest and most compact form, and from which her properties and inner relations can again be derived. In the movement expresses itself the higher will, within a certain, precisely psychical limitation; and its inhibitions and morbidities make themselves felt in it, just as one feels in the pulse the disturbances of physical life. This thus regulating will stands now, first, in a determinate relation to itself, and then in another to the surrounding nature and its forces, divides itself therefore into a subjective and an objective. \[Page 217\]

Since now the movement is the expression of the in- dwelling inner, so will it also divide itself into a purely voluntary one, and one of mixed kind, a so-called in- voluntary; and from the natural relations of both kinds will the power and freedom of the total will in this domain be dependent. The relation adequate to the ordinary conditions of life can now be disturbed: either by the one subjective moment, in that this once claims too much for itself, and seeks to emancipate itself entirely from all involuntary movement; or in that it surrenders itself too much to the other, so that the involuntary, overflowing its banks, threatens to master the whole. There then arises a possession of this will immediately through nature, or mediately through itself; which will appear as a work of guilt, and thus as an obsession. Or the natural relation is disturbed by the other involuntary moment: which either, overwhelmed by positive natural forces, breaks over into the domain of voluntary movements; or, yielding itself too much to the negative, calls forth the irruption of these movements. In both cases it is a natural possession, which, as a work of contagion, is a misfortune and a disease. To this belong therefore the rigid spasms, the St. Vitus' dances, and the over- tensions of the movement-systems in all kinds of manias, which are mostly at the same time connected with deeper natural intuitions, in the activities pointing toward the purpose.

With such intuitions, however, the view into the otherwise closed spirit-realm is also opened, and there a second relation of the psychical will-forces to the powers native there makes itself known. This relation, however, forms itself now either in the involuntary will-forces: those powers master these forces, and pave their way through them to the other order of subjectively voluntary forces, which they, binding to unfree ones, to evil purposes immediately or in the back-effect of the loosed, press toward. Then the demonic ob- session will emerge as disease; whereas conversely, if the outset comes from the voluntary will-forces, and these smooth the paths for the evil, and prepare the ways for it, that demonic obsession enters, which as guilt intervenes more deeply.

The first kind of obsession, if it finds many individuals in similar situations, in determinate rapports toward one another, and toward the contagious demonic miasma placed, can therefore spread itself epidemically over all; and the same power will seize it in those rapports and bind it to its center. They all will therefore, infected by the same possession, form around it a group of their own; and a demonic epidemic, spread more narrowly or more widely, will then emerge. The other kind of obsession likewise, when it arises either in an individual of superior powers, who knows how to draw strongly to himself, through his relations, as the center of an entire sphere, those belonging to it whom he has won over by means of these relations; or when it otherwise arises simultaneously in several individual personalities who are capable of forming such a nucleus; will likewise become epidemic, and thus can bring forth an entire circle, not without the complicity of the possessed. This epidemic of obsession, intermingled in the personal contagion of the afflicted, will thus form the second object of our consideration. To the third will then be subordinated the cases of mixed kind and doubtful nature.

#### A. The Psychic Symptoms of Possession

\[Page 218\]

Such evils will, as is easily recognized, occur for the most part there where many persons, under similar influences, in similar circumstances of life, live in close contact with one another; most of all, when they are individuals of the female sex, who already in themselves stand in a closer natural union with the men. Female convents will thus first be the scenes of such occurrences, and indeed there is no lack of examples where such things have taken place in such conventual associations. Among these cases there is especially one that was exactly and sharply observed by four bishops and four doctors of the Sorbonne; which they then likewise sharply weighed and discussed in its various circumstances; and concerning which, after they had confirmed the individual facts through repeated experiments, excluded the doubtful, and retained only what was evidently certain, they then drew up the following clear and luminous report, which dispels all suspicion of fraud and deception, and presents the matter roundly and plainly.

It reads, however, as follows: We, the undersigned, after having heard the report made to us by His Episcopal Grace of Châlons-sur-Saône concerning the occurrences that took place in his presence among many persons, some ecclesiastical, some secular, who seemed to be plagued and seized by the evil spirit, in Auxonne; at that time when, by order of the King and on the commission of His Highness the Archbishop of Besançon, he conducted the exorcisms on the spot for fourteen days; after he had called in several priests chosen by him, all persons of great piety and great merit, and moreover assigned to them Mr. Morel, formerly the city physician of Châlons, known for his science and experience; who all agreed in the same judgment concerning the matter, which the aforesaid Lord Bishop presented to us under the following points of view:

First, that all those virgins in their entirety, 18 in number, some secular, some ecclesiastical, and without excepting even one, appeared to him to have the gift of tongues; inasmuch as they always answered correctly to the Latin with which the exorcists addressed them, not from the ritual, and still less by prior agreement. Often they also expressed themselves in Latin, sometimes in whole periods, once or twice through formal speeches. One among them, Anne des Ecolos, called of the Purification, when one of the exorcists spoke Irish to her, testified that she understood him very well, and explained what was said to him several times in the French language. Secondly, that all or nearly all showed that they possessed a knowledge of the interior, and of the secret of thoughts when these were directed toward them; which showed itself especially in the inner commands that the exorcists gave them on many occasions, to which they in general obeyed very exactly, without these commands being translated into words or any external sign; concerning which the Lord Bishop himself made various experiments. \[Page 219\]

Thus among others in the person of Denise Parisot, maid of the General-Lieutenant von Auronne, to whose demon he, in the depths of his thoughts, had directed the command: to come to him, in order to allow himself to be exorcized. She came at once, although she lived in a distant quarter of the city, and said: that she had been commanded to present herself before him; an experiment which repeated itself with her several times. Further in the person of Sister Margaretha Janini, called of the Child Jesus, novice; who, when the exorcism was at an end, recited to him the command which he had imposed on the demon in the course of it. Even more in the person of Humberte Borthon, called of the holy Francis, to whom he, in the midst of her highest agitation, had given the order to prostrate herself at full length before the holy Sacrament with outstretched hands; a command which she fulfilled in the moment of its utterance with extraordinary zeal and great speed. The other clergymen who had been present there, according to his report, since the same thing occurred with them every day, had adopted it as the manner of making them obey, into their practice.

Thirdly, that they on various occasions had foretold future things, especially in regard to the maleficia and sorceries which one must find; not only at various places in the convent, where they were indeed really found; but also in the bodies of other sisters, with whom they had not previously spoken, and who then vomited them forth and expelled them from themselves exactly at the hour which those had determined for them. At times they had told the Holy Bishop, and some of his clergymen, very secret particulars in regard to their household affairs, and the time of his journey to Paris, which he himself had not even known; which things then turned out in truth just as stated, but could neither be guessed nor combined from the circumstances. Fourthly, that nearly all of them, especially at the height of their agitation, had shown a great aversion to all holy things, especially the sacraments of the Eucharist and Penance; so that sometimes on account of the violent resistance and outcries, which could only be subdued by commands directed to the demon, several hours were spent over such a confession.

Before Communion they were seized with convulsions and visibly involuntary movements; as soon as they received the holy Host, they cried out and howled terribly, and rolled on the ground; while the received Host always remained on the tip of the tongue, which they, at the command of the exorcist, stuck out or drew back; without, however, committing any irreverence against the holy Sacrament. This lasted sometimes half an hour, more or less; but when at last the received particle was swallowed, then she who had taken it remained immediately calm, and without remembrance of what had occurred. That further they had felt the most extraordinary aversions and fits of rage, at the approach of the relics of the saints, which they often recognized and named by name, before they had seen them, and without knowing anything of them. That furthermore nearly all, when the holy Bishop several times secretly laid hands on them, and without their being able to know it, had given to understand how they felt it; as they cried out: this hand is unbearable to them, it presses heavily, they would be burned by it! That finally at the height of the exorcism, especially during holy Mass, they had uttered blasphemies, and such frequent and terrible imprecations against God and his holy Mother, that one could not possibly hear them without horror; which, as may be supposed, could only proceed from the mouth of the demon. \[Page 220\]

Fifthly, that, when they were pressed to prove the presence of the demon through supernatural signs, they seemed to comply; among others, the maid Denise Parisot, who, when the Lord Bishop commanded her, caused the pulse of her right arm to stand completely still, while it continued undisturbed on the left; then the beating was transferred from the left to the right, while it now stood still on the left; all of which she executed with the utmost precision in the presence of several clerics and the physician, who examined and confirmed it. That the Sister of the Purification performed the same feat two or three times; both the one and the other in full health, and thus holding or releasing the pulse according to the command of the exorcist. That the Sister Margaretha Janini of the Child Jesus achieved the same, and at the exorcist's bidding inflated her breast to a monstrous height; but when he commanded a halt under the sign of the cross, she immediately caused it to subside: and this three times in succession with an astonishing efficacy, taking effect as rapidly as the word. That the Sister Lazara Arivey, called of the Resurrection, came to one of the clerics; carrying in her hand a coal of considerable length in full glow, without giving any sign of feeling the burn; and so several other effects of a similar nature, which cannot easily be set forth here in detail.

Sixthly, that at the mere command of the exorcist they sometimes fell into a wonderful insensibility; among others, Denise, who, when the Lord Bishop commanded the demon to withhold her senses, and the physician, to whom she expressly declared that she was entirely painless, thrust a needle under the nail of her finger, where, according to her own account, it shows itself most sensitive, immediately stated: that she felt not the slightest thing. When she was commanded: to hold back the blood, the needle was withdrawn without any blood following. But at the command to let it flow, it flowed forth at once in abundance; then holding it back again, when the command to halt was repeated. The same thing recurred a few days later on the person of the Sister of the Purification, whose skin on the arm one had wounded with a needle that was driven into her finger up to its head; without any pain or blood making itself felt, and without the sister appearing ill or faint; she rather always spoke, and urged those present to apply fire and iron, because she felt nothing of any of it. That some among them, especially the Sister of the Purification, when on a night in which, according to the assurance that the others had given the exorcist the day before, she was to be fetched away for the Sabbath, was prevented from leaving the cloister; at the hour of this alleged assembly suddenly fell into a kind of stupor and wonderful insensibility, which lasted five quarters of an hour and longer. All her senses were closed; she lay without movement, without speech, and without self-consciousness; her arms crossed on her breast, and so rigid that it was impossible to pull them apart; her eyes at first closed, and then opened, but held immovably fixed, and without power of sight; as was evident when one passed hands before her, and she did not twitch her eyelids like a dead or entirely insensible person. When she returned from this trance, she recounted: how she had been at the Sabbath in spirit, and all that she had seen there. \[Page 221\]

Seventhly, that they often, after several hours had been spent in conjurations and exorcisms, appeared to vomit up from the bottom of their stomachs certain foreign bodies, which they were accustomed to call maleficia and magic remedies of various kinds: pieces of wax, bones, hairs; besides pebbles of such size---according to our judgment broader and thicker than a silver thaler---so that it seemed difficult to us that they could be driven upward through the throat in a natural way. Finally, that the possessed one, among other things, after three hours of exorcisms and extraordinary exertions, expelled through her mouth a living frog or toad the breadth of a fist, and that the creature was immediately burned.

Eighthly, that the demons, by whom the girls claimed to be possessed, when pressed by the exorcisms to depart, appeared to give supernatural and convincing signs in the vicinity of the Most Holy Sacrament. When the bishop commanded them to depart from the possessed one, and as a sign thereof to break a pane which he indicated with his finger, the pane was broken. That Sister Humberthe Borthon was found completely and entirely healed on the day of the Presentation of the Virgin in 1661; and as a sign of her deliverance she vomited through her mouth a folded piece of taffeta, upon which in red script the name of Mary was written, and four other initial letters signifying St. Hubert and the blessed Francis de Sales. That the sister named of the Purification had been freed from several demons on the day of St. Gregory the Wonderworker; and as a sign thereof she gave forth through her mouth a piece of cloth in a circle of copper, upon which the name Gregory was written; and that the same one, on that same day of the Presentation, as a sign of another deliverance from several demons, caused the words Jesus, Mary, Joseph to appear in large letters, as if written with blood, on her bandage in an instant; while the exorcists had seen the bandage entirely white just a moment before.

Ninthly, that among the violent movements and postures which they made during the exorcism, some appeared so extraordinary that one had to judge they exceeded the strength of a girl; indeed, the powers of nature. That Sister Borthon, when commanded to adore the Most Holy Sacrament, threw herself to the ground, touching it only with the tip of her belly over the stomach; but with her head, feet, and hands, as well as the rest of her body, directed into the air. That the sister of the Resurrection practiced the same, and sometimes lay thus with her body bent into a circle; so that her soles touched her forehead. That Constantia and the possessed one were sometimes seen thrown to the ground, touching it only with the crown of the head and the feet, the entire rest of the body in the air, and that they walked about in this state. That all or nearly all, when they lay on their knees with their arms crossed over the stomach, turned themselves backward; so that the crown of the head connected with the soles of the feet, but the mouth kissed the earth, and with the tongue traced the sign of the cross on the ground. That some, among others Sister Catherine, during the exorcism appeared with the head thrown back, the eyes open; yet in such a way that, as the pupil was entirely hidden under the upper eyelid, one saw only the white in the eye, whereby she probably had lost the power of sight; an appearance that had been frightful to behold. That the possessed one, who was young and weak in appearance, when she was in agitation, with two fingers threw to the ground a vessel of a kind of marble, filled with holy water, and so heavy that two exceedingly strong persons would have had difficulty lifting it and removing it from its pedestal, with an ease that she might have used for a small stone. \[Page 222\]

That it has often happened to some and to others, in the heat of their attacks, to dash their heads against the wall or the ground; sometimes with such violent and hard blows that, in the natural order of things, they must have severely injured themselves with bloodshed; but that neither contusion, nor wound, nor any sign thereof appeared. Tenthly, that all these girls are of diverse stations: secular, novices, postulants, professed; further, young and more advanced in years; some from the city, others not; some of good and some of lowly origin; poor and rich; that this misfortune has already begun in the convent for ten years and more; that it is scarcely conceivable how, in so long a time, a scheme of deceit and subterfuge, among so many girls of such diverse dispositions and opposing interests, could have remained undiscovered; that in a sharp investigation and precise inquiry, the Lord Bishop found no one, whether in the convent or in the city, who did not speak to him most favorably of the innocence and blamelessness, both of the virgins and of the clerics who had worked before him in the exorcisms; and he testifies on his part that he recognized them in their conduct as exemplary, deserving, and pious persons: a testimony which he believes himself obliged to give in duty to truth and justice. To all this added the testimony of Mr. Morel, the physician, who was present at everything, and who assures that all these things surpass the bounds of nature, and can only proceed from the demon; so we believe, having weighed everything well, that all these extraordinary facts in those virgins go beyond the powers of human nature, and can only be wrought by the demon, who possesses and besets their bodies. That is our opinion. Given in Paris on the 20th of January 1662.

One sees with what circumspection these men proceeded, examining and weighing everything carefully; and we shall see who will have the forehead to contradict their testimony, and to declare respectable men as deceivers, or as deceived by the juggling tricks of the companions of a convent and its conniving spiritual directors, continued for more than ten years, whose good reputation is secured by the testimony of an entire city. But assuming the event to be true, since no one was found upon whom any suspicion of bewitchment rested, the evil must therefore have arisen within the convent itself through immediate communication, either simultaneously in all, or also in one or more, and then passed from one to the other through epidemic contagion; until finally the entire community was seized. Since they drew it upon themselves on the Sabbath, it has been a true obsession that overtook them; but since none among them was found from whom one could truly have suspected that she had first given occasion to the evil through her own fault; it has therefore come upon them as a judgment, and it has been an obsession that yet again emerged in all the forms of a possession; which therefore here proceeded from a source of contagion lying entirely outside the circle of the human realm. \[Page 223\]

Such obsessions differ, except for the Sabbath, in none of the other phenomena from those which the possessions exhibit; but they are at the same time, except for goal and intention, otherwise in all things equal to the symptoms of higher ecstasies. The gift of languages, the beholding of another's thoughts, the hearing of the commands of the exorcist from afar, the knowledge of holy things, of the sacraments, of relics and consecrations, here expressing itself as loathing and horror, the power of the will over the unfree ganglionic life, invulnerability to fire, painlessness and closure of the senses, the stopping and flowing of the blood at will, the drawing in of the whole body into the form of a circle, or successively into the forms of two half-circles divided from one another and turned toward each other: all of this we have already seen mutatis mutandis in the saints just as well. That circle which the one formed would, had the exorcist so willed, have rolled itself just as much in the circular streaming of the forces, toward any arbitrary point on the radial line; as the holy Peter of Alcántara did it voluntarily in his ecstasies toward the Most Holy Sacrament.

These events are proven in the saints by the most unimpeachable testimonies; they are proven here now in the possessed by equally unimpeachable witnesses; the facts confirm one another just as much, and here as always the devil, so far as it lies in his power, must against his will bear witness for the higher truth. All of this is in nature, for it is executed with natural forces; but it is also above nature, for the ground to which these forces attach themselves lies beyond the region of ordinary life. Next to this, the casting forth of objects designated by certain names seems still to point to jugglery and deception. So much is certainly true: these things did not write themselves, the devil did not write them either; therefore it was the nuns who did it. But they did not do it in waking senses, with the intention of deception, but rather as they were beside themselves, in the properly negative demonic ecstasy; in it they also swallowed the written things, which alone would have been possible in such a state. \[Page 224\]

As the exorcism now called forth a kind of positive, anti-demonic ecstasy, all the movements of the negative ones reversed themselves, thus also the peristaltic movements; and they had to cast forth again what they had previously swallowed down. In all these proceedings, the saint stands to the one under whose obedience he has placed himself, and the possessed to the exorcist, in the same relation as the magnetized stands to the magnetizer; only that this natural relation there passes over into a higher or deeper region of things through intensification, here through depression, according to the positivity or negativity of the exponents. It is otherwise remarkable that the witnesses of this proceeding, who believed in the bodily departure, in the Sabbath, had the departing ones watched at the appointed hour, and now found them as if caught in a vision. The possibility of such a departure in very rare cases is, as we have seen, by no means to be denied; but had the investigators been able to occupy themselves with the matter longer than fourteen days, they would, as can scarcely be doubted, always have found only the vision. What was thus found in Auronne had also earlier been discerned in Louviers. There the Sister du Saint Esprit was possessed by Dagon; this one once wound himself around the girl's body in a threefold coil, like a writhing snake, by twisting the region of the stomach on the body to one side like a loop, the feet to the opposite side, but elongating the head toward the shoulders, so that she had the appearance of a knotted coil of snakes. \[Page 225\]

The same one, when she was once confronted with Bavent, stood with one foot stretched out three shoe-lengths high against the speaking grating; her face pale, emaciated, parched, her eyes sunk deep in her head like those of a death's-head, for fully a quarter of an hour in an unchanged position, staring fixedly at Bavent with rage. Once she lay senseless for half an hour in the refectory, and when the bishop commanded her spirit to depart from her, it threw her into strange contortions. Suddenly she shot away like a flash of lightning into a fairly strong fire; her face and one hand were thrust into the glowing coals, and when people ran to pull her out, no burn damage was found on her; only some blackness and a little ash lay on the part of the face that the heat had touched, which could easily be blown away. She was thrown violently backward onto her head in the cloister courtyard, without it harming her; she climbed up a ten-foot-high wall on an old piece of wood, and ran along it to a spot where no ladder could be placed. The nuns begged her to go back to where she could be brought down. One of the exorcists adjured her spirit and began to pray on his knees. Dagon cried out: If you do not stop, I will hurl the carcass down! And indeed, he threw her the ten feet down onto stones and bricks, without her being injured in the slightest. Sister Anna of St. Augustine was to go to confession, but her spirit Gonzag would not allow it for two hours. Her confessor Bosroger, weary of his obstinacy, finally commanded him in the Latin tongue to enclose himself in the left foot of the possessed one and to set her spirit free for the task. He resisted most violently for an hour, but finally had to obey; and he gave the sign of obedience imposed upon him by striking the floor in rhythm with that foot. The nun now confessed without disturbance and then also went to the Lord's table; but as she did not know what had actually occurred, she limped on the left foot and finally fell to that side, so that she had to be led. Later Gonzag would not come out of his hiding place and had to be forced once more to free the foot.

The same Marie of the Holy Spirit was likewise to go to communion at the time of examination; for four hours her Dagon resisted, driving her through the crowd into all corners of the church; and finally he jumped with her onto the high altar, where he blasphemed God and demanded adoration from those present. The exorcists now called out to him: *Illa superbia quae te de coelo praecipitavit, deturbet te de altari.* Immediately, as if struck by a thunderbolt, he fell to the ground against the railing, four or five steps from the altar. They also banished him into a foot, which stiffness immediately seized, so that she might complete the communion in peace.

All the obsessed ones in general were, after their attacks---in which the head was bent backward against the heels---brought into the bow form. Sister of St. Lawrence, allegedly possessed by Behemoth, was during one hour bent two or three times into this form; similarly the one of the Redeemer, so perfectly that the head lay down to the mouth at the feet, while the belly formed a complete arch. Once she was as if broken in two, the head and face hanging backward to below the middle of the feet near the heels; like a handkerchief laid over the finger, so that the ends hung down on both sides. Sister Louise of the Ascension, terribly plagued for a whole year with every sort of nervous ailment, was several times placed in such a position that she touched the earth only with a flank of the left side or of the belly, in a breadth of about four inches. \[Page 226\]

The entire rest of the body was in the air, the two arms extended with all force, and bent backwards and from below upwards; the head thrown entirely back over the shoulders, almost to the region of the loins, as one is accustomed to depict the Sirens; the legs and feet likewise thrown backwards, drawn close to the head to the breadth of four fingers, without any part of the thus intertwined body touching the earth in the slightest. She remained so for a quarter of an hour with narrowed, exceedingly small eyes, until the bishop commanded the demon to cease. In this way the spirit sought to prevent Maria of St. Nicholas from making her confession at the grille. He therefore bent her head backwards into the choir, as she sat before the grille, down almost to the floor, two feet lower than the bench; so that, since Father Esprit, for the sake of propriety, grasped her only by the hem of her garment, she held herself on the bench only with half of her feet; in which position a sister who had hurried up straightened her by the head.

The confessor commanded the spirit to make her kneel before him. He then cried out that no one should hold her; and with a single swing, without her aiding herself with any limb in the process, she threw herself backwards to the feet of the confessor, to whom she now made her confession in all tranquility. Often her demons, after the exorcism, sought to drown her in the wells; and they came down now, leaning with the shoulders or the head against one wall, with the tip of one foot against the opposite one, and thus sliding down lengthwise, as Sister Marie of the Holy Spirit had likewise done. Or her entire body hung in the air, and she held herself to the masonry with her fingers or toes. Or finally, as it happened with the Sister of the Holy Sacrament, she slid down in a horizontal position, without being held anywhere, and was thus pulled out. Another time the Sister of the Redeemer knelt before the Archbishop of Toulouse, and told him in all composure of mind what was passing within her. Then her spirit Asmodeus suddenly flew into a rage, and bent her backwards; so that the head stood two fingers' breadth from the floor, without touching it in any way. She supported herself thereby solely on the heel of the right foot; the left foot was raised high into the air, the hands stiffly outstretched. In this way the body remained for a time standing outside its center of gravity, while the mouth meanwhile vomited forth blasphemies against God. \[Page 227\]

The mobility of the spirits in the obsession, or if one prefers, the interchange among the obsessed, is easily recognized in the following occurrences, which testify to a migration of the evil. Putiphar, who directed the Sister of the Holy Sacrament, said in the inner choir to Eneitif, who had his dwelling in Sister Barbel of St. Michael: Shall I not come into the lair that you possess? The one asked replied: Yes, I will. In an instant, Putiphar had entered the other; the Sister of the Holy Sacrament was meanwhile entirely free of her demon, threw herself immediately before the altar, and quietly prayed her breviary up to the Lauds. Sister Barbel, who meanwhile had both demons, was near the door as if nailed to the earth; the arms stretched out like two iron bars, likewise the right foot, on which no heel was any longer visible; the head of unspeakable weight, so that it could not be raised from the earth with any exertion, not even so high that the tips of the fingers could have been placed between them; and thus she remained lying for half an hour. Meanwhile the other had made her confession to the bishop, but when she too went to communion, and the holy Host had just been placed on her tongue, Putiphar came back like a flash of lightning, and cried: To the devil, I will not endure that! While I am absent, they deceive me, and let the bitch receive communion. \[Page 228\]

In the moment when he thus cried out, the other one began to twitch; and she started to howl and scream, as her demon was accustomed to do. Since the doctor, for whom they had sent, arrived too late, the bishop believed he must compel Puttiphar, through the power of the Church, to make restitution. He refused; but after they had shouted at him: "Si sit voluntas Dei, fiat!" he finally obeyed on the fourth call, and the one became free again, while the other was doubly possessed. This lasted a quarter of an hour, until they brought the holy Sacrament to the stomach of the latter, who lay stiff and heavy upon the ground. When they had progressed from the words "O salutaris hostia!" to the others "Da robur, fer auxilium!", she began to stir and move. In the same instant, the sister of the holy Sacrament collapsed in convulsions at the other end of the choir; as swiftly as a shot wild animal in the flash of the gun. The same transfer repeated itself several times in the presence of many people, among whom were also doctors, who wrote down their report on it, and noted therein how the actions and sufferings had been separated by sufficient intervals from the general tetanus. Often the demon, in such a transfusion---after the stiffness and heaviness---produced a great pliancy and incomparable lightness; as we indeed found several times the head of one such person, who had two demons, as light as a ball of wool, but the neck as flexible as a piece of old linen cloth, and as if it had no sinews. The demon himself attributed the heaviness of the head to the strife between the two for the upper position in the head.

After these events, which occurred among crowds of nuns, it will not be surprising if we see similar symptoms break out in whole masses of the people. When, in July 1214, the Church of the Apostles in Liège was consecrated, whole crowds of a wondrous sect came from Upper Germany, from the Rhine and the Meuse, first to Aachen, then to Utrecht, and finally to Liège, whose manner was as follows. Men and women, possessed by the demon, half-naked, with wreaths on their heads, went along; and, holding each other by the hands, they performed dances before the spectators on the streets, in the churches, and in the houses, without the least shame. They jumped high in the air during this, and in the songs that they sang, they named demons such as Friskus and the like, which had never been heard before. When the dances were finished, they were plagued by the most violent chest cramps; so that, if their friends did not gird them around the navel region with linen cloths and draw the girdle tight, they would rage that they must die. \[Page 229\]

These hordes swelled from September to October to many thousands; for more and more dancers kept coming from Germany, and in Liège and the neighboring provinces many healthy people, and such as were completely in their right minds, were suddenly seized by the demon; and, extending their hands to the dancers, they immediately joined their choruses. Sensible people saw the cause of this phenomenon in the ignorance that prevailed in those times concerning the faith and the commandments of God. The people, however, sought the cause in the priests who kept concubines, who had not baptized the people properly; and they prepared themselves, especially in Liège, to rise up against the clergy, to strangle the culprits, and to plunder their goods. But God wished to demonstrate to men that baptism, whether administered by good or bad hands, was all the same to Him; therefore He gave to the secular priests of Liège the gift of healing such possessed persons through the laying on of hands and exorcism, which He refused to other priests.

In the Kreuzkirche there, a man who had been assigned to carry the censer around the choir during the divine service suddenly began to swing it about in a playful manner, to dance around with it, and to sing numerous songs in unknown words; and since he did not cease from all this despite reminders, people came to believe that he belonged to that sect. A priest called upon him to recite the Lord's Prayer and then the Creed; he refused to do both, and said: he believed in the devil. The priest therefore placed the stole around his neck, spoke the usual exorcisms over him, and immediately freed him; so that he recited the Creed and Pater Noster with great devotion. Around All Saints' Day, the dancers in Heristall, scarcely half a mile from Liège, had gathered in large numbers, and had resolved among themselves to go to Liège and murder the entire clergy there. But their resolution came to nothing; for when they arrived in the city, they were led by pious people to the priests, who did not harm them, but from whom they received healing. Some were brought to the Marian chapel in the St. Lambert's Church, where the priest L. Lones freed the first one, and then nine others, with the stole and the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word." The rumor soon spread, and now they came in droves, and were freed in the same manner. Others were led to other churches, where the same was accomplished with them by good and bad priests alike, without distinction.

They made use of that same Gospel for this, and subsidiarily of others as well; especially where Christ healed the demonic, such as "to the eleven as they reclined" and "Jesus sent" and the like. In cases where the freeing was more difficult, the priests either placed the Sacrament of the Eucharist on the head, or gave the blessing with it before them. To some, consecrated or exorcised water was given to drink, or, if they refused, poured into them; also the consecrated fingers were placed in the mouth under the words: "Depart, unclean spirit!" and so forth. Words were spoken into their ears, and breath blown into their faces, to break the power of the enemy. \[Page 230\]

In the St. Bartholomew's Church, a demon said to the priest: he should just stop, he would depart of his own accord. One had already gone out because of the torment, and they would never again enter a Christian person. If the exorcisms had not been performed, they would have gone from the poor into the rich and powerful, in order to drive out the clerics. A girl, treated fruitlessly by several priests, had gone to Aachen; and the cleric named Symon had dressed her there in alb and stole, and immersed her in a vessel of exorcised water up to her mouth. On the question of how long he had been in the girl? The answer was: Two years! Where he had been when she went to Easter Communion? In the toe joints. When conjured, he wanted to enter the nearby castle of Schremborg and guard it against thieves. Asked if he could blow the horn? He began to blow it with great noise before all those present. Since they also would not let him enter the Bath of Charlemagne, he finally departed, after the girl had expelled a coal from herself. When it did not succeed for a priest to free a possessed person, he added prayers and fasting to the exorcisms, and he immediately became master of it. Thus the rush to Liège was great over the course of a year; but it gradually diminished, and around three thousand were healed, lightly or severely, and they said: during the entire course of the affliction, it had seemed to them that they were immersed in a stream of blood, and that was why they had jumped so high. Even after three or four years, individuals came sporadically, and were easily freed by the clerics.

So the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the people and to the glory of the Liège clergy; since the evil, which particular dispensations had imposed, was also removed again through the intervention of higher powers. As a byproduct, the teaching of the Church was thereby strikingly confirmed, that grace is not defiled by the impure vessel, and thus that all tangible reformation is foolishness. The occasion from the natural side was probably a kind of St. Vitus' dance, which had taken its seat in the abdominal ganglia, and now discharging itself against the pulmonary ganglia, excited those dances; but in the reaction, the spasmodic affliction toward the diaphragm, which could only be alleviated by the constriction of the epigastric region. The depolarization had proceeded downward, from where a sloping inclination toward the demonic sets in; the people had therefore directed their solicited intention thither, and it had taken on the character of obsession for the evil; and the dances, to the foreign-sounding Sabbath songs with the demon names, became a pavane. But this turn had now also made it possible to attack the evil from the ecclesiastical side, and it had succeeded happily thereby. In our times, less fuss would have been made; the police would have dispersed the dancers as lunatics, and in any case beaten those who resisted; the compliant ones would have been shunted back to their homes, and there might have made their peace with their friskiness or withered away. Enlightenment would have triumphed over darkness, and the applause of all friends of the victor would have fallen to the expedition.

#### B. The Psychic Contagion in the Obsession

\[Page 231\]

The ease of transmission in this and the preceding case brings us close to the fact that there must be a contagion, which, as it were, atmospherically envelops the inner core, carrying the effect from one to another. Whoever enters into the demonic circles experiences there a transmutation of his entire being, through all organic regions; thus in the fluid as in the solid, in the nervous as in that which envelops the nerves; hence also in the aura, which surrounds the human being and every single organ in him from afar. But the demonization now communicates itself, just as electrification, magnetization, heating, and the like do on physical bodies; and the demonized corporeality becomes a ferment, a yeast and mother of vinegar, which is capable of producing again in others, even in still healthy personalities, and thus all the more easily in those already inclined toward the pathological, the same process from which it itself has emerged in this manner. The most suitable medium in which this communication occurs at a distance will therefore be precisely that aura which surrounds the entire fermenting corporeality; which participates in its conditions in its own way, and carrying it over into the foreign, thereby awakens the like in the encompassed personalities. This aura, like that around the sun which mediates the reciprocal intercourse to its world bodies, will have different regions, propagating itself to farther or nearer distances through the higher or deeper; but the processes on this side and that, above and below the mediating, will always relate to each other as archetype and copy. \[Page 232\]

If, therefore, in the midst of a fellowship anyone has been found who has attained virtuosity in these domains; if the demonic has not merely, as in ordinary life, operated through distribution and in a mere aggregate state; but if it has struck and ignited within him, so that he has now become an independent source of the wild fire: then such a one, acting as deputy for evil, kindling it himself, can bring the conflagration into the surrounding bonds; and all those who, even if spatially distant from him, yet stand inwardly connected to him in sympathy, will be seized by him; unintentionally, where the transmission still belongs to the previous category, but also intentionally and with premeditation, where the practice then falls to its own \[category\]. If these are indeed spiritually, morally, and physically healthy natures, at the height of their vital force, then he will indeed accomplish little. But if it is an age less guarded against external impressions, a youthful stage that comes in his path; or a disposition disarmed by illness, or otherwise already inclined by temperament that draws near to him; if above all a spiritual, especially a moral, means of appropriation is already present: then he strikes swiftly, draws such personalities, appropriating them to himself, into his circle; and armed with them, he lords and rules in this sphere of action at his pleasure.

As for the children, in the Basque country some two thousand of them had been found, who, according to their statements, had been to the Sabbath. They had all confessed: if a sorceress wanted to lead them there, she would merely pass her hand over their face or head; immediately thereafter they would find themselves wholly confused, and as if out of themselves; but they did not say that the hands had been anointed. Sometimes, they protested, the women would give them an apple to eat, or a piece of black millet bread; after they had eaten it, they would become entirely defenseless, and then it would not fail---they would come the following night to fetch them. Even if they were then held fast in the arms of their elders and siblings, no one could awaken them. Such was the unanimous testimony of 2--300 children who were examined on the matter.

Johanna du Hard, 56 years old, had testified: when she had gone out of the church with a professed sorceress named Chorrozique, the latter had touched her arm, and she had immediately become as if dead. Corneille Brolu, 12 years old, deposed: that once, in 1608 during the fast at St. Jean de Luz, the sorceress Marie Martin had passed her hand over his head; and thereafter, in the following night, in the form of a cat, had taken him from his bed, out from the midst of two other boys; and had led him to Lecohanda, that is, to the great lake, where the Sabbath was held. Since that woman had died, he had not gone there for a month; until another took charge of him and led him there again. Since then he had been disenchanted, in that the woman whom they had summoned to justify herself---because she had not white but, like all her kind, red blood---had had some drops of it drawn, and with it a belt had been smeared. In the Swedish Elfdale as well, the children were awakened from sleep and taken there, with or against their will. If they betrayed it to anyone, they were harshly beaten at the following Sabbath; signs of this, however, were seldom to be discovered. Upon their return, the children usually looked quite weak, pale, and battered, and could scarcely recover the next day. They therefore often sought to save themselves before being led away, and when it began to come upon them, they would lie in the arms of their elders. These would sit by them and watch over them whole nights through; and as soon as they noticed an unusual pallor in them, they would shake them violently, but it helped nothing.

They also noticed that their breast became entirely cold; they also stuck a burning light into their hair, but it did not ignite. Their state of being away from themselves lasted sometimes half an hour, a full hour, or even two hours; and when the children came back to themselves, they lamented and wept most piteously, and begged forgiveness to the utmost of their ability, as much as they could. This was solemnly declared on oath before the court by two old men, who wished to call all the residents of the village as witnesses; for their children had mostly all experienced the same thing. Those grips of the witches were magnetic grips, which transferred the state of the one grasping into the one grasped. The state was, from the natural side, a magnetism; an inner awakening of the ganglia of the lower body, connected with the closure of the senses, the concentration of life in that region, and thus a cooling of the lung system; as it all showed itself in those Nordic children. But since the magnetism was at the same time of a demonic nature, the Sabbath had necessarily to be evoked in the circle of visions. \[Page 233\]

Such a communication of the evil also manifests itself in manifold other ways. The father of a Swiss woman in Bayonne wanted to buy apples in 1605 from two notorious women, Galanta and Mandiburo. While haggling, his daughter bit into one of the apples that was offered to her; and she was immediately seized by a nervous disorder that returned at once every time she caught sight of the two women. It consisted in such a violent movement of one arm that the whole body was shaken by it and thrown to the ground; whereby her fingers moved with such rapidity that no virtuoso on any instrument could have matched her in agility. This repeated itself every time she sighted the woman, and with such violence that when de Lancre, who at first took it for simulation, together with two others tried to hold the arm fast and prevent its movement, they found it impossible; and instead, all three were most violently shaken by it. No other means remained to calm the half-dead one again than to remove the women; whereupon she, as was shown by the threefold repetition of the experiment, immediately came back to herself. \[Page 234\]

Since then, when the same de Lancre was instructing at the Parliament of Bordeaux the trial of a sorcerer and of four witches from Amou near Eaux, these confessed how they transmitted two kinds of such diseases: once the falling sickness in full fury, more violent than the natural kind; and then the evil called Layra. This evil showed itself from time to time in the church of that place; where, as often as a witch entered who had given it to one or more in the assembly, sometimes forty or more persons began to bark like dogs in the full-moon nights. But sometimes the barking also occurred at a distance from the witch-women, because these could evoke it at their pleasure even from afar; then the afflicted did not cease calling them by name. One had already become so accustomed to it that if someone in their house felt an attack of the evil, their household immediately ran out into the street; and if they then found the called one there, this served them as testimony that often confirmed the confession. The court in Bordeaux, which had found these circumstances in the instruction of the judge from Amou, wanted to assure itself of the matter; and therefore dispatched two commissioners, Moneins and de Lancre, to take the thus bewitched into closer examination. The wife of a captain, who had suffered from the Layra for two years, was brought into the hall of the Tour de la Lanterne to the commission. She walked calmly about in it, viewing some pictures hanging there.

As soon as the gentlemen, against whom she had testified, without her being able to know it, were brought near her, she began at the very moment when they entered the staircase to bark most violently; so that it resounded through the entire house. The women were made to go back down the stairs, and the sick woman was spoken to reassuringly; she replied that she had no fear; and indeed, large as she was, she had a brave, manly appearance; but she could not overcome the abhorrence of coming into the nearness of these women. The malady had been done to her, as she believed, during a childbirth, since which she had remained barren; and while telling this, she stood there, arms akimbo, and stroking toward the womb for about a quarter of an hour, after which she became calm again. The commission repeated the experiment two more times with the same result; as the women, named Four and Fezendin, came near, the malady manifested itself both times so violently that the gentlemen came running together from all the rooms, and all became witnesses themselves of the trial. The screaming was so piercing that she had to be completely removed from the building. 1) It was also sometimes found that the sorceresses had passed the malady on to one another, in order to remain beyond suspicion. Thus the Violone of St. Jehan was accused by the Françoise Broqueiro of having been at the Sabbath in a conspiracy, where the same evil was inflicted upon her. \[Page 235\]

But she replied: she was innocent, and had suffered the evil like herself. And in fact, she had such a severe attack on the witness stand that she had to be carried away. The same woman always named nine different people who had collaborated in it, among them Jean de la Lanne; and every time she was brought to the torture after him, she had a new attack. The same Broqueiron also confessed: how she had given a powder to the liver of a woman, which however only stayed with her for two days. That the transfer could also be done to animals, even to plants themselves, she affirmed; on the one hand, she stated how she had made birds fall down like epileptics; on the other hand, she recounted: all the witches of the diocese of Amiens, who were known, were obliged every year on the same day, at the same hour, to wither an elder tree (Ulmus); by circling it three times, and laying some salt on its most vigorously growing branch.

The latter can be left to rest until closer examination; but what was told before is remarkable, because it strikingly shows: that one who, in a tense mood, has drawn a far-reaching aura around herself, can evoke an analogous mood in a circle of such predisposed persons. A case in which all circumstances, well considered, and the confessions of those involved taken into aid, hardly offers any other explanation than through conscious transfer, is the story of Renata Sänger, who at the end of the first half of the previous century ascended the stake. She was, according to the intelligently written report that the Premonstratensian Oswald Loschert, abbot of the monastery of Oberzell, as an eyewitness wrote down immediately after her death, and sent to Empress Maria Theresa, born around 1680 in Munich, and without the knowledge of her parents already in early youth in contact with suspicious people, and thus initiated into various traditional magical arts circulating among them.

Taught by an old woman, she had already begun these studies in her seventh year; a rider had then continued the begun work in her ninth; and in the eleventh and thirteenth, two officers, a maid, and a noble lady had successively joined. From them she had received various magical herbs, especially a root of great power, and a little black man, which however soon disappeared again, probably a mandrake; various talismans with numbers and letters and incantations of all kinds, and learned many arts: to make people sick at will by her blowing upon them, by fixed gazing, accompanied by reciting certain formulas, by needle pricks into specifically shaped figures, by placing the herbs under the door threshold, or by communicating falsified foods, to drive them out of their senses, or to plunge them into demonic relations. Here one sees the aftereffect of the Thirty Years' War, whose terrible dissolution, barbarization, and despair had recently brought forth all these traditions of malice from earlier centuries, further developed them, and spread them among all classes, especially the lower ones and the wild soldiery. In the practice of these arts she soon became visionary; she heard, gazing into the distance, what was secretly spoken of her here and there; she saw herself at the Sabbath, with the change of her name to Emma Renata, entered into the black book, and received seventy years of life promised in exchange for her renunciation. All this was now a poor preparatory school for the monastic life that she, compelled by her parents who were unable to do otherwise, around 1699 entered in the monastery of Unterzell, which was highly esteemed for its discipline and strictness. \[Page 236\]

Had she been endowed with a less resolute character, and possessed less mastery over herself than was truly the case; then this disproportion would have had to lead to a swifter outbreak. But resolute as she was, once she had taken her side, she went her ways in silence, without letting anything outwardly be noticed. She submitted herself to all the rigor of discipline; was careful in the fulfillment of her order's duties, and even knew how to spread around herself an appearance of piety; so that many held her in high esteem, and her convent sisters appointed her subprioress; indeed, they would have elected her prioress, if not a frequent dissatisfaction with her state, often rushing into it, a persistent aversion against her superiors, and a continuing restlessness on account of inner concerns, which she only hinted at with half words and would confide to no one, had held her back from it. This uncanny quality in her being, combined with the dark seclusion in which she set herself apart from all, also brought it about that for many years she came into no closer intercourse or more intimate association with any of her fellow sisters; which in turn preserved these from contagion by her arts, which she ceaselessly practiced for herself, drawing the herbs in the convent garden, and procuring from outside whatever else she lacked. Meanwhile it could not fail to happen that her heart must have embittered itself in this isolation; the compulsion to outward hypocrisy, alongside the secret practice of wicked arts, must have, ever increasing the tornness of her nature, filled her with resentment and hatred. This was greatly augmented still further by outward circumstances that arose; such as when in the year 1738 the provost of the convent removed the many cats with which she surrounded herself---already characteristic of her disposition, even if they did not, as she later confessed, hang together with her sorcery---on account of the great unrest they caused. Her mind, it seems, was thereby embittered to the depths, and from then on she began to direct her arts against those who had drawn her hatred upon themselves. From this moment onward peace and quiet had fled from the community of sisters; and the convent became the scene of the strangest events. Nightly there arose tumult and unrest within and without the cells; now it seemed to the sisters as if coaches and wagons were driving through the dormitory; now they heard in the garden, beneath the windows of the same, an unusual clamor. When they lay in their beds, then they were pressed, struck, pinched, and strangled; so that in the morning they could scarcely stir, and more than once bore blue marks from it; the locking of the cell, the sprinkling with holy water, and the blessing helped for a time, but never in the long run. Once when one of the convent women, on such an occasion, struck about her with her scourge, and the tormenting spirit fled from her after she seemed to have hit it hard, there was seen early in the morning on Renata's eye a bloody mark; which indeed awakened some suspicion against her, but naturally led to no certainty. But soon others fell gravely ill, and it was noticed that it was always the best, and those most useful to the convent, who in this manner were suddenly, and as if struck by evil sorcery, afflicted with burdensome and painful illnesses. This fate befell four in succession within the convent walls; and it was soon observed that the evil also spread outside of them, in a striking manner, to the male and female relatives of the provost. In five other sisters there soon appeared symptoms of another kind. \[Page 237\]

They retired to rest, then they came---without really sleeping---out of themselves; and in this state, having become clairvoyant, they now saw various persons standing before them, among these also Renata; who tormented them in every conceivable manner and way, without their being able to stir themselves, to defend, or even to cry out. On the whole following day they were then tormented by inner anxieties, which especially multiplied in the church; from which they were often driven out against their will, as by an irresistible force. When they went to choir, their voice was alternately taken away and restored, and their singing in between transformed into a hideous howling; whereby the throat sometimes swelled high, and then fell together again. All this was connected with trembling, head-shaking, striking of hands and breast, and various convulsive movements; accompanied by the feeling as if an animal moved in their body; great despondency and despairing thoughts joined themselves likewise to these evils.

All who had been seized by this state were, according to the testimony of the doctors, previously of good bodily constitution; their mental powers were unimpaired, their conduct showed itself blameless. Thus neither in a natural cause nor in a sinful play of lies could the ground of those hitherto unheard-of effects be sought; but no one thought of possession and sorcery. Among the sick was also Cäcilia Pistorini from Amberg, and from this one the spirit had begun to speak in 1745, named his name, and predicted much of the future; but since she did not speak in foreign languages and nothing very remarkable, one still took offense at advising possession. Moreover, one was not sure of her as one who had only recently been in the convent; and that had brought her many humiliations and hard trials from the side of the superior. Renata had been very active in this; she persecuted the afflicted one, on whom she had cast a hatred, to the utmost; and since on account of her age and understanding she stood in some esteem with many, she took all pains to teach those in the convent: there are neither witches nor possessed, and what showed itself in Cäcilia was a pretended thing, mixed with many punishable disorders. In the meantime, however, no one could see what the unfortunate one drove to such a play; one had previously, when her states began to show themselves, given her leave to leave the convent; with tears in her eyes she had begged for her admission, to all trials she had willingly submitted with humility and obedience.

She herself, when her mouth in her attacks spoke terrible blasphemies, or to her shame blurted out the secrets of her heart, and the most terrible convulsions shook her; then she nevertheless never wanted to be persuaded that she was really possessed; she held herself only for one who on account of her sins had been abandoned and rejected by God. In the meantime, however, one had at last decided on the application of exorcism on her, this had not missed its effect; but the states had always returned again, and one had then each time noticed: that Renata had come close to her shortly before, breathed on her, murmured some words to her, or made some gestures; and it had then each time been to her as if a fireball passed through her body, whereupon the convulsions immediately set in again. That must of course awaken suspicion; all the more, since also one of the sick convent women, who on account of her spirit and her exceptional piety stood in great veneration in the convent, on her deathbed had repeatedly testified against Renata. \[Page 238\]

But they still took scruple at allowing themselves to be prompted by this to any measure against her; and instead ordered a general church prayer in the convent: to implore from above help in the heavy distress, and light in the dark matter. The devotion had been continued for about three days; when the mouths of two more among the five opened, whose spirits had hitherto been mute; and amid the most violent convulsions it cried forth from them: Alas, our time has come, we may no longer conceal ourselves; whereby they, as ones compelled thereto by higher power, testified against Renata as the originator of all the evils. When one immediately applied the exorcism against them, they confirmed what had earlier been said voluntarily.

A few weeks later the remaining three also began to speak, and all six now unanimously attested the same; so that, as at the same time the torments and plagues of the afflicted were raised to the highest pitch, and no one could any longer doubt a real possession, general mourning arose in the convent, from which even Renata did not outwardly withdraw herself. The spirits, however, did not cease to testify against her; they gave the year, day and hour, place and occasion with the utmost exactness, where she there four or six, there ten and eleven years before had wrought evil; so that finally the long-spun net over the unfortunate one had to draw itself together. Her superiors had, in praiseworthy calm and moderation, still taken scruple at doing her any harm; until finally the provost of the convent found it advisable to carry out that upon which Renata herself, out of hatred against Cäcilia, had pressed for a year and a day; by requesting the abbot of Oberzell to institute a formal investigation of the matter. This one came over, examined the convent sisters under oath, and found Renata so multiply implicated through their statements, that he could not refrain from separating her for the time being from the rest of the convent.

She herself, when questioned about the accusations, had steadfastly maintained her innocence; and when the abbot pronounced the separation against her, she had begged to be allowed to go once more to her cell beforehand, in order to take with her some writings containing matters of conscience and confession; which was naturally not permitted to her, and now in the investigation the ointment box, various magic herbs, a yellow robe and the like were found. When, at her imprisonment, the possessed were quickly brought near, it began to howl and lament miserably from them, and it cried forth from some: O ye accursed hounds! why will ye destroy our nest? O little love---thus they called Renata---do not forsake us! The confessor of the convent now gave himself all effort to bring the unfortunate one to a sincere confession and to a conversion of life; and it seemed to him in so far to succeed, that she not only to him outside of confession, but also to the superiors of the convent quite voluntarily laid the confession: that she was a sorceress, had learned sorcery outside the convent, and had brought the six possessed into the state in which they found themselves; and that indeed with all the circumstances as the voices from them had earlier spoken. \[Page 239\]

There was now no exercise of repentance, no renunciation and abjuration, which Renata did not repeat after the priests with all outward signs of contrition; thereby showing such composure of mind as if she had never committed any evil. When she was alone in solitude, then one saw her lying on her knees before the crucifix, or reciting the rosary; so that, to judge thereby, a complete change seemed to have taken place in her. But the nightly torments of the possessed continued as before and after, and Renata was always visible to them therein as a helper; although meanwhile a lay sister did not let her out of her sight in her room.

The voices only mocked with their pretended conversion, and in doing so revealed blasphemies that they had committed during their confinement without the presence of a single human being; so that one again began to doubt the sincerity of their improvement; doubts which were later justified by her own confession.

Up to this point, the whole matter had been kept secret and confined within the cloister walls, and in accordance with the manner of ecclesiastical procedure in such cases, in the hope that a way might be found to settle the affair quietly, every public step and summoning of witnesses had been avoided. But the cries and howls of the demons from the possessed became so noisy that they resounded throughout the entire region around the cloister; from one of them they had betrayed to the visiting elders the condition of their daughter, and accused Renata as the originator; so that soon the rumor of what was happening spread all around. They now first resorted to a new confessor; Father Maurus from the Scottish monastery in Würzburg was summoned, in the hope that he might perhaps succeed in moving her heart. Her confessions, tears, and contrition at first made him believe that he had succeeded; but new events in the cloister, and the continuing accusations of the possessed, soon led him to doubt his opinion again.

The confrontation with her accusers brought her to new confessions of ongoing misdeeds, and to repeated vows of improvement; on which occasion she, among other things, declared: how she would no longer be able to do harm if she were taken to another place. One doubted the truth of this statement; for in the meantime the nightly unrest would not subside, and indeed several voices were heard speaking with Renata at night on more than one occasion, and then, at a horn call, she rose up from them like a light cloud; moreover, since the voices of the possessed threatened her with death, and once even suddenly hacked in the outermost door of the place of her confinement with an axe that happened to be seized, it was believed necessary to agree to her removal from the cloister. The matter was therefore reported to the Prince-Bishop, and a request was made for the dispatch of a commission, so that this commission might examine Renata, and, according to the findings, order her safekeeping in Marienberg Castle. \[Page 240\]

It happened as the petitioners wished; the bishop at that time, with some companions of both ecclesiastical and secular estates, among whom there were also some physicians, appeared in the cloister, and above all had the possessed nuns brought forward. One addressed him with these words: Cur venis in brevibus, ei non in longis vestibus? Another jumped out the window before the eyes of the assembly, laughed and made noise, holding onto the window frame, and was soon back in the room just as quickly. Yet another seized the bishop by the arm, pulled him out of the room with her to the cell in which Renata was locked up; hastily she took off her slipper from her foot, struck the padlock, and it opened. The commission then withdrew again, and the scenes in the cloister continued their course once more. All the sisters prayed for Renata, the possessed offered up their torments for her; and one after the other, after a terrible attack had preceded in each, delivered, driven by her spirit, an address to her, praising God's long-suffering, but also threatening her with His wrath; so that tears came to the eyes of all those present. She alone stood obstinate; she did indeed confess the misdeeds that the spirits charged her with, but at the same time asserted: her time was not yet up; and when once all the possessed unanimously pressed in upon her to compel her to renounce the pact and hand over the magic root, she did deliver some herbs and men's hairs that she had managed to keep even in her dungeon; but at the same time, suspicious events were reported again.

Finally, the spirits had granted her, as the last period of grace, three more days; when these had passed, Renata suddenly collapsed in the presence of the possessed, as if struck by lightning, at the feet of the confessor---so that he thought her dead, and the spirits howled triumphantly. She came to herself again, however, and was now, while the possessed were handed over to medical care in Würzburg, brought in secular clothes to Castle Marienberg, and her trial immediately instituted. During the same, she continuously gave all signs of true repentance; but the torments in the monastery and among the possessed would not cease on that account. \[Page 241\]

They disregarded it and did not stop. She was still seen at night, as she with others inflicted these torments; the hands and faces of the maltreated showed traces in the morning, and various objects were found in the beds, which had been dragged from other places in the monastery for this purpose. The possessed were alternately freed through the exorcisms and newly afflicted again; and the spirits continuously testified from them against Renata. She was therefore interrogated repeatedly, and since she persisted in her previous confessions and continuously admitted herself guilty of sorcery, she was finally declared forfeit of all spiritual privileges and immediately handed over to the secular courts: which, after a newly conducted investigation, condemned her according to the laws on sorcery to the fire; which the highest authority mitigated to the effect that she should first be executed with the sword. The judgment was executed on the sixth of February 1629; both at the announcement and at the execution, Renata remained calm and composed, and the external signs of repentance continued as before; but the spirits of the possessed interpreted this calm differently, and predicted certain circumstances of the execution.

That is the course of this wondrous story, as the most credible witnesses have communicated it. Many writings of the time have sharply criticized the severity of the judgment; but one could not help granting full justice to the calm, impartiality, and humanity with which the investigation was conducted from all sides. Every attempt at an interpretation that would exclude all demonic influences involves completely insoluble difficulties. The most immediate thing that offers itself to such an interpretation---the assumption of an unintentional self-deception among all involved---will least lead to the goal. Were all the possessed, the sick, Renata, the superiors, and the judges---the former insane, the latter accomplices---then scarcely any mark would remain by which one could then securely recognize the state of unaltered health. Renata and the possessed were obviously in opposite states; they are in self-contradicting tensions; and yet the one, when pressed into a corner, always confirms the statement of the others; they mutually respond to each other and complement each other in a certain alternating manner. Thus there is a kind of established harmony between their spheres, and it by no means suffices to assume a simple madness or a general delusion; but a world of madness must be assumed, which in the midst of denying its being yet affirms itself in its members; and in the most thorough dissonance yet, as it were against its will, remains subject to the law of harmony. The assumption of a fraud that crept in must drive into even greater confusions. Judges and superiors are beyond such an assumption, and among the other participants, suspicion and doubt do not know where to settle.

The only possibility might point to that Cäcilia who had stood as a special object of Renata's hatred; but precisely in this case the spirit does not testify against Renata as the immediate author of the evil that she had to endure; and the testimony that her superiors give regarding her disposition and conduct is incompatible with such a presupposition. But, even if allowed, it further demands, in order to become serviceable for explanation, the assumption of a continued understanding over many years with the other possessed, the sick and even the remaining convent sisters. All that raging, all those convulsions were either fabricated, and the physicians and other witnesses blind; or they were truly grounded in reality. \[Page 242\]

Should they now all have been directed against the one unfortunate with intent; this demands the presupposition of an understanding between the ringleader and her tools, and of a deliberate plan, kept secret for so long a time among so many people, logically carried out again and again toward the ruin of a human being; an infamy that one can attribute only to very rare cases in human nature, and which moreover must have stood in alliance with her own victim; since without such a thing her cooperation would be entirely incomprehensible. It could thus at most be an unconscious rapport, such as exists between the one from whom the contagion has proceeded, and those infected by it; in which case that Cäcilia would stand as the unconscious intermediary person; as it were the living miasma whose the others made use, in order to spread the infection generally around them. One sees how complicated this case had been, and how, despite all moderation and caution that prevailed among the judges, it would nevertheless have been more advisable to pronounce, instead of the death penalty, imprisonment until the cessation of the evil and the conversion. The continuance of the evil in the convent, during her imprisonment at Marienberg, could not prove the necessity of removing the author from the way; for it continued also for a considerable time after her death, and was dispelled only by continued exorcism.

#### C. Transitions of the Obsession into the Possession through Demonic

Epidemics

The obsession requires the intervention of a personality that knots the rapports, and in the negating unity rounds the banishing magic circle of the obsessed. The possession requires no such mediation; the negating unity strikes immediately into a personality, makes it its shell, and the one thus sporadically seized does not, as a rule, spread further infection around herself. But this striking can also happen simultaneously into many individuals, and these, placed near to one another by their calling and other circumstances of life, then enter into rapports with one another, and with the invisible center, which altogether has an epidemic character. One easily comprehends that such states have great affinity with those of epidemic obsessions, and form the transitions between the being afflicted and the being attacked. First, such cases will present themselves where, although the suspicion may well have pointed to a personal center, nothing certain has been ascertained about it. Thus Massäus says: In the year 1491, around the feast of Peter's Chair, the demons began to inhabit and possess the convent of the nuns of Quercy (Quercetensium), and to torment its inhabitants most cruelly for four years and four months. One saw them frequently running through the fields like dogs, flying in the air like birds, climbing trees in the manner of cats, hanging from the branches, imitating the voices of various animals, penetrating secrets, and prophesying future things. \[Page 243\]

So often Heinrich, Bishop of Cambrai, or Aegidius Nettetet, Dean of his church, both pious men, set out for exorcism, they knew it beforehand, and cried: The one with the horns is again on the way to threaten us. After all manner of means had been applied, which were sought out from everywhere, their names were brought to Rome and read out by Alexander VI on Maundy Thursday under the Mass; but without any effect. Johanna Potier, who was held to be the beginning of the evil, had been in confidential relations with the demon from her ninth year onward, and this one accused her in the convent: that she had gone to Communion 434 times unworthily; which statement, however, since he is a liar from the beginning, cannot be trusted. She was led to Cambrai and died in the dungeon on St. Martin's Day; the others were freed in June after four years of possession. Joh. Molinet in his Belgian chronicle for the year 1490 confirms these accounts, adding: that the evil had passed from one to the other innocents. The demons had given themselves out as angels of light who belonged to the hierarchy of the Seraphim, and had at last been driven out by the Dean of Cambrai. He had carried the Eucharist to the sick, and set the demons the condition: if it were nothing but bread, then it might by no means disturb them in their possession; but if the body of the Lord, then they must withdraw from the possessed.

Wier, whose testimony as a physician and Protestant one may here allow to stand,¹ even if he had the weakness of believing in the devil, has recorded several other cases of this kind from his own experience. In the convent of Kentorp, in the county of Mark not far from Hamm, the enclosed nuns, noblewomen as well as others, were seized by a possession; and the individuals in various ways, some more violently, others more mildly, tormented. In this variety, however, there was one thing common to all: that as soon as one was seized by an attack, all the others, even if they were in completely separate rooms, as soon as they heard the noise, were likewise drawn into it and miserably plagued. Anna Lemgon was one of the older and stout-hearted sisters who clearly explained to the physician Wier the circumstances of the whole evil. It began with her, who was one of the first seized, with pains in the left hypochondrium; she was held to be seized by epilepsy, and was sent to the convent of Nonnery so that she might drink from the skull of the holy Cornelius; she did so, and the nuns now falsely said that she was better. \[Page 244\]

But when she was soon more violently visited by the evil, and other nuns were likewise found drawn into it; a soothsayer was consulted, who gave testimony against the convent's cook as the originator of the evil. Now the malignancy of the plague increased; the convulsions became more manifold and more deeply cutting, and the seized were driven to bite one another, and so also other strangers, to strike and throw down; yet without further harm, since they seemed to themselves as light as feathers, and now noticed that they were not masters of themselves. If they were held back from striking or the other acts of violence, they were pressed in the heart; but if they were let loose again, they felt, even if they injured or bit themselves, no evil at all; so that it seemed as if it had become a necessity for them to rage against their own bodies. If Anna gave herself to prayer, she could by no means follow it with attention or move her tongue for it; but if she merely chattered off her hours thoughtlessly, then she was in no way hindered from it; it rather seemed to her as if she were thereby relieved and refreshed.

She could not think seriously about any good or evil matter; it seemed to her then as if she were stupid in spirit, without sense, without distinction, and without judgment. If a religious, God-consecrated man addressed her, she was as it were scolded by the devil on that account; but if she spoke with this one, or with another female person, about vain and trivial things, then she was wonderfully uplifted and exalted thereby. Although all were plagued in manifold ways, they were nevertheless all of good appetite, and the nourishment proceeded well. From here the malady now soon spread also to the nearby city of Hamm, afflicting not a few citizens of this city with various torments. When they were instructed by the pastor of the place in his room, and he had them recite the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer; they began to question one another, and the demons now named themselves with jesting names, as one said: he was called Flederwisch, another Flatfoot, the third Rosenbaum; but he who now wrought mischief in the monastery at Kentorp named himself Hornuar.

At last one asked: The pastor wants to drive us out; what shall we do now? The other replied: I will ride on a black buck to that woman whom he named; I shall be a dear guest to her. The other said: he would go with the same conveyance to a second one. Both, sitting backward on chairs like fools, now seemed, as gesture and voice indicated, to ride to the aforementioned places; without, however, having moved from the spot. A third, rolled and drawn together like a ball, rushed toward the closed door; and as this was suddenly opened, he fell down the stairs, but entirely unharmed. In the place Houel near Hamm, likewise many possessed persons came to light. Also in another neighboring city the inhabitants were seized by similar attacks and plagues, on account of which many investigations arose there against individuals. As in this case the manifestation of possession often hovers midway between malice and jest; so the contagion that produced it hovers between a moral and a physical one. \[Page 245\]

The cook Elsa of Camen was named to the nuns by the soothsayer as the originator of their ills; and she, or her mother and her brother, or the image of a black cat, appeared to them henceforth always during the attacks. She herself suffered from an epileptic malady, like the others; but now it was said that she had inflicted it upon herself, to divert suspicion from herself. When imprisoned, she at first confessed to poison; but dying, she denied having used anything other than curses. Wondrous was the plague of a number of nuns in the monastery of Werte in the county of Horn. The beginning of it was traced there to a poor woman who, during Lent, had borrowed a quart, about three pounds of salt, from the monastery, and had returned the loan nearly double by Easter. Now white pellets were found in the dormitory, resembling sugar-coated seeds in appearance, but of salty taste; these, however, were not eaten, and no one knew how they had come there. Then something was heard sighing about there, like a sick person; voices were also sometimes heard inviting several of the virgins to rise and go with it to the fire, for it was sick. If they really got up to look after the sick sister, they found no one. If one of them wanted to relieve herself into the chamber pot, it was violently snatched from her, and the bed besmirched with what had been passed. Sometimes they were dragged out of bed a few steps, and tickled under the soles of their feet in such a way that they feared they must die from excessive laughter.

Several pieces of flesh were torn out from some; but from many others, their legs, arms, and faces were twisted backward. Some of those thus tormented, although they had taken nothing for 59 days but turnip broth with bread, nevertheless vomited up a black substance like ink in great quantities; it was so sharp and bitter that it ate away the hands in their mouths. Some were lifted up above the heads of the people and thrown down again. Once, when the sick were calmed and therefore very cheerful, about thirteen friends visited the convent at the same time; the nuns were thrown senseless and speechless from the table, so that several lay there with twisted arms and legs as if dead. One was lifted up, and although those present laid hands to resist, she was nevertheless torn out above their heads and then dashed down again in such a way that she lay there as if dead. Afterward she came to herself as if from a deep sleep and walked about unharmed. Some walked supported on the ends of their leg bones, without making use of their feet, which they dragged after them as if entirely loosened from their ligaments. \[Page 246\]

They climbed the trees like cats and crept down them again without making any movement of the body. The worthy mother of the convent, while she was engaged in conversation with the noble and pious Margaretha, Countess of Bur, had a piece of flesh torn from her loins. She cried out in pain and was carried to bed; but the wound suppurated in part, and in part it was black; however, she was healed. Once, when two of the afflicted nuns were sitting together laughing and cheerful, and speaking with one another of a black cat that a matron of the town, whom they named, had sent locked in a basket into the dormitory; a third healthy one had secretly listened to their talk, and the prioress had examined the basket with her and two or three others, whereupon the cat then jumped away. For this reason the woman was accused of maleficium, and thrown into the dungeon with seven others. Although neighbors and the poor gave her testimony of such mercy toward the needy that she herself went hungry; she was put to the torture but could not be brought to confession by any torment. When the bailiff thereupon offered her food according to custom, she declared: she was too weak to eat, but begged for something to drink. When the drink was immediately handed to her by the bailiff, she seized his garment and, leaning on him, immediately breathed out her life. Still much other wondrous things were to be seen there, and the evil lasted three full years, and was afterward driven out.

It was probably one of those kobolds at play here, who brought this woman, who was most likely innocent, to misfortune. The Brigittines at Fanten were likewise visited with manifold demonic plagues. Jumping about, they sometimes uttered a roaring and frightful noise; they were at times driven out of their appointed seats in the church, and their veils torn off; also their throats were sometimes closed so that they could take no food. The manifold changing and harsh affliction lasted among most of them for ten years. The cause was sought in a maiden who had formerly been inflamed with love for a youth whom her parents would not admit into their kinship. As she was now in great sorrow on this account, the demon persuaded her, in the form of the youth, to take the vow in the convent, and she allowed herself to be clothed. Once received into the order, she was seized as if by a frenzy and gave all a horrible, manifold changing spectacle. Her affliction now communicated itself, like a contagion, to many other sisters; who then, based on her own confession, held her to be the cause of all their misery.

With her, who was subsequently captured and taken away, the jailer begot two children; she was then released, and lived on, burdened with the suspicion of maleficium. The matter had occurred a considerable time before in Marienbaum; he therefore wrote for information to a nun there, and she replied: there were still two nearly eighty-year-olds from that time remaining, and from them she had often heard talk of it. They said: for much would they not have wished to forgo this heavy misfortune, ordained by God; because they had felt what gifts of grace and enlightenment had been granted to them from it; which their lives also bore witness to. At that time many learned people had been sent for, who had closely examined the terrible appearances, and attempted to penetrate into their interior and to provide help. But the more trust one placed in their advice, the more violent the evil became. \[Page 247\]

Then the afflicted finally recognized the matter as God's work; submitting themselves from the whole heart to his mighty arm, and completely denying themselves, they had ordered their lives according to God's Word, and now the evil gradually vanished. Wier adds: how he himself had visited the convent, and made inquiry with one of the old women who had borne the evil for ten years. She likewise praised God for it, and said: that she, if age permitted, would gladly let the same floods of misfortune pass over her once more. She counseled me: that if I should ever be consulted by such sufferers, I should certainly never permit exorcism. One who was such a suffering sister was, on the advice of some, beaten with rods by her brother; as madmen still advise today, as if the demon could be driven out with rods. She, however, from shame and displeasure, gradually wasted away: but in dying she sang; and when asked about the cause of her singing, she answered: because she did not doubt her eternal salvation. Another, long since plagued by the demon and near to death, offered herself entirely to God in her prayer, that he might do with her according to his will in time and eternity, provided only that his name be praised; and she asked her remaining sisters, after her death, not to sing the Miserere in the usual manner, but the Gloria Patri.

The Hollander Hoofft, in his Netherlandish histories, describes under the year 1566 the following occurrence in the orphanage of Amsterdam, which we supplement in some circumstances from other reports. "At this time the evil spirit plagued the poor children in that city in such a manner with all manner of temptations that the fancies from it, although he sometimes withdrew from them, did not leave their brains for as long as they lived. The greater part of them---there were about seventy in the house---were possessed by evil spirits, and were plagued and tormented in manifold ways. They climbed like cats up walls and roofs. Their faces, when they began to grow angry, they distorted so hideously and gruesomely that, if one looked upon them, even the most stouthearted man's hair stood on end. Often they ran toward the water as if they intended to drown themselves; but as soon as they reached the edge of it, they stood stock-still and said: The great man (as they were wont to call God) will not permit it. In general, whenever they wished to do something evil but could not bring it to pass, they always said: that the great man forbade it. They spoke, in the expression of Laurenz Regals, with playing tongues, all sorts of foreign languages which they had yet never learned; and they knew---what astonished people the most---to recount what was being handled at that very moment in the town hall. \[Page 248\]

Reaal reports on it: one of the children, in a fit, told the orphanage mother Catharina Gereits that the council was still assembled and had just resolved to send her son Johann Claeß to The Hague. It was found that this was indeed the resolution. The council had indeed deliberated on it and withdrawn the sending; but the child had nonetheless seen correctly. In their possession, the children were accustomed to raging and raving terribly, especially before the doors of certain women. In particular, one named Bametie was hateful to them; they unanimously accused her of having bewitched them, and against her they now poured out all their malice; so that these women were always held suspect on that account and cried out as sorceresses. But this suspicion fell most heavily on Bametie, because she was already blamed for having been out many times at night to practice her juggling or sorcery. Moreover, she had also been found many times in the Holy Ghost Chapel (Amsterdam was still Catholic in its government at that time) as if dead and entranced, with hands and feet spread wide apart, stretched out on the floor before the altar; and she would then come back to herself after several hours out of this ecstasy, with deep-drawn sighs.

The aforementioned orphans, when they had climbed up the tower of the old church like cats and played on the carillon bells with their fingers, were accustomed to sing in loud voices from her: We will not go away from here until we see Bametie sitting in the fire. At times they also pointed with their fingers at a spot, as if they wanted to show the bystanders the witch; who, however, was then of course not to be seen despite all efforts, although the children cried: she had just come there to do them some harm. They were also, no one knew why, exceedingly enraged against the schultheiß, reviling and scolding him harshly, and calling him a Deventer cake; either on account of his long, lean figure, or because he let them open their mouths with this children's fare to stop their scolding. ---

The children slept together in one hall, and thus the contagion can easily be understood. But one also sees clearly in this case: that the infected, when no visible center is present from which their evil has proceeded, seek out such a one for themselves; around which they then unite. It is understandable that a center of this sort must have an analogous state dwelling in it to their own, and that seems to have been the case with this woman. She had, as it is written, convulsions; whether these were of a higher mystical kind, or demonic, has not been ascertained. Probably, if we give weight to her evil reputation, brought about by her nocturnal outings, they alternated intermittently with one another; whereupon the possessed held to those corresponding to them. As, moreover, in the higher order of things, connections form themselves in love and attractive instincts; so in this lower one through hatred and repulsion; the choruses are thus scolding, armed against their choir leader, and striving against him.

Something over a hundred years later, in the orphanage of Hoorn in 1670, something quite similar occurred. At that time in this house there was a very large number of children, --- both boys and girls, older and younger, but none under twelve years, and mostly all of the most unruly sort ---, afflicted for several months with a severe plague; on account of which many doctors were consulted, who did not know what to make of the matter. \[Page 249\]

But the plague consisted in this: that the aforementioned children suddenly and unexpectedly fell to the ground, and as soon as they came to themselves, they were pulled and torn with such force that it was unbearable to witness: how they trampled with their legs, knocked their heads against the earth, struck about with their arms, gnashed their teeth, and howled and barked like dogs. In some, the belly rose and fell so violently that it seemed as if a living creature sat within it, which was moving; or as if little barrels were being rolled about in their bodies. They then had to be held by three, four, five, or sometimes even by six people; of whom one held the head, two others the hands, one sat on the legs, and sometimes a fourth had to press down the belly. When they lay still, they were stiff and rigid like wood; so that if one grasped them only by the head and the feet, one could carry them wherever one wished, without their making the slightest movement. This often lasted for several hours in succession, even into the night until twelve, one, or two o'clock.

One of them, the daughter of Tryn Lucas, one of the oldest orphans in the house, was seized by the plague early in the morning around eight, when the morning bell rang for breakfast. The attack lasted without any interruption until four in the afternoon, when the bell rang again for vespers. The sick girl thought, when she came to herself again, that she had only lain in the attack for a short time, because she believed she heard the morning bell ringing once more. These attacks most often came upon the children when they saw others seized by it; or also when they merely heard someone in the plague gnashing their teeth, or howling and barking. Some therefore were accustomed to run away at once, but mostly in vain; unless they happened to be near the gate and could leave the house. Thus, through hearing and seeing, so many often contracted it that there was scarcely enough household staff to be found to help them. Secondly, it also fell upon them very frequently, and almost always, during spiritual exercises, for example under the sermon, from which they therefore had to be kept away; then during the catechetical instruction, which the preachers gave in the house from time to time; but most of all during the prayers, which were recited aloud by the assistant masters. \[Page 250\]

The more earnest and fervent these prayers were, the more God was implored therein to curb the power of Satan; the worse the children had it, and they fell into the plague all the more. During the days of carnival, almost an entire week long, the afflicted were the most unbound and reckless children; indeed so unrestrained, as if they were full of fire and inner burning. Throughout the whole time they could not be tamed, and the plague was in this period, as it were, hidden and suspended. No remedy helped the children, except first of all prayer, which, at the request of the superintendents and the house mother, was constantly observed in all churches and assemblies by all except the Catholics. Furthermore, that the afflicted were allowed to live outside the house with other citizens. When they were away, they soon felt improvement, and the plague began gradually to diminish; so that they were all, sooner or later, delivered from it; except for two female persons, with whom the attacks later returned from time to time. The last case, which we shall here mention only in passing, is the one with the children in the institution that Bourignon established in Ryssel. There were about fifty of these children who received instruction and upbringing in the institute, and the matter seemed to be proceeding well; when the directress first noticed traces of the demonic in some children, and soon convinced herself that the evil was spread through the whole group. The children made their confessions to the pastor of St. Sauveur, and there the Sabbath reappears with its revelries, dances, and all its debaucheries.

These assemblies united, according to their own account, all estates: young and old, rich and poor, noble and ignoble, priests and laymen; and each took his place in due order, as his rank in the world brought with it. One confessed that from her youth she had had a spirit which had grown up with her, and remained with her day and night. Her malice was here chiefly directed against the mistress herself, over whom once an assembly of 25 persons had been held to find means of removing her from the way. Here too, without doubt, a pestilence had come among the children; the essential moments were present, as in other cases; but the matter was taken from the viewpoint of the school. They were those Arcadian shepherds of the old, earnest Sabbath who had gathered together; and now, in childish fashion, boasting of things inaccessible to them, they imitated them among themselves as best they could; much like how they in play practiced handiwork, or behind the drum rehearsed the work of war. \[Page 251\]

If one surveys the whole of the cases cited here, then it cannot hide itself from us: that the Sabbath is a Fata Morgana of the surrounding world of things; only with the difference that the reflection does not occur from the solid into the airy, and is therefore an optical illusion; but that it proceeds from the tangible physical into the spiritual psychic, thus having a real reality within itself; so that in such cases one could with equal right also call the physical the Fata Morgana of the Sabbath. We have already seen it in the nuns of Louviers, how they were exercised in all the horrors of that assembly; which then in the hellish sleep were merely delivered from the burden of the cooperating, but by no means absolutely necessary, matter, in order to stand forth at once in naked spiritual deliverance as it were demons. Just so does the cyclic nature of the Sabbath show itself, in all the cases cited, in the rounded connections of communal contagion. In the midst of the choruses of these fellowships stands guilt, in its personality, as chorus leader; and the complicity binds all around it in their round dance, and a discordant rhythm holds them in their formal formlessness. Hence the solidary obligation of those thus afflicted; if one of the nuns of Kentorp was seized by the attack, then it immediately entered all the others; and if the orphans of Amsterdam saw one from their midst seized, then the like-tuned string immediately resonated in them as well.

For all the members were one in that one whom they had taken as their master, or who had chosen them as his organs; and thus they were also at one with each other, and one felt himself in the other. Their bond was thus a Sabbath in the flesh; it required only a reversal of the vital relations to represent it at once in the spirit; and that ease with which the seized climbed up towers, trees, walls, was what stood at the transition from one state to the other in the excursion. In the representation of the ecstatic states, toward the light side, we have seen examples of how in the more earnest times, in the midst of the fellowships of the Beguines, such states likewise passed over to all members of the same, as through spiritual transfusion; and how now all forms and degrees of these states emerged in the individuals, according to the stage they had reached. Here was a different center, around which the Lord a different bond was closed; and this one invited his own into his wine press, where the jars of his must stood sealed, but not with lust, rather with pains. \[Page 252\]

These were the counter-alliances, set against the demon's followers; and if these, as in Kentorp, showed themselves hostile to all earnest, religious endeavor, and devoted to vain pursuits and mockery; or as in Hoorn, averse to prayer, but given over to mummery and masquerade to the utmost excess; then among the others the opposite sympathies and antipathies would prevail. The role that the hammer-wielders perform on the Sabbath is here fulfilled by the kobolds, who mingle in the throng, perpetrate their mischief, torment the afflicted even more severely, and increase the confusion in every way. Just as the forces of nature sometimes break into society, and in secular, epidemic, and endemic diseases form whirlwinds in their midst, in which they rule and command; so do the psychic powers in these formations, which veer toward the good or evil side, divide themselves again according to the day or night aspect. But that such hauntings by no means necessarily have a fault as their ground is best shown by the example of the Brigittines in Tanten, who, as long as they kicked against the pricks, saw their affliction multiplied; and only after they had submitted in resignation did they see it turn into an asceticism, which, once it had fulfilled its purpose, was taken from them.

### Chapter 3. Vital Relations

Life, which stands open to the most palpable things in creation, also most frequently allows possession to take hold; and thus serves most often the seizing entity as the ground and bearer into which it enters, and from which it then, as much as is permitted to it, overlays the rest of the person. But the outer ground of life is split and divided into multiplicity, and many levels of life are arranged one above the other, and grouped around certain vital central points. The occupation, whether the involuntary one or the one deliberately brought about, will therefore articulate itself in the same way, and can then appear multiply divided. We have already spoken of this multiplicity in connection with possession; here we encounter it again, and we must discuss it once more from another viewpoint.

Father J. J. Surin, a man of deep inner life, has recorded some observations on this from his own experience. His provincial had sent him to Loudun to become the confessor of the possessed nuns there; at a time when the main scenes of the drama there had already passed. In his life¹ it is said of the chief person among them, Mother Johanna: there were four demons that held her in possession. \"Balaam had entrenched himself in her humor, her temperament was the playground in which he operated; and since she was by nature very merry, he did nothing but play pranks; he spoke of eating, drinking, and other pleasures, which then drew her mind away from all contrition and made her averse to all divine things.

Isaacaron spoke of nothing but carnal delights and impurities. Behemoth had seated himself in the wrathful part, hurled a multitude of blasphemies about, and spoke of nothing but planned misdeeds, murder, and manslaughter. The fourth, Leviathan, had seated himself in pride, and haughtiness, boasting, and ostentatious display were his constant occupation. He sometimes gave her a proud bearing, so that she appeared resplendent like an abbess; she then spoke with head held high in pride of wondrous things; she knew the holy fathers, and cited them with great understanding and penetrating eloquence. She kept herself neat in her attire, and had a majestic appearance; while a thousand jests and vanities swirled in her head.\" \[Page 253\]

Their spirits sometimes bestowed upon her a greater beauty than she possessed by nature; especially a loveliness in her gestures, in her bearing and her speech, and an unusual radiance and shining in her eyes.\"

The names mentioned here and everywhere in such cases are conventional, designating the vices, which also alone fall into the circle of deeply inwardly signifying appellations. Three of these demons are now the three principal powers and dominions of the evil signature, toward which human life inclines itself: Balaam, the frivolous mocker and jester; Isacaron, the foul-mouthed teller of obscenities; Behemoth, the wrathful rager and the tearing beast in man. The fourth, however, Leviathan, the arrogant braggart, does indeed rise above these lower regions; but only borne upon the forces that dwell within them, and in which it ever strives to elevate itself above itself, carried to their highest pinnacles. The seat of this life is, however, as we know, the ganglionic system, in its entire extension gathered around certain central points, and the lower principal center laid in the abdominal cerebrum. This nerve-cluster is heaped from twelve ganglia, which pairwise, according to the division into the right and left halves of the body, are thus divided into six pairs forming all the functions of this life.

The uppermost of these six pairs, passing upward into the lung ganglia, appears destined for the life of the breast and lungs; the middle one, as it spreads into the spleen and liver, devoted to these organs and their specific mode of life; a lower one to the genital organs and their functions. The three other pairs appear assigned to the stomach, the organ of this kind of ingestion, as well as to the egestion in the intestinal-anal region and the kidneys. Above all these lower central points, ordered around a middle, there then hover the heart ganglia, as the once-more centering, upward-mediating unification. If any life is now demonically seized, then the incursion must occur into that center whose system appears most affected by the specific mode of the seizure.

There, therefore, to speak in the language of the exorcists, the demon has his seat; the systems that depend from this center fall, from the side of nature, into a profound dormancy; but from the pairs of ganglia outward, this one is demonized by the principle dwelling there. Balaam, therefore, the frivolous, teasing jester, has his seat in that pair of ganglia directed upward, and in the ganglionic plexuses subordinate to it; which serves those systems in which the bright, clear, warm arterial blood is prepared, and the corresponding vital spirit is drawn off; which is therefore the seat of all that is sanguine, light, fleeting, bird-like in man. Behemoth, the wrath-grim one, who thinks only bloody thoughts of murder, and with fury blasphemes every power that restrictingly opposes him; will dwell in that middle pair, and indeed first and foremost in the ganglion that governs the liver.

But as the spleen connects itself with the liver, although complementarily in opposition, so will this spirit of wrath also have two sides. To the flaming one there will be opposed an inward-devouring; to the atrabilious one a stagnating in black spleen-sickness, a self-consuming in melancholy, which vents itself in the spleen ganglion. Both will dominate the system of the black blood and the nocturnal vital spirits in man. Finally, Isacaron or Asmodeus will set up the throne of his dominion in the ganglia that form the center in the genital organs, and from there rule over the flesh; while Leviathan, the spirit of pride, from the heart-center works over into the higher organs of the brain, and inflames them in pride. \[Page 254\]

If we add to these four pure spirits the spirit of gluttony and voracity, of gormandizing and greediness, which dwell in the three remaining pairs of ganglia of the life-system; then the hierarchy of these spirits is closed and rounded off, the vicissitudes are exhausted, and the path for our contemplation is marked out. The sphere of action of these life-spirits properly belongs still to the second region of man; but because they root in the third, and as regards their lower principle belong to it, therefore they are most fittingly dealt with in it, and as its regents can also most fittingly serve us as guides in these domains.

But if we now consider the order and relation of these fundamental drives to one another; then we find the drive to generation, the destructive drive, and the balancing life-drive as the truly root-like forces of all life. Life, once posited, maintains itself through a regulated process of preservation; which appears under the form of an augmenting act of self-generation. Since for this the duality of the sexes belongs, it is inwardly divided in this dualism; and according as the one or the other prevails, the engendering sex alone steps forth outwardly. This dualism, which is ever complementing itself, would now from within ceaselessly continue to generate, and multiply itself through ongoing accretion without end; were it not that another dualism is added to this one, which stands in contrarian opposition to that first one. This second dualism can be none other than the dualism of death: as death forming the counterforce to life, and because this life divides itself in sex, dividing itself antagonistically. Thus to the positively generating life there stands opposed a positively life-limiting death, which manifests itself through actively incisive, wrathful blood-lust; to the femininely receptive life, that negative side of the self-destruction drive, the mother of death, who does not beget him but receives and bears him. \[Page 255\]

This self-destructive drive and that self-preservative drive, if left free to themselves, would now simply annul one another; were it not for a third force above them, which rules both, preserves both in their existence, moderates them and balances them against each other; so that from their counteraction a product, the overall structure of life, can emerge. This preservative force dwells in the innermost unity and the center of life, and intervenes in those double dualisms; it maintains the members of each in equilibrium against one another, so that they mutually complement each other; and it ordains the one against the other, so that they reciprocally limit each other, and thus a limited product comes about. This threefold compounded process now repeats itself three times in organic life. For the first time in the lowest region, in the organic domain of the white, chylous blood. Life, here thrusting its palisade-root across into nature, receives the material from it; not merely admitting it mechanically, but opening itself to it with selection. But it also gives of its own to the received; thus enlivening it with this, yet it also kills what has served its purpose; in that the eating-greed toward the to-be-taken-up and to-be-assimilated is met by a blood-lust against what is already taken up; and in that both split themselves according to expulsion and reception, the life-unity steps in moderating and boundary-setting; and so between ingestion and egestion, in the organic system of the roots and root-leaves on the lowest level, the assimilation into white blood is completed. Upon the second level this process ascends, in the organic focus of the black blood, in the portal-vein system. A new assimilation is here undertaken, and the central points of the assimilating activities are expressed in the liver and the spleen.

The result of the previous process is here grasped with choice, and spread out in the spleen, as the organ of the negative preservation drive; while the positive one presses itself together into the liver. In these same organs, however, the destructive principle of death is also housed; in the one, setting its self-sunken melancholy against the richness of the material; in the other, by its bursting forth in rage's fury, inhibiting the productivity of positive life. But in that the heart, which is everywhere in life, through its power holds asunder and joins together with measure; after the egestion has carried out the killed as bile, the ingested chylous white blood, in the cooperation of the preservation drives, is transformed into black blood.

This immediately enters the third life region into the third process, and must undergo a third transformation in the lungs, which reshapes it into light, arterial blood. To these functions, as they fall apart into a venous and an arterial pair, the double dualism of the generative and the forces of annihilation is indeed imparted; and as the heart, lying entirely in their proximity, again holds the two dualities in itself and to itself in measure and in right order; life works in them heightening, elevating, and introducing and reproducing into an upper region; while death, on the other side, in something opposed to the generative act, disembodies the consumed, depresses it, and, killing it as to matter as well as force, casts it out in exhalation into the surrounding circles. \[Page 256\]

Thus in this process the light, warm, brightly reddened blood is prepared, in which the whole freshness of life, and the germ of higher formations, dwell, and which spreads itself through all life organs. In it the colored blossom of the tree of life will have unfolded itself, which has displayed its leafy richness in the second region, as in the lowest it has only first unfolded itself into the cotyledons. And what is now in such a way secretly hidden in itself building up the organism, that now, going asunder outward, gives itself openly and without covering to be recognized. The lowest process enters into rapport with external nature in the glandular system, the breasts of the organism sitting downward upon nature, in which milk has been prepared for life, from which it prepares its own subsistence; and as in the Indian Trimurti, Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu are life-creators.

#### A. The Demonization of the Nourishment Drive

In the nourishment drive the lowest rapports of the higher organic life with the deeper animated natures take place, thus from life to life intertwined across. Love is in it as appetite, hate as disgust; it has its lust and dis- lust laid out in the whole ladder of stages of tastes and distaste; its irascible drives lie in the zealous anger, which first kills life, before then transforming the killed: its antipathies reveal themselves in the excretions, and its sympathies give notice of themselves in the attachments of the assimilated mat- ter. All these elements can be driven to the extreme, and are then prepared for reversal; when this then happens in the interest of the evil sought with premeditation, and under its cooperation and its incubation; then obsession can occur, as we have seen that possession often occurs accidentally. If here it has been a poisonous plant that the grazing animal in man, among other nourishing herbs, has found on the meadow, and against which no instinct has warned him; then there it is the Eucharist of the demon, which he has sought, for which he has prepared himself, and to which he has gone with premeditation; imagining that he wins life, but in truth taking death into himself. The lust heightened beyond all measure will, under the various drives of that order, first initiate this process; and to the fruits, which are beautiful in appearance and good to eat, gluttony will first lead over.

She will then awaken the zeal of anger, so that it turns destructively, instead of against the harmful, against the nourishing and strengthening; and since the likewise perverted antipathy likewise casts it out, only the unhealthy will be assimilated and permanently incorporated. An example will suffice to make the entire process clear to us. Bekker¹ tells it from his own experience, to be sure in his superficial, arbitrarily rational manner; but nevertheless circumstantially enough to serve our purpose. A young man, about 16 years old, of dull comprehension, mentally and physically not of particular drive or vigor, had become conspicuous to his fellow pupils: through the strange gestures, eye-rollings and contortions of his body, which manifested themselves in him. He had let them eat ripe cherries in the middle of winter; and after first offering them to them, he had then eaten them himself. In the church he had shown them his empty hands, and then taken money from the pews, and asserted: that he did all this with the help of an evil spirit, which he called Serug. \[Page 257\]

They had once caught him at it, how he had drawn a circle with chalk in the school, and described it with some figures and numbers, which Bekker had seen. On being asked: what does that mean? he had stood long silent and still, and blinked with his eyes; but finally confessed: that he had drawn it to speak with him through it. Likewise, when asked: how he had come by the cherries and the money? he had replied, that he had given it to him. Asked: who this he might be? he had, blinking again and looking in front of him, named Beelzebub. Into a hole in the wall, which according to the rector's deputy was much too small to admit his hand, he had nevertheless thrust it in, and upon pulling it out had torn a stone along with it. More sharply questioned, he explained: that the spirit sometimes appeared to him, now agreeably as a maiden, now repulsively as a goat; that it had happened to him for the first time in Leeuwarden, where money for playing had been lacking to him, and that he had given him a handwriting.

The school authorities resolved to exclude him from it, and to inform the parents of the matter; who now agreed upon it, to keep him at home. A maid watched over him during the day, wherever he went and stood; at night he slept with his brother, who was a clever man, and entirely capable for this guardianship. They prayed for him in the church; the maid was accustomed to seat him in front of the pulpit, where he was exposed to the eyes of many people as well as the preacher. There he would then sit stiffly looking in front of him, often blinking, more frequently shaking with his feet, like one who is freezing, and suffering from a twitching of the sinews, as epileptics are wont to have; without, however, ever having fallen in the church.

The maid knew much to tell about him, but this rested only on her belief; because the father, who loved solitude, mostly remained in his chamber; but the mother, although very sensible and attentive, was very burdened with bodily weakness. He presented himself to Bekker as if he felt remorse and sorrow, but took no heart toward the one who scolded him more often; for which reason this one henceforth spoke more kindly with him, and once took him, with the prior knowledge of the parents, on a walk; after having previously bought him some sweets for him, with which, as he very well knew, his trust was most easily to be gained. He now told him on this walk: how his spirit Serug still kept him company, and spoke invisibly with him in various shapes; and that he, in order not to be tormented, still sometimes yielded to him in evil.

He wanted to lure him out continually, and although he had little desire for it, he had nevertheless been very well entertained by him twice at special places: first in the little house by the gallows at Leeuwarden, which then transformed into a beautiful hall; and then in Franeker, on the first piece of pastureland that lies northward from the road by the city moat. There was a pit there, which, except on the hottest summer days, is otherwise mostly full of water; that pit had suddenly dried up at that time, and been full of fiery flames. In it many devils had been flying about, who declared that hell indeed had such a fire as well; but they knew how to render it harmless. To a company of men and women who had been there, splendid fare had been served; there had also been music, dancing, and games. \[Page 258\]

People had spoken Hebrew there; a language which he understood as well as his mother tongue, but outside the assembly not at all. He named those present, among others a woman from Leeuwarden who already had a reputation for this. At night, after he had slept a little, his spirit would make him rise; and lead him along a height which he never saw by day, to that place. Once he had brought him to the sea dike at Harlingen, and made him thrust through two men with the sword that he had placed in his hand. Bekker asked: whether he remembered any Hebrew word at all? He said: Yes, one, "alley," which I use when I want to call him. Bekker replied: that is no Hebrew word, and wrote for him on a small coin the words: *Soer nimmenin Satan! Depart from me, Satan!* with the instruction: to ask the devil about the meaning of the words; and instead of the few shillings that he always used to give him, to demand from him a Hungarian double ducat.

He later reported back: that he had shown the words to the devil, and he had told him that they meant: he should go away from him; but the double ducat he had promised him if he would only first go out; but that he had neither been able nor willing to do. His parents had told Bekker that he sometimes fell into a faint, and then told much about the places where he had been. He asked to be called if it happened again, and now found him once lying flat on the ground, rolling about on it; holding his eyes now closed, now stiffly open; his body mostly drawn together, and in violent motion. After that he came to himself again, and began to speak weakly, but gave little account, except that he was better; though later on he knew how to tell much again.

Once around the summer solstice, when his brother awoke early in the morning, he saw him lying next to him in bed; with closed eyes in sleep, making all the movements of the mouth, the hands, and the body like one who greedily eats and drinks there. He named now the name of Serug, now of another spirit; and demanded this and that from one or the other tree. He then acted like one who receives something and bites into it; he praised the same and laughed, as if it tasted good to him. Finally, when he received something that did not taste good to him, he scolded his spirit vehemently, something like with the words: Now you deceive me again, and give me what you well know that I do not want at all! With that he drew back, and struck with the flat of his hand so forcefully that a mark of it could be seen on the wall, and from the rebound of it he half awoke. Only when he parted from the meal in the pleasure garden did he clearly make the gesture of taking off the garments that he had received there; and that he had to leave behind, in order to go home in his own clothes. He now got up, really dressed himself, and performed his prayer. The brother then said: You were absent the night, where have you been after all? \[Page 259\]

He denied it at first, and now related, under the seal of confidentiality: that he had been in a most beautiful garden, full of delicious fruits, in good company, and so forth. The brother now sought to make it clear to him from what he had seen that it had only been fantasies; but he could not be persuaded, and instead asserted that the brother had only seen his semblance. Moreover, he must have had great bodily flexibility to wriggle through everywhere. Once Bekter was called into his house, where he found the entire household in consternation. He had gone out onto the street in a moment when the maid had turned her back; and when they searched for him, he met the maid on her return from the baker's, where he had bought and paid for something.

No one could comprehend how he had gotten out; the doors were locked from the inside, and the courtyard door was barred; he had not been in front, and had not gone through the courtyard, that much they knew. He would say nothing, but finally pointed out two missing bricks in the roof, toward a roof beam; through that the spirit had led him. In the rear building there was a cellar opening under a bedstead, which without bed and straw was covered only with bare planks, on which 2--3 wash tubs lay. The mother found him in the cellar, the doors locked, and the wash tubs in their place. One sees from this account: the nature that was at play here was of limited intellect; but of a nervous, spasmodic, easily agitated, almost epileptic constitution, which made him capable of every extreme. At the same time, he was physically extremely supple, and as his hand had reached into the narrow opening in the wall; so his body through the one in the roof.

His predominant drive was that gluttony which had already manifested in his early youth with the cherries that Better exploited; and which reappeared when he escaped from supervision in a mysterious manner. That constitution brought on frequent crises that threw him to the ground; but in the midst of the convulsive movements awakened the somnambulism in him. The modality of this state was determined by the ruling drive; banquets, gardens with costly fruits that could satisfy him, were the forms in which the vision made itself known. During his earlier stay in Leeuwarden he had probably 393 come into contact with people who gave the matter a demonic direction; at least Bekker relates that at first a man had been sent to him from there as a guard, who also had the reputation of having been sorely plagued by the devil; but who left again because he seemed even more confused than the young man. \[Page 260\]

Through this it came about that the visions took on entirely the form of the Sabbath vision; predominantly expressed in the shape of the banquet. The degenerate instinct for nourishment had here acted as the pimp; it had led him into those circles to seek satisfaction in them, and to find them in the substitution of inner enjoyments for the outer ones. As grossly sensual as the relationship had been in its root, it may also in its development have risen little above this sphere; tricks and lies had probably, as usual, been added. But it is not necessary to reject the whole as a deliberate deception by the man, as Bekker did in his narrow-minded way; basing himself on the explanation he gave when he later wished to be admitted into the society of the Labadists, and now testified: that it had all been mere fiction, and that he had never seen or heard devils. We have already encountered such explanations with new protestations to the contrary more than once; they rest on the split between body and soul that stands out clearly in such states, and never allows a full and secure conviction as to the reality or ideality of the appearances.

##### i. The Demonic Aberration of the Instinct for Nourishment Downward.

The drive for nutrition, directed toward organic nature for its satisfaction, has in the previous case strayed into the inner spiritual realms; and thus remained unsated in its bodily element. But there is yet another aberration of this drive, where the same, instead of deviating---as there---beyond the natural midpoint, sinks below it, and seeks its satisfaction in the deeper, inorganic realms. The reports of sorcery are full of incidents where those deemed bewitched, or who were in a state of possession, have vomited up utterly inedible objects: hairs, stones, pieces of wood, metals in various forms. Fraud has played its part in this, and such phenomena have been artificially produced; but enough facts remain where, through the application of all caution, fraud has been rendered impossible; and thus a natural process must underlie them, which demands explanation.

All those objects contradict the natural instinct, which is stationed at all the gates of life and stands guard there, to keep the harmful from entering. These instincts must therefore have either been lulled to sleep, or deceived by an illusion that presented the objects to them as edible. The objects often appear not merely threatening to life through their composition; but also through form and mass, scarcely capable---in the ordinary relations of life---of admission and passage through the narrow pathways. There must thus be a condition that allows their intake, in which these pathways open wider, and forces manifest themselves within them that are capable of enforcing this opening; and which may then also drive them out again in the sequel. That is what emerges from the superficial consideration of the fact presupposed as true. Let us now consider some facts of this kind, partly to confirm this truth, partly to derive from them the nearer consequences. \[Page 261\]

One of the oldest facts of this class, of which reports exist, is that which occurred in Lyon. Gaufried, Abbot of Altatuba, reports in the life of the holy Peter Tarantaise---which he, at the command of Pope Lucius, was commissioned by the abbots of Cîteaux and Clairvaux to write: At the castle of Lugdunum there was a pious man who had a daughter bewitched by a woman, suffering from a desperate illness, who could endure neither her husband's presence nor even his sight. Her mother had therefore summoned a known sorcerer to her. He had examined the matter, declared her bewitched, rubbed tree bark, and herbs incantated with words, and administered them to her in a cup; finally, he also gave her a bite in the arm. The woman now partook of her ailment, but from that time on it was as if needles were pressing out from her heart from time to time. She then suffered violent pains, until through the bite in the arm---which did not scar over---needles were driven forth by a secret force. More than thirty of them had thus emerged one after another; when a famous abbot, whom Gaufried, because he was still alive, hesitates to name, passed by on his way, and under the hospitable roof of the father was received, saw the sick woman, and heard her misery recounted by the distressed father.

The account was immediately confirmed by the evidence of the eyes, as the woman anew felt a needle painfully; in a short time it had advanced to the opening, and soon some blood, then the needle itself, appeared. It was soon pushed further forward, and now a lay brother in the abbot's retinue approached, grasped the protruding one, and drew it out bloody, to preserve it for all time to come as a witness to what had occurred. The abbot betook himself to prayer, and touching the wound, said in the power of faith: henceforth neither iron nor steel shall come forth here. It happened thus, but the matter had only changed, because the power of the sorcery was not yet entirely broken. \[Page 262\]

Now there came forth, namely, small wooden splinters or pegs of oak or ash wood, thicker than thorns and a little longer, in place of the needles; however, they were no more of equal length than those had been. Sixteen such had, in the course of a year and fewer months, come from the woman; when finally the holy Peter Tarantusius, to whom this miracle had been reserved, arrived on the scene. The woman was presented to him, as he had ordered the evening before, while he offered the Mass. At that hour the seventeenth peg went from her, which the sacristan drew forth before the eyes of all. The woman went to confession with the saint, received absolution, and after he had administered the Eucharist to her, he bade her be calm; henceforth no matter of any kind would go from her in such a manner. Freed from all enchantment, she lived thereafter with her husband, bore him children; and, as it is said, still alive at the time of this writing, she praises the wondrous power by which she had been deemed worthy to be tried. Peter de Frarineto is called her father, known and honored by all the inhabitants of his place---this is said here; thus ends Gaufried the account, so that if anyone harbors doubt about the event, he may seek conviction from what he is unwilling to believe.

Since then, one has had all too frequent occasion to observe similar events; in some cases fraud has been discovered therein, but others exclude such an interpretation entirely by the circumstances. So the case that Dr. H. ab Heer cites in Observ. VIII. A nine-year-old child had, in May 1625 at Utrecht, taken a sorrel leaf into its mouth, which a woman had offered it, and thereupon felt such pains that it fell down as if dead. Since no medicine helped, it had been exorcised; and now needles, glass, feathers, hairs, nails had burst forth; and it was noticed: as often as that woman approached it within 200 paces, it was each time more severely tormented. She was later arrested and condemned, and with the noose around her neck, confessed herself guilty of the child's harm. This was now brought to Dr. Heer in mid-September, and remained with him for some weeks; and he now relates simply and plainly what he observed in it during that time. \[Page 263\]

He had summoned the Father Modestus of Liège. When this one was still 50 paces distant from the room, the child fell down as if dead; no breath could be felt in it, the fingers and toes were so twisted together that I could not separate them with anything. When the Capuchins began to read the exorcism, the child moved with such violence that six persons present could not hold it still; I myself had grasped its head, and felt how it was drawn, through an inner convulsion, with the nape ever against the shoulders. Meanwhile the body swelled up beyond all measure, and at ten paces distant a sound could be heard from it, as when the unruly waves strike against the forepart of a ship; and the child again burst forth from time to time with those objects. I begged the exorcists, out of pity, to pause. They had scarcely spoken the last word when the sufferer lay still; and when they had departed, the hands and feet unclasped; it soon stood up, ate and drank, and played, as if nothing had happened. This repeated itself always; but when I saw that the ejected things were completely dry, I expressed my doubts to those present. The child now cried: Do not doubt that these things come from me! With that it seized my hand and led it into its throat. Feel, it said, a headless pin, which will come forth at once! I really felt it; but when I thought to grasp it firmly between the fingers of my left hand in its throat, it was torn away from me with force; the child, however, now bent over to vomit, and I received it into my hand.

I have at other times often felt the points at the mouth of the stomach; and when they now came up, then many who wanted to perform experiments meant that they could hold the end of the point fast in the middle of their throat; but all their efforts were each time thwarted. --- Heer healed, more than a year later, the child with an ointment from the hazel bush, which he had found in Carrichter; and the healed one was completely well three years later, only that every year during the Lenten season a melancholy would come over her. In Wiers's time, the ailment seems to have spread epidemically along the Lower Rhine; for whole wagonloads of such afflicted people were brought to him in Cleves. He examined them medically, but could never feel any of the hard objects in the lower abdomen before the vomiting. In more recent times something similar happened with Maria von Mörk in Caltern; at that time, when the conflict within her had not yet been resolved, she too had to endure this temptation.

She began on July 25, 1832, with an unnatural cheerfulness, which, except for the communion days, otherwise continued uninterrupted until the middle of September. In this state she committed various foolish acts, no longer called even her best acquaintances by their names, gnawed with great haste at her own hands as well as at those of others; and wept when one tried to deny it to her. From time to time she would then cry out in the midst of this frenzy: O my God! O, what misery is this! When she came to herself again in lucid intervals, she knew nothing of what she had said and done; and when her siblings made her aware of it, at most a dim recollection of it would dawn on her, and she showed herself extremely dismayed by it. \[Page 264\]

This agitation, whose focal point, as the gnawing reveals, had been in the plexuses of the stomach region, had entered only in the company of a new affliction, which had begun on the same day. For on the aforementioned day, one first noticed in her mouth lumps or pins and other similar things; on which she bit vigorously, and which she gave up again only after long efforts. This phenomenon repeated itself daily in frightful manner two to three times, and continued for eight long weeks until the middle of September. Pins, needles, spirally twisted wires, pieces of glass, horsehairs, nails of all kinds came forth one after another. Most came out of the mouth, following a stabbing pain that she felt in her entrails; whereupon these objects were immediately vomited up amid violent convulsions. The confessor, dismayed by these events, could scarcely bring himself to credit the evidence of his eyes; he therefore reported what had occurred to the parish priest of the place at that time, Mr. Eberl. This man had visited her more often earlier; her appearance had never led him to suspect any unusual state that had come over her.

When, therefore, the occurrence was reported to him, he must have felt struck by the communication; and, as was natural, he expressed his doubts about the truth of the strange things, and how perhaps some deception might have crept in. When it was replied in the meantime that similar doubts had also arisen earlier with the confessor, but that he had been compelled to yield before the evidence of the facts; he went there to take insight into the event himself. He found the afflicted one in violent convulsions; she threw herself, when the crisis approached, backward over the pillows; and since her mouth stood open thereby, one could easily see deep down into the gullet. The priest now had more than one opportunity to observe how the objects were driven up in it, sometimes placing themselves crosswise, resisting the expulsion; and gradually forced higher and higher up, finally entering the mouth, and then, as if blown out by a wind, being expelled.

Initially fearful, he soon gathered courage at the confessor's urging; and whenever he again caught sight of such objects---needles, nails, or pieces of wood---he reached into the gullet and drew them out deeply, so that any possibility of deception was entirely ruled out. To this day he still preserves many of the things that he thus helped bring to light.¹ Not only through the mouth did these objects leave her, but also through the lower passages; under great pain, the sharp things---as she called them in the local dialect---were expelled from her; and one could hear them, if metallic, clinking as they fell below. In the same way, similar objects emerged externally from her after she had felt the pain in her side or elsewhere, when she straightened up, as if they had forced their way through her skin. \[Page 265\]

In May of that year, a paralysis had set in at her left foot, so that she could not move it. In the following September, finally, a board nail more than three inches long worked its way through the skin of her leg, and the limb immediately regained its former flexibility. The same happened sometimes at the back between the shoulder blades; at other times, however, also at the head, where they opened a way out for themselves. It was remarkable in this that the straight pins did not advance, as would have been the case if they had been introduced from outside, with their heads turned outward; rather, the points were turned outward, so that, since they sat fast and could only be grasped with force, the confessor and others often wounded themselves bloody before they managed to pull them out. All these sharp and injurious objects caused her no bleeding, and left no suppurating wound behind; except when one had injured her through incautious removal of them. But once they were finally removed, the sufferer regained control of herself and felt greatly relieved.

Along with this phenomenon, there was also another closely related one, that of the strange infestation of the bed. On the bedsheet, under it on the mattress, on the straw tick, needles, straw stems, nails, hairs, pieces of glass, and so forth were found; and scarcely had the bed been cleaned when, sometimes in the presence of the very same persons who had removed the earlier objects, quite similar ones appeared in the same place, and the cleaning had to be repeated. As long as these bed infestations were around her, the sufferer found herself in such agitation and mental confusion that she not infrequently cried out with a distorted face, flashing eyes, and protruding tongue: she wanted to kill herself; she was damned anyway, she wanted to go with the men who were turning her bed topsy-turvy. Immediately afterward she would complain again of painful stinging in the eyes, in the lower body, on the chest; she howled and cried miserably, often tore out whole handfuls of hair, and wanted to jump violently from the bed out the window. It is noteworthy that the maids who made the bed never found the mentioned infestations; except when the confessor was present in the room. He had, as was natural, taken all precautions, as far as it was at all feasible, to keep such objects---as are usually found in the sweepings---away from her. All the women who approached her had been instructed to pay close attention to needles and whatever similar things they carried on them. But all caution proved useless; the things gathered around her, as if drawn to her. One day, as they were just cleaning the bed again, Marie suddenly began to tremble and called out quivering: Oh! Oh! The confessor asked: what was the matter?

Oh, she replied, now something ugly and large is coming and wants to get into my bed. In fact, one heard how something from the next room, continually striking against the floor, clattered through the open door toward the bed standing close by it. The confessor commanded: Seize it in the name of Jesus, and hand it here! Oh, she cried, it is already running away again, and now it is going into the next room! One of the girls present had the courage to follow it there and pick it up; and there it was found to be a piece of hard wood that had been wrapped with human hair, alternately striking the floor with one end and the other, thus coming along. \[Page 266\]

The confessor, dismayed by all these occurrences, inquired in many ways: how it could be that these strange objects came to her in this manner, and even pressed into her body; but she could give no definite information about it. She said: sometimes it seemed to her as if they entered through the eyes, sometimes again through the mouth; it also seemed to her at times as if they were thrown up against her breast and throat by a little man. Only this one thing was certain, and she maintained the same for a long time afterward: that each time abominable men of dark form surrounded her, and offered and presented to her shapes of various enjoyable objects and delicacies, chestnuts, pastries, and confections. Then she lusted after what was offered, and it was immediately forced upon her by the men; whereupon always violent stabbing and cutting pains would set in, until all that stuff was removed from the body again.

The whole matter had been sought to be concealed as much as possible on account of the sensation; but it came out nevertheless, at least in part, and the strangeness that lay in the entire occurrence made people suspicious; they suspected witchcraft and evil arts, and many who had previously wished well to the afflicted one withdrew from her. Therefore the confessor said to her one day: You see, Marie! how all these hideous things lead people astray; therefore turn yourself in fervent prayer to God, that he may take the plague from you. She promised to do as he had said; and then after some time, when she had gone to holy communion around the middle of September, she said: The Lord has said: I am to have the general prayer held for me in a church, then the torments will cease. But to you I am to vow strict obedience in all things; then you can forbid, in the future, accepting anything from the abominable men, and I shall remain freed. Both happened with the foretold success.

The plague was meanwhile not entirely at an end all at once. For a long time Marie still lamented that the dark men still stood at her bed, and wanted to give her abominable things to put her to death. Once also, when through convulsions her mouth was forced open, three needles were thrown at once into the open throat in the presence of the confessor. The one present heard the clinking of them, and at his command Marie immediately spat them out. Here too, fortunately, everything necessary for judging the phenomenon comes together again. One can follow the things with that walking piece of wood, as it were on their path, from all corners up to her; for there are busy forces around her that, in the manner of goblins, carry it to her from all sides. But the access to her is nevertheless barred to all that filth, until she herself has led her desire into it. \[Page 267\]

To this now approach the dark figures, tempting her with it, by clothing the rigid with the appearance of the enjoyable, indeed of the enticing deliciousness; so that it is not the stone, the metal, that---as in the temptation of the Lord---is to be transformed into bread within her; but rather, that it already appears in the deceptive form of bread, in order to open access to her; where it then, after the disappearance of the appearance, reveals itself again in its true form. She now, seduced by sensual lust, cannot resist the desire; and immediately bound by it, she gives those dark forces power over herself, to force upon her now the desired thing.

For the desire has arisen in the palate, and from there organically reflected upon the solar plexus as its focal point, and has organically assumed the form of a magnetic pull that has become irresistible through consent; and the direction of this pull goes toward the mouth and stomach and those plexuses. The objects therefore, seized by the magnetic attraction, are carried onward in this direction---like the Eucharist in the saints; and since they find the gate opened by the cramp, they are inhaled down to the stomach with unusual force. Through the access of the mouth, they have thus penetrated into the interior, but only into the relative interior; for even the spirits are not able to withdraw spatial objects from space, and to bring them again from the absolute interior---out of the spatial, say the organic---into it. But arrived there, they step forth in their peculiar, life-destroying form; the stinging and the pains in the entrails begin; but with that also simultaneously the counteraction of the life forces, which manifests itself in cramps and convulsions.

In the activity of these forces heightened in themselves, and strengthened through higher influence, now begins the opposite process of expelling the harmfulness once more. The needles are---as shown on the three that were thrown into her throat in the presence of the one witness---expelled, as if blown inward through the pull that arose in her; now they are, in the reversal, blown out again through a living repulsion. In the entrance they probably turned the points downward and inward; in the exit they will be directed reversed upward and outward. Since the desire found its beginning in the eye, it has often seemed to the afflicted as if they had taken their entrance beside the mouth also through this organ. The exit will likewise not be bound only to the mouth and intestinal canal; for it is an indwelling life force, in which the foreign objects are driven; and as this whole body is permeable, so it also drives that seized by it, in its current, without finding resistance, through all parts of the body toward the surface.

Dark figures have mediated the entrance as seducers; the expelling power will likewise sometimes appear personally, in the little helpful manikin that, working inside, throws them outward. Because they are not---through a mechanical force---mechanically expelled; but rather through a vital one, in a kind of secretion, discharged, the objects also leave no injury or suppuration behind. As the haunted one, through the power of obedience, has strengthened her will power, and thus made her consent more difficult; so the whole phenomenon also ceases, although from time to time some relapses return.

##### ii. Greed as Mediator of the Relations to the Metals.

As here gluttony has become the mediator between the warm life and the rigid death; so in another form an affect more akin to the metal, namely greed and avarice. Very significant from this side is what took place with Gertrud Fischer in Frankfurt on the Oder during the time of the Reformation. \[Page 268\]

The daughter of a man named Martini Fischer from Lebus; she had become weak in the head while with him, as the preacher Andreas Ebert of Frankfurt first made known in an open letter, whereupon a citizen of that city, Georg von Kulisch, took her in and had her cared for according to her needs for a long time, during which she became partly healthy again. But this recovery of hers soon changed again afterward, and her ailment grew worse and worse the longer it lasted; so that she became possessed by the enemy of truth, and began to do all manner of things.

Among other things, the preacher says, it happened thus: whenever the aforementioned maid grabbed hold of someone by the coat, sleeve, beard, or otherwise, she always seized money current and valid in this land; and she would quickly carry it to her mouth, chew it, and finally swallow it down, unless the people took it away from her beforehand; and likewise much of this still remains among the citizens here. But after such things had happened from her many times, it was reported to the honorable council, which had her taken into safe custody and care. But what wonders she performed would well deserve a special book to be written about them. She also seized 405 needles, which she chewed and also swallowed. In addition, she spoke good Upper German, which had previously been unknown to her; for she could speak nothing but her mother tongue, namely Markish, and even now can speak no differently. Therefore I was moved, as a preacher in that place at the time, to write to the reverend and highly learned Herr Doctor Martin Luther, according to this enclosed copy, and to ask him to share with me his counsel and good judgment in this matter. To which he replied to me: that it was a strange, unheard-of thing to him, if it were so; and therefore he requested that I write to him in my own hand the truth of it, whether it was indeed real money.

This I wrote back to him, that it was in no way otherwise. Thereupon he gave his recognition and shared with us his advice: that one should lead the maid into the sermon, and pray to God for her; so would it in time become better with her. In the meantime, she had been exorcised by a papist priest, in the hope of driving the devil out of her; over which she made much mockery, and scorned all such things. But when she was led into the sermon, the devil through her often accused me of lies during the preaching; and when I commanded him to be silent, she was silent, and thus she was helped through the common prayer; and I now know not what has happened to her, and what she has done, for to this day she is here a fresh and healthy serving maid. Which all is known and manifest not only in Frankfurt, but also in the whole Mark and many other places.

Somewhat later the following document appeared concerning her and her doings: Before all men in general and each one in particular, of whatever rank, estate, or condition they may be, who shall see, hear, or read this our public attestation, we, the judges and aldermen of the city of Frankfurt on the Oder, do hereby make known, by means of our friendly service in advance, that the worshipful Herr Erasmus Alberus, preacher at Küstrin, has earnestly requested of us, and sought from us a true testimony concerning the wondrous event which occurred here in Frankfurt about a year and a half ago with a maid, who by chance seized money with her hand and swallowed it, etc., as it pertains thereto. \[Page 269\]

We, the undersigned inhabitants, to attest to the truth and without hesitation in declaring it, provide this testimony: that the aforementioned wondrous event and miracle is here in Frankfurt well known, and publicly evident and widely rumored; that the said maiden, by mere chance, wherever she has touched with her hand---be it upon a coat, beret, doublet, hand, sleeve, head, beard, or upon a table, bench, wood, stone, earth, wall, or the like---has grasped therewith money in her hand, brought it to her mouth, and bitten into it so that it has cracked between her teeth; and she has let the coin protrude from her mouth, so that it could be clearly seen, and thereafter swallowed it, whereby she has often changed color in her face from a single swallow. Likewise, she has done this at night in bed while lying beside her nurse: from the featherbed, pillow, bedboard, and whatever else she has grasped, she has caught money, rustled with it, and stuffed her mouth full, so that she has horribly choked and gurgled from it, nearly suffocating, such that a light had to be kindled and aid brought to her, leaving her neck immediately bruised and blackened.

People have also at first, whenever she has grasped at some object, swiftly seized her hand before she could bring it to her mouth, and by force pried open her hand to take the money from it, whereupon she has screamed horribly. She has also handed over the money from her own self to certain honorable folk, both men and women, after making such a grasp; and at times she has stuffed her entire mouth full of money with her hand, rustled it about in her mouth, and gnashed it with her teeth. And it has been all manner of valid coinage, such as Markish groschen, pfennigs, Stettin, Meissen, Polish, and Bohemian money, as well as Prussian groschen; and among them some bad, reddish coin as well. Otherwise, when questioned, she has spoken strange and wondrous words. All this, as reported above---and much else besides---through grasping at money, she has done to herself.

In truth, it happened just as described, as many people, including council members, are still present who have the money that they received from her. To confirm the truth of this, I, Theobald Dürrekragen, the honorable and wise council's appointed and established judge at the court in Frankfurt an der Oder, have knowingly had the court's seal affixed to this letter by the assessors. Given on Saturday after the Nativity of St. Anne, 1585.

One sees that much is still missing for this remarkable appearance to be fully investigated and recorded in all its circumstances. Only one thing must be regarded as firmly established---since one cannot assume that the people were foolish enough to let themselves be deceived by sleight of hand---that is, the money-grabbing and the swallowing of what was grabbed. Georg Sabinus, who in the fourth book of his Latin elegies dedicated a special one to it, has added some decisive circumstances therein. A voice called out to her in her sleep: "Arise, great riches will be given to you!" She awakens and sees, not far from her bed, a distinguished man who says to her: "If you will be my beloved, then you shall enjoy all my treasures that lie hidden in the earth." She is said to have replied: "Whoever you may be, you shall be mine." Now the apparition suddenly takes on a different, terrible form; the girl is frightened by it and by the glow of its eyes, and becomes enraged. Chained up, the raving one says: she will bring the treasures from the earth's bosom to the light of day; and now holds out money and silver to the guards, which, if they do not wrest it from her, she buries in her entrails. \[Page 270\]

This lust, however, reveals itself as greed, which in its deepest vital root is already a kind of wolf's hunger for gold; which, here demonized through consent, gives itself to be known physiologically through the attraction of the hot-hungrily delighted one. But this attraction is, in pull and counter-pull, mutual, and already in the commonly occurring greed, when it cuts deeply, a certain mutual tenderness can be noticed between the lover and the beloved metal; so that the latter seems to gather around him as if instinctively. Here, in the heightened state, the dark inclination becomes a clear striving, the money gathers around her like iron filings around the poles of the magnet; but she, intoxicated by it to frenzy, and hungering and thirsting for it with haste, does not hide it like the others in chests and boxes; but swallows it down in hot hunger, in order to preserve it in her entrails in the closest proximity. In all these appearances, a Sabbath of the inanimate nature has gathered around the life; a mirror image of that other one, in which life itself unites around its self-chosen, false center. To bind such a mirror Sabbath enduringly to the person requires a powerful natural instinct in her: greed and the desire to eat, which may become tools of a deeply incising temptation; and when these now approach, demand consent; just as it was also the case with the other drive that lies at the base of this its spectrum. If this assent does not follow, as was the case with Marie von Mörl, who moreover built a wall around herself through obedience; then the gathering disperses soon.

But if the will yields itself to the tempter, and is even accepted as a paramour, as was the case with the fisherwoman; then the metals come, drawn by a magnetic attraction, and set out on the bridal journey, in order to serve as bride pennies at the wedding. The meal of needles, nails, shards, which the master offers to his own, is however only a meal of trial for the neophytes; for the initiates, as we have seen, a higher and more spiritual food is prepared, which rises gradually from carrion and refuse and human flesh, or that from unclean and uneatable animals, up to the highest and best, but only in the remoteness of a shadow, and quenches no thirst and stills no hunger. For the food of the demon has not sprung forth from life and ripened in the light; it has grown forth from death, and the night has nurtured it, and steeped it in poison.

But what has taken its origin from death cannot, in entering into life, be life-promoting; rather it sows in it the seed of the same perdition in which it itself is prepared. Therefore it can also satisfy no hunger, and quench no burning of thirst, and thereby bring forth any enjoyment of life; for there is no gentle, refreshing coolness or nourishing power in it. Rather a scorching fire is hidden in it, which never gives, but always only taking, increases the hunger and thirst in proportion as it is offered to them for satisfaction. But the root of death is a bitter root, and what has sprung up from this is steeped through and through with bitterness by it; whereas only from life can sweetness flow forth. Therefore this food, unlike the pure, loving nourishment of the transfigured ones, is coarse and refractory, and fills the mouth with bitterness; in opposition to that sweetness, of which the saints have so much to tell. \[Page 271\]

The wine also is made equal to this nourishment; it is not unlocked from the sun-ripened sweetness, through the incubation of mild warmth, into a heart-gladdening drink; rather the subterranean, unbound fire has torn apart the bitterness congealed in the shadow; and thus everything is fermented into that drink which kindles a heavy, turbid, wildly raging intoxication in the veins of the drinker. And just because all fare here is from death, and returns again to death; therefore the guests must also prove themselves therein as the army of death, in that at these Thyestean banquets, like the all-devourer, they must mutually devour one another: because, while life, from generation to generation, spreads itself ever richer; death forms a backward-going, ever more constricting current. And thus the idea underlying all these visions is this: the demon, as the apparent feeder, is in truth the insatiably hungering eater; and he cheats his guests of the life which he assumes the appearance of promoting.

##### iii. The Connections to the Animal Kingdom

The directions of the appetite become monstrous, and go, on the paths just pursued, into inorganic nature; and the substances belonging to it follow the attraction which the connections have tied, up to the hearth in the corresponding organ from which they take their origin. But these appetites are also directed into the living creation, and when they are inflamed to monstrosity, they also enter into an exchange with it; which, through its measureless, grotesque exaggeration, has a hellish character. The transition into this realm is made by that kind of visions in which the evil clothes itself in the form of an animal; and sets itself in a definite relation to the life-circle of the obsessed one. There especially in the English witchcraft the peculiarity comes to the fore: that in the interrogations there it is frequently spoken of the so-called imps, in the retinue of the witches; which appear in the form of birds, moles, and the like. \[Page 272\]

Always in their vicinity they are, and evidently, like the toads in the south, they have come to them from the herd of the Sabbath. It is now remarkable in this regard that the interrogated persons nearly unanimously know how to recount the sucking to which they must submit for these their companions. Elizabeth Style of Stoketrister, in the county of Somerset, confessed voluntarily without torture, in the year 1664 before Judge Hunt: her spirit, to whom she had devoted herself, had frequently appeared to her in the form of a butterfly; and, according to the contract she had concluded with him, had sucked her every morning at four o'clock in the early hours on the whirl of her head; and it had almost hurt her when she thus had to let herself be sucked.

Alice Dicke of Wincanton confesses: how she too had had a familiar spirit that sucked her breast, commonly in the evenings, on the side; while Christina Green of Brewham reports: how she no less had consented to let herself be sucked once every 24 hours; and how the spirit now every morning, in the form of a stingless hedgehog, fulfilled the contract. She adds: how this sucking caused her no small pain, and how she commonly found herself in a state of ecstasy when she was being sucked.

The connection of this appearance with the previous one is not easy to overlook. As the nerve-exhausted, sick life sucks on the healthy one to fill its own emptiness from it; so it seems also to be the case with the life-spirits from the left side: which, although immortal, yet in life impoverished, needy as they are, seek to supplement their lack from elsewhere. The means for this the human being will now provide, who has what they must lack. But it cannot be stolen, that over which he disposes as his endowment in being; if, however, it succeeds in deceiving the possessor out of his consent, then the overlusters dispose as they please over what has been ceded to them. The death-frost now warms itself at the warm life; and what happens in the root from force to force, that mirrors itself in the bodily, onto which it transfers itself from within outward. Because now the life is in the blood, the yearning for life will make itself known as a blood-sucking; and the spirit becomes a vampire, who in manifold forms, at determined critical times regulated by the movements of life, comes to take blood; but not, like the Redeemer, to revive the perishing life anew. But in a demonic ecstasy this act is accomplished: it is thus no outer, but an inner one, directed against the life, and not immediately against its sheath, which is only drawn into the action through participation.

The reverse side of this sequence of appearances emerges there where the reports, from the ecstatically become bodily nature, go directly into the actual animal kingdom, and now the relation that in ordinary life exists between the organism and the intestinal worms is extended in a magical manner also to other animal classes. The most instructive thing that has occurred in this way is what at the end of the sixteenth century took place in the Upper Palatinate. On 20 November 1694, the twelve-year-old son Theodor of the pastor Z. Döderlin there, at the church of Berolzheim near Weissenburg am Sand, had begun to complain of headache and stomach ache, with complete loss of appetite; but the mother, who believed he had perhaps eaten something harmful while playing in the garden, had given him a home remedy, which however on the following day had only produced vomiting and stool, with the expulsion of some worms.

It took another six days of all sorts of remedies to still the vomiting; but since fainting fits, heart palpitations, and epileptic convulsions followed, they called in the physician from Weissenburg, Dr. Wider, for counsel; who advised on worms, and prescribed helminthogogic remedies, mixed with stomach-strengthening and anti-epileptic ones. These too were applied fruitlessly for a whole month, and the symptoms of the illness multiplied; they therefore discontinued the medicines, and resorted only to a bloodletting, after which the patient's strength increased somewhat, and only the vomiting persisted. Wider therefore prescribed, on the 5th of January 1695, pills against it once more, as well as against the worms; whereupon the boy for the first time began to feel a large worm in his intestines, and on the 2nd became so deranged that it seemed his end was at hand. But when he came to himself again, he filled the house with weeping and lamenting, threw himself from the bed onto a bench, and rolled about on it, continually crying out that the worm would kill him with its bites. They gave him all manner of things, especially garlic juice, after which the worm ceased biting, and the boy stopped his wailing. The doctor prescribed what was fitting, but the worm proceeded once more to bite, now on the right side, now on the left; and the boy rolled about screaming again, and the pain nearly drove him to madness. \[Page 273\]

This continued for so long, until someone advised soothing the creature with milk; it then indeed desisted from biting, but was by no means thereby expelled. They immediately administered suitable medicines, of which, however, only the Marrubium album drove a millipede out through the stool. Since the tartar emetic weakened the boy immensely, he was conveyed under medical care to Weissenburg, where quicksilver and the decoction of Hypericum procured him three days of rest; but upon that the worm, ascending as far as the pit of the stomach, began once more to stir most violently. Only by means of milk could it be pacified; with bitter drinks it bit furiously about. Abstinence from food and drink brought on labored breathing, swelling of the face, and choking fits. They administered such violent purgatives that it seemed either the boy or the worm must succumb to them; all to no avail. They were therefore obliged to resolve on sending him back again to his parents. In the meantime, someone had made the proposal to the despairing ones, to assist the patient against the worm with warm cloths, and this proved effective: they could drive it or lure it backwards or forwards with them; it came sometimes as far as the gullet, and had to be repelled with vinegar.

From that time onward the boy could retain the foods that pleased the creature; the others, however, it cast back from the gullet. They obtained the judgment of the medical faculty at Altdorf; who, since medicines would not avail, proposed a dissection to be performed by a skilled hand; and since this did not seem agreeable, the most renowned physicians in Nuremberg, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Oettingen, and Switzerland were consulted, but their counsel remained wholly without effect. Full three hundred times a day the worm ascended into the throat; the belly meanwhile swelled enormously from sundry creatures, which from time to time could be felt externally; but these always remained below, while that one alone mounted upward. They placed the boy on his head, and had him inhale the vapor of milk. The worm, following after the milk, came up so far that it became visible to those standing by, but could nevertheless never be drawn forth; only another millipede was expelled. Only before the Marrubium album did the creature show aversion; its decoction always drove it from the stomach into the intestines, under great pains to the boy; which pains endured until it had reached the lowest bowels. But when it was just on the point of being expelled from there, it suddenly mounted back up to the stomach, and celebrated its happy return with some merry leaps. \[Page 274\]

It was equally sensitive to heat; a burning wax candle, the flame from the stove, the rubbing with warm cloths drove it to flight; and it immediately rolled itself into a lump, in which one could feel a movement like that of vipers. If one brought an even hotter cloth near, it fled to another corner. When the abdomen swelled, which happened several times daily, then the strongest man could not press it down; but as soon as someone pressed the head of the worm with a finger, the others, all of them smaller, fled to another place. Rue was so hateful to them that, if the boy smelled it, ate it, or laid it on the abdomen, they were all thrown into great rage and agitation. They likewise abhorred radish, vinegar, and everything bitter; but the sweet was exceedingly pleasant to them, and the scent of a musk ball made the larger worm leap up perhaps a hundred times in a quarter of an hour. From then on, however, he abated somewhat in his wildness; for although he climbed up into the throat more than a thousand times every day, and each time had to be removed by swallowing, whereby the noise he made could be heard a hundred paces away; yet he bit only when provoked to anger, and then only lightly.

Now one of those folk healers appeared, of the kind that the faculty is wont to call medicaster, who advised removing the bitter, but recommended sweet and fatty things. His advice was followed, and whether it was due to the application of these remedies or to chance, from March 4 to 26 the following creatures emerged from the boy's mouth and anus, to the astonishment of all witnesses. Namely: 162 larger and smaller centipedes, ten or twenty at a time; two moths; a white worm with a black head, while a similar one bored into the navel; four fast-running worms, each with twenty stinger-bearing feet; four hopping butterflies; four other swiftly moving red maggots resembling large ants; a white centipede; 42 dark-colored caterpillars of various sizes; finally, a full-grown beetle. Not all emerged through the mouth, but some crawled along the palate to the ethmoid bone, and were then driven out through the nose with a warm cloth. They were all very lively and so nimble that, if one did not catch them immediately, they soon ran away. They did not come mixed together, but the like kinds appeared together; the smaller insects were surrounded by the four larger ones, and by some smaller earthworms, as if by a dam; and some of them lived 3, 8, up to 12 days, until they finally starved to death.

The parents joyfully considered the boy already freed; but on March 26 an interlude occurred that led them to conclude it was sorcery. As the other children were playing in the garden on March 26, they found in a new bird's nest a white bird's egg painted with red figures; but when they opened it to eat, the yolk was black and sprinkled as if with gunpowder. For this reason they threw it against the fence and washed their hands; but as the parents and neighbors now came running up because of the novelty of the thing, suddenly a rooster fell down dead; two hens, however, were seized with convulsions, and on the following day the crossroads in the garden was found sprinkled with a black powder. That incompetent doctor now had the boy's abdomen covered with plasters, gave him all sorts of things unceasingly, and had the belly bound and pressed upward. Now, from that day until the end of May, four frogs of medium size were driven out from the boy's mouth, by applying stinking things from below but sweet ones from above; one of which had a beetle, a mealworm, and a frog in its stomach, the second slime, but the other two nothing in their stomachs. When the first one had been expelled, some friends advised: to bring the boy at night to the fish pond, where there were many frogs; in the hope that, if he still had more inside him, these might perhaps be lured out by sympathy with those in the pond. \[Page 275\]

Scarcely had he, however, come near the pond, when his belly swelled beyond measure. The worm, which for several weeks had not bitten, now began again its old cruel game, and rose up in the following days perhaps a thousand times; but the frogs in the boy's body answered those outside with the same croaking and the same motion; so that, on account of the uproar in his body, the boy from then on never again dared to go out at the time when the frogs croaked. After the expulsion of the frogs followed some toads, then 21 lizards of various sizes; the frogs as well as the toads were lively in color, and of different kinds. The larger span-long toad killed the smaller one at once with her breath, and filled perhaps a glass with her slime, which she then swallowed up again. Before the separation of all these animals went a feverish chill, followed by a tickling in the throat. Then the animals were vomited up lengthwise, without particular pain.

The last lizard was covered with a piece of skin from another dead one. It was now believed that the great worm too had in some way departed. But when the boy, after his daily prayer, went to bed again, which he had shunned for two days out of fear, and now fell asleep easily; he suddenly raised himself up, and cried: something bitter had flowed into his throat, from which his lower belly was swelling; at the same time the worm began to rage again. Since the insect nest was now destroyed, it ran up and down freely and as if in a fury, and bit most violently at the slightest movement of the boy. Whether it had been vomited up and returned, or had remained, had to remain undecided.

But when on the 9th of June friends who visited the boy brought him confections, the creature was thereby lured several times into his throat; and caused him such distress that he lay down on a cushion of the bench by the window in the sun; and there, holding a piece of confection in his hand, he became a little beside himself. The creature, lured by the sweetness, now sprang forth; to those present it seemed a viper, and the boy's body fell together at once. The housemates searched most eagerly for the viper in all corners for a whole hour, but could not find it. So that it might not slip into the boy's mouth again, it was resolved to convey him over to the house of a trusted neighbor; where he remained for eight days sound and cheerful. Meanwhile, some remedies were provided to the boy by a respectable person, which were supposed to be particularly salutary against sorcery: a water, a powder for fumigating, another with an oil to rinse the mouth, and an amulet. At the same time the remedies of the unqualified doctor were continued, and now the boy vomited up, from the 17th to the 21st of June, some shoe nails, half of a chain ring, seven pieces of bowls, stones among which two quite large ones, a ball of hair, pieces of white and red eggshells, two forks one of which was wound around with hair, a piece of a medicine glass, finally two large nails.

At all these things, as at the departure of the animals, were present the collector Knebel, the pastor of Trommetsheim, and many other most credible people. All the objects came singly, under sometimes hours-long exertions; which at the forks were so great that they produced an exceedingly strong hoarseness. The boy now felt nothing more, and the parents resolved to take him home again; but they placed him in another room, and he slept with a relative who watched over him the whole night until six o'clock in the morning. \[Page 276\]

Shortly after she had fallen asleep, the viper returned, however, to the horror of all. Since they applied triple doses of the medicine and manifold prayers, she soon departed again in that light ecstasy which overtakes the severely exhausted; after she had previously bitten his foot, so that he came to from it, and ran screaming into the father's study, showing the swollen foot and calling for help. Some theriac and the anointing with scorpion oil soon restored him, so that his parents took him to church on Sunday. But as he was on the stairs, from the lower story to the upper, the viper pursued him again; so that he hurriedly slammed the door of the upper hallway behind him and cried for help. Trembling as he was, he therefore could not be let out of sight the entire day; during which he then, in the evening, expelled one of the forks from himself. He spent the night in the house of C. Bambrucker, under the watch of his grandmother and constant prayer, peacefully. But early in the morning at 6 o'clock, he felt the viper in his body again, and one could plainly hear it hissing.

He was therefore brought home once more; the grandmother, who constantly remained at his bedside, did not take her eyes off him, in case she might see the creature at its exit. In vain, however---as soon as sleep and that kind of ecstasy came over the boy, it had gone out for the fourth time, and bit him so fiercely in the hand that the blood began to flow from it. The parents now sent the boy, under the care of his grandmother, to Weissenburg, and there he continued the use of the medicines under good care. He still vomited some smaller frogs, and three pieces of a smaller viper, such as the son of the apothecary Höchstetter had found him lying on the ground and picked up; but now, after some tufts of hair had passed from him in Rotenburg in July 1695, he became completely healthy in body and soul, and at the time of the report's composition lived at the Gymnasium in Heilbronn, devoted to his studies.

In this story, palpable bestiality and mystical superstition border so closely upon one another in an animal fable that a rational age could neither withhold nor grant belief, and thus strove most eagerly to dispose of the whole matter as quickly as possible through forgetting, in which it succeeded quite well. Since we cannot do the many sensible people who had dealings with the story the indignity of believing that they let themselves be fooled for longer than six months by a cunning boy; we must therefore look elsewhere to connect the event with other things heard, and thereby make it somewhat comprehensible to ourselves. \[Page 277\]

On the occasion of the viper, we learn that the boy, in all the acts where it actively intervenes and seems to come and go, was in a kind of ecstatic sleep. We must assume that this was already an innate disposition in him, and that the entry of all the animals that made their home in him had already occurred in a seizure of this ecstasy. In the garden or nearby there was a fish pond, in and around which all these animals were to be found; the boy had played near it the day before the outbreak of the affliction, and had likely fallen into that sleep-waking state at its edge. All those rapports that sleep even in life itself had now awakened in him, and begun their play. Just as the underground metals enter the circle of the rhodomancer, the movements of the stars into the sphere of the star-sick, the dead into that of the vampirically afflicted; so it was here with the animals, within the sphere of action of these instincts: they were not merely perceived, but felt their pull on their own side as well, and yielded to it. This showed itself still, after the counter-act of the intake, in the act of their expulsion.

All the animals, namely, as soon as they had come to light through vomiting, ran about with great agility; fleeing every other human being except the boy, toward whom they felt a secret sympathy; and he could lure them wherever he wished, touch them if he pleased, and, to preserve them, lock them up in a vessel, in which they lived for a time nourished with milk, but then, when sprinkled with horse urine, died. Drawn by this secret sympathy, the animals at that time---whether in pairs, or merely fertilized female individuals---had entered through the boy's open mouth, just as all sexes had then entered the saving ark; they had settled in his interior, and in the same instincts gained a right of home in the domain of their lord and king: a right that was first canceled for them only when the sympathy, through the medicines and the reactions of nature, had turned into antipathy. They were now expelled, especially in the reversal of the peristaltic movement; and the sequence in which they had gone out in masses, grouped according to species, shows the sequence in which they had built their nests inside from above downward. \[Page 278\]

The first to have come were the lizards, those nimble, agile creatures that easily slip into any opening; they had therefore settled deepest in the lower entrails, and there multiplied fruitfully. The toads and the frogs had joined them, and taken up residence in the next higher regions of the entrails. These had been followed by the earthworms; a beetle that had remained infertile, and the host of caterpillars had spread through the thin intestines, and two of them had already completed their metamorphosis. Finally, nearest the lower gate of the stomach, the last to arrive---and therefore also the first to be expelled---centipedes had found their lodging. In proportion as the settlers had multiplied, the boy's abdomen had swollen; but the animals themselves in their lightless abode had become equally distended, like the plants that by chance had grown up in the night of the mines. It was observed of all of them that they were of unusual size, and had fat bellies; but if they were dead, they quickly collapsed, and shriveled away into insignificant remnants. The animal heat had slowly promoted them, but their cold-blooded nature had given them that irritability toward higher degrees of heat. Also remarkable are the other observations made on this occasion concerning their household: their aversion to horehound, rue, beet, St. John's wort, all things bitter and sour; their love for milk and all things sweet, and for the pleasant scent of musk; remarkable too that, hearing through all the belly coverings, they had been collectively excited by the frogs in the pond, and even the enclosed ones had begun to cry out.

The innate head of the animal sabbath, which the boy had abidingly assembled in his entrails, was that viper who had pitched her court in the stomach, from there ruled the upper parts, and, when she wished, stretched her snakelike body through the realms and nests of the lower animals. Her dominion showed itself when her head was roughly touched; at which all the animals took flight before her wrath and the convulsive movements of her body. One might doubt her existence, and believe that she owed her being only to the ecstatic vision of the intestine filled with that parasitic life, which would now have to project itself snakelike into the inner sense; had she not been felt all too clearly at that time, upon the application of heat, in that tangle, and otherwise; and had not actual parts belonging to a snakelike body been later discharged.

However, there was always a connection between her and the ecstatic state of the boy, which confused in her the realms of the tangible and the visionary, and particularly made uncertain the reports concerning her exit and entrance. For she was never seen and found by anyone with clarity, although she was sought everywhere with the utmost care; for which reason a doubt was also entertained regarding her actual existence, since she never appeared without a slight state of being beside himself on the part of the boy, who thereafter could never quite remember what had happened to him. Only once did one believe to have seen her, as she slipped out with her larger half from the mouth of the boy, and, startled only by the outcry of those standing around, went back. Entrance and exit were always accompanied by a bitter-gall taste in the boy's mouth; which proved her close connection with her domain, the liver system. As it appears, she met her death shortly before the end of the illness, and the expelled fragments belonged to her. The departed inorganic objects seem to attach themselves to a later form of the illness; but little weight can be given to the point of incidence with the found egg, since it stands only episodically without further connection to the object.

#### B. The Reproductive Drive and the Blood-Lust as Points of Attachment for Demonic Rapports

\[Page 279\]

All external reproduction is, from the organic side, a self-reproduction that steps outward, continuing itself in another individual. The two causes of life, the active and the passive, which in the latter of these work united in the same personality, divide themselves in the other between the two sexes; and thus these, alongside the self-reproduction that each practices inwardly for itself, also encounter one another externally for a third reproduction; in the continuation and connection of the fundamental acts into a third act, and in the union of the two self-reproduced, a third-reproduced comes forth, in which each claims its share. For the orderly, natural, and fruitful reproduction, therefore, it is required that not only the two self-reproductions, in their powers and organs, proceed in living sufficiency; but that beyond this, enough of life remain over, so as likewise, in its separate powers and organs, to step forth organically, to accomplish the third act, with corresponding energy of power, in the fullness of the material; so that thus, for the reception of the spiritual, the third life may ignite itself in the appropriate corporeality.

For this, the sexes are now placed in a special rapport to one another, in which they meet and unite themselves for the work. But as the process of self-reproduction on both sides, toward the outside, is connected with an assimilation process, through which the corporeality, from natural substances and in natural powers, produces and births itself again and again anew and yet the same, and thus maintains itself in enduring existence; so will it also be arranged around the third reproduction in the midst of the two. The life-germ that has arisen in the interaction of both sexes appropriates to itself from the maternal organism what is agreeable to it; and when it has thereby attained a certain degree of development, it steps forth into the daylight, in order as an independent organism to practice the same appropriation against the external nature.

So, in that every succeeding generation has always proceeded through procreation from the preceding one, and through appropriation has taken up into itself the beginnings of corporeality; the first-created life-germ of the entire race, ever creating out of nature and giving back to it, has spread itself more and more within it; and in that the drop, which was hewn down from on high, has in this way gradually grown into a broad and full stream; the continuance of the entire race, bound together through all times, finds itself secured, through this never-stagnating process of appropriation, in the midst of physical nature; while its spiritual \[aspect\] is preserved in the continuing activation of the souls created potentially in the original beginning.

What, therefore, on the path of nature, has founded this bodily-earthly existence of humanity, that had to happen once more in the realm of grace, in order to secure and restore that spiritual-super-earthly \[existence\] as well. The work of redemption has founded this securing and restoration; and since then we see, in the midst of the race, upon the natural organism and the natural process active within it---which Christianity presupposes both as given---a churchly organism planted, and within this an unremittingly active, much-divided act of grace, through which it too, remaining in the midst of change and unchangeably the same, maintains itself. For through the Incarnation a new life-germ has namely been founded in the midst of spiritually sickened humanity; and proceeding from it, that great process of grace, encompassing all times, has now immediately begun. This higher process is also, like the natural one, divided into two parts; it begins with a spiritual begetting, just as the other with a natural one, and continues in the same way into an unceasing appropriation. \[Page 280\]

But for both acts, the Redeemer now stands, in his God-united humanity, in relation to the entire race as the active cause to the passive \[recipient\]; because before his higher supernatural unity the sexual opposition entirely disappears. For as both sexes, equally needy of the higher impregnation through grace, enter into the same relation to him; the Church, to which they are united, appears as his bride; and as she is united with him in orderly spiritual marriage, he stands as her head and husband, she as the domina opposite the Dominus. He, now, from the beginning and from then on through the course of time, has begotten in himself the life reborn in him, and himself in him, in the circle of churchly vitality; but she, and in her all who belong to her, have received, and cooperating in his effect have brought forth the received \[life\] outwardly. But the bringing forth has also occurred through a process of assimilation; in that he, the one begetting himself, as appropriating life-germ active within her, first from her, and then everything that is outside, viewing as appropriable nature, has truly appropriated it to himself and continues to appropriate; and so it has come to pass that, as here too from one many have become, a new reborn human race has proceeded forth in the midst of the old.

Beside this Church and her head, however, there now arises her counterpart, the counter-church, likewise united under her head. For as all good in human nature stands in a rapport of consonance, sympathy, and love to its first giver and later restorer, through which precisely that higher life-germ gains entry for implantation, and then, nourishing and thriving in that which is turned toward it, comes to development; so the evil in it is inclined to its first originator and disseminator, and connected with him in an equal rapport, strives to take him into itself and itself into him, so that he may embody himself in its material.

The demon thus stands in the same relation to this dark nature in man as the Savior stands to the light and better one; and just as the latter, begetting life in it, assimilates it to life, so the former, since he has no true life in himself, can only beget what he possesses, namely death, and can only appropriate to the given seed of death what is sickly and dead. He can therefore also form nothing organic for himself with it, determine himself in harmony, shape himself, precisely because dissonance and contradiction form his peculiar essence; he thus requires for his semblance-formations a true formation, so that he may implant death into his life, and the formless, cadaverous deformity into his maintained form. His counter-church thus requires the church, so that it may come to appearance in it, if not through it, through the dark, as sickness does in healthy life. \[Page 281\]

Bound to this darkness in rapport, he now begets the seed of death in it; and the implanted one now becomes the striking point, around which in the in and out all appropriation of the like occurs. Here too, therefore, in the realm of life there exists a sexual relation between the demon and those who mark themselves with his sign. But because before him, the creaturely spirit, the sexual opposition of the creature does not vanish; therefore he also does not stand to it, as does the head of the church, in the unconditional relation of the active to the passive cause; but the active becomes passive to him, the passive active in opposition. Upon this relation, therefore, a marriage will also ground itself in the realm of life; but this marriage is a wild marriage, the counter-church is connected to its lord as a concubine, not as a mistress, but as a maid to her tyrant; and it is not the blessing of that chaste begetting, as it rests upon the union of heaven and earth; but the curse of whoredom, as it lay upon the service of the Baals, which shrank from no abomination and had no scruple about proceeding even against nature. Therefore, however, this union can never be fruitful; pregnant with ruin, it gives birth to destruction, because all negation only takes, but can never give anything.

What in this way, in the two churches, valid for all, inwardly veiled in hiddenness, and yet felt by all, outwardly entered into life, that shows itself in the twofold mysticism, now more withdrawn from externality, but inwardly for that reason unveiled. For with all other drives and powers, the sexual drive has also turned inward, and intensified itself in its exponent. Toward the good side, this intensification is connected with a withdrawal from the animal, and an inner purification; so that, just as there in the inner self-begetting the life and the corporeality allotted to it are transfigured, so too the same life, in its inbirth into the mystical body of the church, gives birth only to what is good and transfigured from its head. But in the dark nature, this apparent intensification is directed toward the abyss, in truth a deepening through the animal beneath nature, from which only the distorted and prodigious emerges. The life that dwells in the sexual organs, unbound from its bearer, and now centering and gathering itself in itself, can now, having become receptive to spiritual touches, there form rapports from which relations of the most brutal kind develop; to which the outer reality has indeed faded, but which for that are compensated by a very definite inner one. We have spoken of them in their generality earlier already on the occasion of the Sabbath; it remains for us here only to consider them in their particularity, insofar as they, proceeding from an individuality, strive to raise themselves to that generality.

They now seek, in the guise of the act of generation, to unite disparate realms; and now there arises, as either the demonic life actively causes in the passionate human, or this takes the active role while that assumes the passive one, the Incubus and the Succubus as a modality of the drive thus demonizing itself, which can again spread in an epidemic and contagious manner. Or the relations thus attached by it seek hostilely to force themselves into the natural act of generation, and to paralyze and thwart the natural act; and thus the relations manifest themselves in a destructive way in the tying of the navel-cord and in everything connected with it.

##### i. The Incubus and the Succubus.

\[Page 282\]

The natural phenomenon that forms the basis here, and the predisposition, is the Alp, which we have already considered earlier. It is twofold: a pressing, anxiety-inducing, binding, paralyzing kind, and another elastic, expansive, loosening, stimulating kind: the former, proceeding from the solar plexus, inhibiting and restricting the nervous activity; the latter, from there into the sexual organs, as the other focal point, driving, exciting, and determining this activity to increased vigor. These are the beginnings of the evil, as all natural adiaphoric nature, and as all disease, arising from a power foreign to life, confusing and clouding it. The evil can intensify, the inner disharmony can become so confused that, in the counteraction, a deep sleep arises that has these organs as its center. Then a hysterical somnambulism emerges, proceeding from this center, in which what appears confused, darkened, and disordered in the ordinary Alp takes on definite forms, and already betrays traces of the proximity of spiritual powers. It will not yet appear altogether necessary that such a state must be of a demonic nature; but the danger lies close that it may pass over into one.

For life is now polarized over to this side, it points over into the spiritual realms; relations valid there have become unbound in it, and it now seeks in them that with which it may satiate itself. If it now, when the drive has turned to the demonic side, finds a place where the feelers that have emerged from it can attach themselves; then it strikes them in there, sucks itself fast, and now becomes at home in this realm, and forms a continuum with its center. The demonization of the drive thus intensified has then proceeded from its own assent, and the partial obsession is its own deed. Or the nature prepared through inner division is merely taken possession of by the foreign power; whether this throws itself upon it, or whether it is determined to do so through the influence of another; then it is possession, which is a demonic illness, and cannot be imputed in the absence of the will's assent.

Among the numerous facts that present themselves, we shall select only those that either lie at the transition into the demonic character, or appear fully expressed in it. The first was around the middle of the seventeenth century the case with a poor widow in Bergamo, of whom the exorcist Brognoli tells: when she was alone in her bedroom, she was always afflicted by the speaking of many voices. Some said: Let us sleep with her! Others replied to that: She will not consent, for she fears God! whereupon others again interjected: She will indeed consent, and if she will not, then we need only use force! It then seemed to her as if one ascended her bed, and so she lay seized by the greatest fear, and no sleep came into her eyes. :) That was the indecision, and the struggle; the approach of the evil and its repulsion through the resolve of the will. If this resolve remains firm and well-grounded, then the approaching demonium can do nothing against it, and help will then come easily. \[Page 283\]

Thus it was with those of whom Coleti¹ tells. A woman of his parish came to him with her husband. She was pious and of good morals, but for ten years she had been plagued by such a spirit who suggested shameful things to her, and day and night, even when she was not asleep, behaved as an Incubus toward her, so that what she suffered was by no means a dream. But with regard to her consent, she could not be won over, and she remained unshaken. The Exorcist did nothing but pronounce the mild precept against the demon, and from then on she had peace from him. Another woman of his acquaintance had likewise been tempted for eight years by such a one; the woman had actual, real dealings with him; but she too had not consented, but rather abhorred the mischief, and so she too was freed by a simple command to him.

But if there is pleasure in the act, then the evil takes deeper root. In the year 1643, Brognoli recounts, I traveled, on the command of my superiors, to a place to free a twenty-year-old girl who was plagued by an Incubus, and went with her confessor to her dwelling. Scarcely had we entered the house when the demon, who was just in the midst of it, immediately ceased. I now spoke to her, and she laid out for me clearly and distinctly everything that the demon was accustomed to do with her. From this report I soon understood: that she, although she denied it, had nevertheless given the demon an indirect consent. For when she felt his nearness, through the swelling of the affected parts and the violent titillation, then she did not take refuge in prayer; she did not call upon God and the Virgin for help, nor upon the angel of her chastity; but instead she hurried to her chamber and lay down in bed, so that thus the Evil One could more conveniently and pleasantly perform his business. When I therefore sought to awaken in her the act of firm trust in God for her deliverance, she remained dry and without any emotion; indeed, she felt in her heart continually a contradiction, that she should not be freed. I therefore left her, after first leaving some instructions to her confessor and her elders, on penance and on subduing her body through fasting and mortifications.

But this consent is most easily obtained when the approaching evil takes the form of a beloved object. In Bergamo, in the year 1650, a young merchant, about twenty years old, was plagued by a Succubus, as the same Brognoli³ told him: several months before, as he lay in bed in his chamber, the demon had appeared to him in the form of an exceedingly beautiful girl whom he loved. When he, seeing this form, had cried out, she had immediately commanded him to be silent, assuring him: she was that girl, and had fled from the house because her mother had mistreated her with blows; and now she came to see her beloved. He himself knew very well that it was not his Theresa, but some house-demon; nevertheless, after some words and embraces, he took it into his bed. After that the form said to him: she was not the girl, but a demon who loved him, and therefore joined herself to him day and night. So it lasted for several months, until God freed him through my intervention, and he did penance for his sins. \[Page 284\]

But if consent has occurred, it reveals itself easily through the ensuing familiarity. The same Exorcist was told by a woman in 1694: every night the Incubus lay with her, practiced all sorts of unchastities with her, led her to blaspheme God, and to talk and chat with him as with her husband. Moreover, she was often led out of the house to practice the same with other sorcerers.

One sees how here already the evil has risen from the lower regions into the higher ones, there calling forth blasphemies, and then turning into the vision of the Sabbath. Just as clearly does this agreement reveal itself through external signs and the boldness of the behavior. In the year 1649, Brognoli recounts, I was to exorcise a possessed woman on the order of the Apostolic Nuncio; she visited me the following day at the door of the monastery of St. Bonaventure, dressed in the habit of a Tertiary of St. Francis, but very vainly adorned, quite beautiful and about 35 years old. When I asked her: What sort of torment the demon was inflicting upon her? she replied: It has been about 18 years since he, in the form of a handsome youth, has abused my body; which happened, as now, so also during the lifetime of my husband, when he would then send a sleep over him and do as he pleased. In the conversations that I have with him, he always drives me to blasphemy; he also often brings me out of the house at night to consort with other sorcerers.

I now began to exorcise her in her house; but soon noticed that she was in complete agreement with the demon. For she brought me a message from his side: if I wished to free the woman from him, I must proceed according to the ancient *Rituale Romanum* and according to the *Flagellum Daemonum* of Menghi. I must first inquire of him the signs of the maleficium, which were laid in a human skull; and moreover procure for myself the fish gall with which the young Tobias drove the demon out of his wife. The intention to trick him with this was all too obvious; he therefore replied: he had no need at all to let himself be instructed by the devil on how to drive him out of believing and God-fearing men and women. She should therefore tell him: he, being a spirit and easily traversing all seas, should search out that fish in them and bring it to the fish market in Venice for sale. I would then, if it seemed right and fitting to me, take the liver and do with it what seemed appropriate according to Catholic custom.

The cunning woman fell silent with a smile and only begged me to visit her again when she summoned me; and I left her with good admonitions to repentance and to the use of spiritual means to free herself from the power to which she belonged body and soul. Since she in the meantime had me summoned a second time to the house of a painter where she lived, the painter's maid, a pious and God-fearing woman, warned me against her: she was a sorceress who went out of the house half-naked and nude. When I therefore entered her room, I asked her: whether she had followed my admonitions? She answered: the demon had resisted and not wanted her to follow them. From which it was clear to recognize: that she had sought me out not to be freed from the demon, but to draw me into perdition. But she had deceived herself in her wicked intent. \[Page 285\]

In the lower degrees there is no vision connected with the state, where the evil then appears like a monomaniac of the corresponding organs. Sprenger recounts: in Koblenz there was one struck with this evil who, in the presence of his wife, performed the act several times and could in no way be hindered from it by her wailing and cries; but always only replied: Let us begin anew! and that until complete exhaustion. No one was seen with him, and he, when questioned about it, answered: that he likewise saw no one, but felt himself driven by an irresistible force!

A woman was under suspicion in this regard because she had harshly threatened him with abusive words, on account of an insult, that she would do him in!²) If the vision joins in the progress of the development, then goblin-like appearances first make themselves known. Two sisters, honest and chaste, had the sensation as if something fell upon them at nighttime and pressed them like a heavy burden. In the moonlight it sometimes came like a dusky shadow-image, immediately throwing itself onto the bedcover. In addition, almost daily a terrible rumbling could be heard by day as well as by night; in addition a throwing about and a clamor, during which from time to time the black shadow became visible, even in the bright midday. It continued thus for half a year, until they left the dwelling, and it had even, right before the departure, once more increased in intensity.

In such cases the haunting also becomes visible to others. Thus Heurn reports of himself: how as a small boy he had slept at the side of a very respectable, unimpeachable matron; and when he once awoke from sleep, he had seen a black figure that seemed to lay itself over her onto the bedcover. In the morning she had complained how the Alp had pressed her; but he had not been permitted to tell her anything, because the figure had threatened him if he betrayed anything.¹) From this the observation is understood, which, as Sprenger reports, was made in various places. For suspected witches were seen, lying backwards in woods and fields, and performing the act. Finally a black vapor, the length of a man, had risen from them and dissolved in the air. However, the latter had seldom occurred; a circumstance which, given the obvious possibility of manifold deceptions, recommends caution in judgment.

Nider also knew in the Basel diocese a virgin, pious and of beautiful bodily form, who was his penitent; whose cell and bed was often disturbed by such a spirit through the frightful form that he assumed and through the noise that he made. She conducted herself in all this like a pure virgin, did not even allow her foot to be seen naked once, slept always clothed, and thus the Incubus did not dare to approach her.³) This vision sometimes rises to such tangibility that, in the absence of consent, it comes to a struggle between the demon and the afflicted person. The author of the *Specimens of British Prose Writers*, Barnett, relates an example of this from his own experience. Fifty years ago there lived in a village of Somersetshire an old woman who was generally regarded as a hag. Her body was dry, bent by age she went about on crutches. Her voice was hollow, of a mysterious but hypocritical solemnity; from her eyes went forth a piercing, stinging light that struck the one who looked at her with silent terror. \[Page 286\]

Suddenly a young, healthy man of 21--22 years from the same place was haunted by the Alp; so persistently and frequently that his health was attacked by it, and within 3--4 months he was weak, pale, emaciated, bearing all the signs of a life drawing to its end. Neither he nor any of his family had any doubt about the cause; and as he was resolved, he decided to wait for the hag while awake. For a long time he did not succeed in this; finally his resolution prevailed, and he now heard at midnight a soft, cautious step on the stairs. She came to the foot of the bed, climbed onto it, and then pressed herself slowly up along his feet. He let it happen until she had come to his knees and wanted to throw herself upon him with her full weight.

Now he seized her with both hands by the hair and held her fast with convulsive strength, while at the same time calling out to his mother, who was sleeping in the nearby room, that she should bring a light. While she ran for the light, the two of them struggled with each other in fury on the floor, for so long until, with the first glimmer from the stairs, the woman tore herself from his fists with supernatural force and vanished from his eyes like a flash of lightning. His mother found him standing there, still breathless from the exertion, holding both hands full of hair. When he, says Barnelt, recounted the incident to me, I asked him curiously where he had put the hair. He replied: It was clumsy of me that I did not keep it; that would have proven the identity of the person best. But in the storm of my emotions, I let it fall to the ground; and she to whom it belonged took care that it never came before my eyes again. But on that occasion I covered it over in such a way that she has not returned since to plague me. It is strange, he added, that while I seized her and wrestled with her, although I was certain that it must be she, yet her breath and her entire being seemed like that of a blooming young girl. The man to whom this happened still lives; he told me the story more than once; I can therefore vouch for the truth of the effect, whatever one may think of the cause.

This cause one can seek first in a vision of the agent himself, without great danger of erring, which went forth as a critical one into that struggle, which yielded with the first glimmer of light and let the one who had returned to consciousness glimpse the hair in the intermediate moments, which then vanished later on. But whether this vision was a merely one-sided one, proceeding from him, or whether the woman took part in it, cannot be determined from the circumstances cited, since the womanly appearance of the woman decides nothing in that regard. \[Page 287\]

If there is consent and thus the cooperation of the will in the matter, then the evil is very hard to heal. Thomas of Brabant had a nun in the confessional who said that she had never consented; which now put him in great astonishment as to why she had let it happen nonetheless. He therefore pressed her most earnestly, and finally received the confession that she had earlier, in spirit more than in body, taken the corruption into herself. She now became earnestly repentant and confessed continually amid many tears; but there was now nothing to be devised that could free her from her incubus: neither the sign of the cross, consecrations and blessings, nor even the altar sacrament itself, which terrifies the angels, would bring her help. The evil now seemed to persist in her as a punishment and only vanished after many years and much prayer. In its course, she once complained, on the eve of Pentecost, in 's-Hertogenbosch to a pious sister, Christine, of her misfortune, which took away her courage to go to communion.

Christine now said to her: Lie down calmly and go tomorrow to the Lord's table! For I will take your evil upon myself. She now went away joyfully, slept in peace, and rose in the morning and hastened to the sacrament. But Christine did not take seriously what she had undertaken; when she had gone to bed, however, she perceived, as she was falling asleep, that it was restless in her straw bedding, as if a piglet were stirring and moving about. She therefore got up unconcerned, sought to drive the animal away with the distaff, and then lay down again. She was roused again; and since this repeated itself several times, she finally recognized the trick, devoting herself to prayer; but in doing so she was so tormented by the Evil One that she had never endured anything like it. In the morning she said to the other: I am casting your evil back from me again, for I have escaped the violence of the tempter only at the risk of my life.

The misfortune is, however, also present where it appears as illness and possession, sometimes so malignant that it brings the reluctant one to death without any consent. In the year 1645, in the Bergomese territory, there was a youth of about 25 years, so attacked by a maleficium that he could neither eat, drink, nor perform other natural functions, indeed could scarcely breathe or speak. He came to Brognoli, who blessed him; and since the demonic revealed itself through various movements and exertions, he subdued it by means of ecclesiastical regulations. He now advised the youth to go to confession and communion, and then to seek out in Brescia a famous exorcist, because he himself at that time did not yet engage in exorcism. But this youth, once he recognized himself as possessed, cast the suspicion that he had caused the same upon an old woman, whose malice toward him he well knew. \[Page 288\]

Upon returning home, he therefore said to his friends and household companions: that he had been so ill-treated by the woman; he knew that she had done the same to others as well, and he therefore wanted to report her to the Inquisition. In the meantime, he had asked the superior of the monastery in his place to take him in for that night with a friend who was devoted to him. This was granted to him, but after the fourth hour of the night, while he was fully awake in the room, with the window and door standing open, he saw that woman come into the room, climb onto the bed, and seize him by the throat with her hands, so that he was nearly strangled. He sought to hold her off from himself with all his might, reviling her with many abusive words; and so great was the force that he exerted in the process that his bedstead was broken by it; all of which his companion heard, without, however, seeing anyone.

And it did not stop at one time; after half an hour, the apparition attacked him in the other bed, where he lay with his friend, and sought to drag him out of it. But the companion held him back, embracing him, sensing a great force and much exertion against his struggling, but otherwise still seeing no one. The result was that the head and neck of the unfortunate one swelled up so much that he was entirely disfigured by it, and behaved like a madman; foaming at the mouth, gnashing his teeth, striking himself against the floor, and intent upon hurling himself down from it. In the morning, he told me everything, in the presence of many witnesses; with a rough and broken voice, he complained about the old woman, and added: "The woman torments me, and will not stop until she has killed me." And that came to pass around the ninth hour of the same day, when he died.

It was said to have been observed that that old woman had not been in the church that morning in her usual manner; she was not seen until the evening after the death of the wretch. The suspicion also seemed confirmed by the death of her niece, who died within less than a month of an unusual illness; a death that was attributed to a maleficium, because she had loved that youth passionately, and now, grieving over his death, had recounted that it had happened through a bite that the old woman had offered him. She herself betrayed herself: by afterward threatening the youth's companion, who had been an eyewitness to everything, with the same death if he did not keep silent. In any case, one sees from this incident that the evil, at the height of its development, can become life-threatening. \[Page 289\]

egarding the healing of the affliction, Brognoli without doubt introduced the best practice in his circle. As he reports, when I had returned to Bergamo in 1650, a girl had me asked through her confessor for my help, who told me: she had been visited daily for some time by an incubus, in the form of a clergyman whom she loved, and could by no means free herself from his power; although she resisted bravely 1) Alexicacon Disp. II. No. 505. p. 163. 437 and had performed great penances for this liberation. I now instructed her in all acts of faith and trust, advised her to attack the incubus with all kinds of curses, mockery, and derision, and then blessed the room and the bed. I then commanded that in this room, with a lamp burning, in another bed, two other nuns of the same congregation, venerable and mature through their age, should lie down there undaunted and with fresh courage, in such a way that, while one slept, the other knelt watching at the bed and continually observed the one plagued by the demon, whether she showed any movement in her face, around her mouth, or on the rest of her body. If she noticed anything like that, she was to immediately wake the other and command the demon in the name of the Lord to depart from there, and to pull the one plagued by him out of the bed. All together were then to kneel, pray the psalm Miserere, give themselves the discipline, and after that recite the Litany of the Holy Virgin.

Before midnight of the first watch, the incubus came and began, invisible to the one watching, to press upon the sleeping one; she in turn made some movement with her mouth and face and gave a thin, lamenting sound. The one watching woke her companion; both together now fearlessly seized the sleeping one to pull her out of the bed. But the demon held her back strongly; they pulled harder but could by no means overcome the power of the demon. Finally, the command that I had advised came to one of them; and she commanded the demon in the name of Jesus to depart from there! He now fled, and the three immediately carried out what I had assigned to them. On the following day, when I visited the convent and heard what had happened, I encouraged them to continue fighting bravely against the demon, blessed the room again, and commanded the demon never to dare approach her again. Now, although he showed himself in the following night and even ventured to enter through the door, he did not go as far as the bed.

The afflicted one saw him indeed in the form of the clergyman whom she loved; but she drove him easily to flight by invoking the name of Jesus. On my part, I repeated my advice on the following day, as before. In the third night, the apparition indeed returned, but invisibly, and only causing some slight noise in the chamber; then he completely left the afflicted one, and she was completely freed with God's help. That was without doubt the most rational manner of treatment. The nun had directed her entire intention toward the object of her love, and he appeared to her as a spiritual vampire. \[Page 290\]

In the moment of the attack, she was pressed upon; the heaviness that she felt, she also exerted outward, and the other nuns perceived this heaviness when they tried to pull the sick one out of the bed. The instructions that the exorcist had given, effective in two directions, uprooted the evil at its root; and it vanished, now gradually making a stepwise lysis. Otherwise, it is St. Cajetan whose help is frequently invoked in such cases. In life he was distinguished by the greatest purity, and he tolerated nothing that could cast even the slightest shadow upon it. Therefore he had the property, both during his lifetime and after his death---as proven by many witnesses in the process---of freeing those who had long suffered from the temptation to lust.

All who had come near him for this purpose attested: he then exhaled the most delightful scent of oranges, which, spreading far and wide, lingered for a long time. But the agrumi are held, on account of their evergreen nature, to be a symbol of virginity. Therefore he also drove out the demons that incited to such things, and his life recounts many instances thereof. Thus there was in Vicenza a respectable woman who suffered from this affliction. After a strong attack she had come near to falling; when the Saint, to whom she had commended herself from the bottom of her heart, appeared to her clothed in light, and drove out the evil spirits in the form of serpents. He then reproved the woman, who from then on suffered no such temptation again; only that later once she felt herself strongly impelled to spit upon his image, which she had hung up for her protection.

From the course of the investigation thus far, it has emerged: that the affection often takes its origin from a topical disease which has found its seat in the corresponding organs; and that it then, with or without the cooperation of the will, can rise from stage to stage up to a local possession. Once it has arrived at this point, it will by no means be necessary that it now stand still, and, confining itself within the bounds of its system, not dare to venture beyond them. But if it breaks forth over these bounds, then this can happen in a twofold manner, one of which goes more inward, the other more outward. Beside that sphere of life which most closely belongs to the drive dedicated from its course, other regions of the same life-circle border; and beyond these, up to the spirit, yet others and others still, which rise above life, and now all can be drawn into sympathy. \[Page 291\]

The evil may therefore, breaking forth from its seat, and in regressus burrowing deeper and deeper, overspread system after system; until it finally arrives at the innermost center with the spiritual powers. It will then, after it has taken possession of the whole man, imprint upon him its stamp and its color; it will fetter all the higher regions of the same to its own center; thus imprinting upon the whole its hysterical character, and thereby shaping itself in him into a practice and doctrine, into a system, indeed into a kind of philosophy and sexual mysticism. Or, since the region in which it nests is surrounded outward by similar life-spheres, which in any case already stand in a certain connection with one another through the sexual natural rapport; so the morbidly excited drive, overflowing, may also leap over from life to life in that magnetic bond, spreading itself outwardly progressive, and infecting all that is attuned to it in a certain consonance, preparing for itself a sphere of action outward. Thus there will arise a sexual disease which on the lower stages has the character of a natural evil; but on the higher appears as a social sexual possession. Let us go through both forms of the evil in sequence.

The first was found in a certain Mabertha, who in the year 1615 was taken into his house by a noble and worthy man, Suerz, at the request of his wife, a matron equally pious; since she boasted of a higher grace overflowing, and at her frequent confessions and communions of higher absolution and exhortation. This first made her host suspicious whether she might not be subject to the deception of Satan; and he insisted that she consult a pious and learned man. She replied: she had already done so many times, and received various answers; later, however, agreeing, she had, in order to withdraw herself again from this promise, spent 15 days outside the house with a friend.

Lately urged once more to approach a bishop who was present at that place on this account; she had finally yielded, had gone to the bishop, and he had directed her to a Dominican, a pious, experienced man proven in the examination of spirits. But she would not follow this instruction; the father would demand a general confession from her, and also, to test her, would withhold communion from her for a long time; moreover, an inner voice had forbidden her to go to him. In the meantime she spoke various suspicious things again. She was without all sin, even without venial; God hearkens to her in all that she desires. She sees the inner man; God unites himself bodily with her, and she often falls into ecstasy outside herself. \[Page 292\]

She said to her hosts: they could attain the same if they would only renounce the imprint of evil with which they were born, and all high-mindedness and all vanity and discord. When it was replied to her: we do all that, she rejoined: You still have a veil before your eyes, I will pray to God that he remove it from you! Suerz now pressed all the more eagerly that she go to the father, with whom he had previously spoken, and she finally consented. He received her kindly; but she was at first somewhat abashed, and said nothing. The father then said: I have heard much of your rare virtues; I hope through you to gain closer knowledge of them for my own good. But she answered: I am a sinner; and to that he: That comes surely only from your humility; I hope you will not hide your graces from me. They are rare, these graces, on account of my sinfulness, said she; and he again: Your ecstasies and illuminations, the seeing through of spirits, the foresight, all that is well known to me; God does not grant such things to wicked people.

She now came two or three times out of herself before the father; he fell upon his knees and besought God for his help, and then he said to her: O blessed one, you who are so closely united with God, and enjoy his sacred embraces! She rejoined: In that you speak truly! So he spoke back and forth, and plainly recognized that she was exceedingly vain, thought greatly of herself, and had a mighty desire for praise and honor. He said to her now: It seems to me in all this that your humility yet deserves a higher reward; and it appears fitting to me that the body also should share in the enjoyment, as is the case with bride and bridegroom. By these words she was, as it were, transported out of herself, and said: You speak the truth, my father! and no one has yet spoken so aptly therein as you. The father then asked whether God was visible to her, how often and under what form he united himself with her.

She took pleasure in these questions, and said: she did not see her God, but felt him very well; she rejoiced for full two to three hours in his embraces, and gave things to understand that cannot well be repeated. The father said in response: It sometimes dreams to me that I come into company with many people; do you also have such dreams? She answered: Indeed! and when asked: what then the people did together? she replied: They worship God, eat and drink, and are in good spirits for two to four hours. She now went away very pleased, and promised to come again soon. At home she immediately recounted: such as this she had found none before; she would never have another confessor, he had approved everything about her. Believe me, she added, he will yet learn much from me that is not in his books! for the father is actually a simple man, of no great intellectual gifts, who would easily be deceived. Thereafter she went to him more often, and soon let herself out openly against him: that she believed in another God than the God of the Christians, and in another Virgin. \[Page 293\]

She lived with him as man and wife, she had already told the landlady, and confided to the landlord: that she had already been in this state of grace for ten years. When he expressed that he too wished to enter among these elect, she made revelations to him that would have determined him to expel her from the house, had not the father begged him to have patience with her for a while longer. She now advanced further, and said to the landlord, who complained of inner unrest and uncertainty on the new path: since he had begun so happily, she would not conceal from him that above all he must renounce baptism and the Christian Trinity, pride, vanity, and discord. For among them there existed an entirely different Trinity, which the father did not yet know; and when she had declared herself for this one in her night of birth, the angels of the Lord had appeared to her.

She also confessed that she was marked; she recounted how she spent the nights sleepless, lingering five, six, seven hours in the work of love with her God. Other joys, in comparison with these, were utterly void, because the powers of God were inexhaustible, and his might penetrated to the heart. On the eve of All Saints' Day she said impatiently to her landlords: Had you done in time as I have taught you; then we would be merry together tonight, on one of the principal feasts of the year. She went to bed early in the evening, and when the niece of the house, who slept with her, said in the morning: You said that you had to go to the feast tonight, and yet you did not leave your bed; she replied: You are still too young to comprehend how that can happen.

She often recounted how things went at the banquets, and spoke of three orders: the first sought only enjoyment and union with God, of whom there were 36, mostly poor and powerless women; the second desired knowledge, insight, and understanding; the third riches, dignities, honors, goods, and these were mostly esteemed people who dreamed only of ambition. There was also a virgin there, with the Christ-child on her lap; but this would first reveal itself in its glory after the destruction of Paradise. All were now filled with horror against these abominations and blasphemies; the father too had obtained what he wanted; and when she therefore appeared before him again in the confessional, he uncovered for her the abyss of perdition in which she wandered in her delusion.

She was at first frightened, and became as if stunned; then she began to weep and to accuse herself of sorcery. But the emotion lasted only a short time, then the old hardness returned, and she departed with the words: The hour of my conversion has not yet come; but you will have no cause to complain of me. At home she said that she must have three or four days to consider. But since they no longer wished to tolerate her in the house, she left it; yet she continued to hold conversations that pointed toward conversion. However, since she feared an accusation, she resolved, on the advice of her friends, to preempt it, and now accused the father: that he had sought to seduce her into sorcery, had made her deny Christ, had allowed himself attacks on her chastity, and had given her consecrated hosts in order to commit abuses with them. Confronted with him before the convent, she at first repeated her accusation; but then she suddenly fell at his feet, confessing that she had spoken untruth, and that she was the most wretched of all creatures. \[Page 294\]

As in this case a grossly demonic nymphomania, in the one who deliberately deceived herself, was elevated to the highest union; so has this evil sometimes spread in the opposite direction, from above downward. As I, Brognoli recounts, was staying in Venice in 1664, the vicar general of a bishop from the mainland came to me to seek counsel regarding the following incident.

In a convent of nuns there was a nun who was greatly devoted to fasting and abstinence, though according to her own will. Her desire and love were moreover directed toward reading profane books that dealt with the transformations wrought by Circe and other enchantresses, or those performed by the ancient gods, by which they changed men into animals, birds, serpents, and spirits. One night, the form of an exceedingly beautiful youth came to this nun, and as she gazed at him in astonishment, he said to her:

"Do not fear, my dearest sister! Are you not that nun who loves fasting beyond all measure, and have you not devoted yourself to it with your whole heart? Know then that I am the angel called Fasting, and I come to you to thank you and to meet your love with equal love. Once I was a king's son; but in my youthful years, in which you too now still stand, I greatly loved fasting and devoted myself entirely to it; so my father, seeing this with displeasure, rebuked me harshly for it. But I, disregarding his admonitions, persisted in my will; for which reason he, full of anger, cast me out of the house. But the gods whom I revered, and who disapproved of such banishment, took me in and transformed me into an angel. As they now gave me the name Fasting, they added the privilege that I may assume the form of a youth as you see me, so that I never age. Moreover, I am endowed with such swiftness that in an inconceivably short time I move from one part of the world to another, coming and going invisibly; but to those who love me, I become visible. Since the gods have now indicated to me that you have directed your whole love toward me, I come to you now to offer my thanks, to stay with you, and to serve you in all things according to your pleasure. For this reason I have today completed the great journey; so let me sleep tonight in your little bed, if it pleases you; fear nothing in my company, for I am a friend of chastity and modesty."

The nun, now most delighted by this speech and lured by it, took him into her bed. The first night passed well, and he did not touch her. But on the second, he began, as a sign of gratitude and love, to embrace and kiss her; then he did not cease from her by day or by night, and he admonished her never to reveal the secret to her confessor or to anyone else. He served her most zealously and followed her everywhere through the convent and the garden, like a faithful servant and companion. Finally, in the year 1664, when the time of the Jubilee came, the nun was seized by remorse in her heart and disclosed everything to her confessor, who persuaded her to reveal the matter outside of confession to the vicar general of the diocese, so that he might take the appropriate measures to free her from the evil. \[Page 295\]

This vicar general now came to me to seek counsel in the matter, which I duly provided. In this remarkable psychological case, the disordered inclination toward fasting, combined with an equally extravagant one toward the fables of the ancients, merged into one; and as the nun persistently directed her attention there, the combination personified itself in that apparition which she experienced and which belonged to the demonic side of human nature. Since she found herself equipped with beauty and youth, the third sensual element soon entered in, and by an established path an incubus was now made from the abstinent king's son. The evil gains its spread in another way when it breaks through the barrier of personality and then spreads over an entire community.

By the nature of the matter, such diffusion will occur most frequently in nunneries, where the evil itself takes root most easily; and now in close living together, under entirely similar influences, the spread of what has taken hold is promoted by the most similar disposition. I could, Alvaro Pelagio recounts, in such a cloister hardly eradicate this demonic plague through many penances, good counsel, and sermons. The demons had established such great familiarity with many of the nuns that these no longer shuddered at their sight; but instead conversed with them without any fear, and allowed themselves to be assailed by them, as I learned from their judicial confession. Likewise, other theologians speak from their practical experience.

If the mischief takes on more the character of possession, then it also manifests here in a more goblin-like manner. In Hessimont near Neumagen, the nuns, as Wyer, the body physician of Cleve, recounts, were plagued for many years by a spirit that at nightfall, like in a whirlwind, burst into the dormitory; and then played so sweetly on the zither that the nuns might have been lured to dance. Then it leaped in the form of a dog into the bed of one of them, upon whom a harsh suspicion thereby fell. Even more vexatious things had occurred in the same cloister, during the lifetime of Father Paulus; which the reporter, since those affected had suppressed it, did not wish to make public. In another, not insignificant cloister of the Cologne diocese, a similar mischief held its haunt, which for eight years went about in the form of a dog, and slipped into the undergarments of the nuns, in order through the movements it caused in them to betray signs of unclean doings. It is easy to interpret such things as erotic, very palpable haunting; but harder then to comprehend the long-standing blindness of all the uninterested parties; without, which of course costs little, declaring an entire cloister a brothel.

That, moreover, where the matter appears more in the form of obsession, it took its first origin in the same way, is proved by the example of the nuns of Nazareth in Cologne, which the same witness recounts. They had been, says the physician, disturbed for many years by various devilish afflictions; when suddenly in the year 1564 a gruesome spectacle arose among them. They were thrown to the ground, entirely in the manner of the act; during the course of which they always kept their eyes closed, and only opened them afterward with great shame. A young girl of fourteen years, who had been enclosed in the cloister, had given the first occasion for it. She had often experienced these strange apparitions in her bed, and had been discovered by her giggling over them; and although she strove to ward off the haunting with a consecrated stole, it nevertheless returned every night. One had placed a sister in bed with her to help fend off the apparition; but the poor thing was miserably frightened when she heard the noise of the struggle. She was finally completely possessed and wretchedly plagued by convulsions. \[Page 296\]

When she had her seizure, it seemed as if her vision were impeded; and even when she gave the appearance of being in her right mind, she yet uttered strange and uncertain words that bordered on despair. Several soon followed her lead, and thus the pestilence gained more and more ground; especially when, in their great distress, they resorted to forbidden means. I examined these occurrences as a physician in the cloister on the 2nd of May 1565, in the presence of the noble and sensible gentlemen Constantin von Lyskerken, worthy councilor, and Master Johann Altenan, formerly dean of Cleve. Also present were: Master Johann Echst, excellent doctor of medicine; finally my son Heinrich, likewise doctor of medicine and of philosophy.

I read, on this occasion, terrible letters that the young girl had written to her lover; but none of us all doubted for even a moment that they had been written by the possessed one in her attack. It turned out that the cause of the evil had come from some dissolute young people who, after they had, during ball-playing nearby, arranged a love affair with some nuns, soon thereafter climbed over the walls to enjoy themselves with their beloved ones. The matter had been discovered, and their paths barred; but now the devil, that thousand-cunning artist, poisoned the fancy of the poor things, and conjured up before them the forms of their friends, and made them perform the whole play before the eyes of all the world. I sent letters to the convent, in which I laid the whole matter out for them, and prescribed the appropriate and Christian means by which they could bring this sad tragedy to an end.

This instructive case offers everything necessary to form a clear conception of the origin and spread of the evil. The break-in into the cloister had made the nuns involved fully acquainted with the practice of the thing. The break-in was stopped, and the encircling wall restored; the evil was now hedged about and enclosed, and, repelled from without, it gnawed inward in the lonely seclusion, and at last took firm root in the inner sphere of life. It had now escaped the cloister for the second time; for walls cannot hinder the far-reaching effect into the distance, here mediated through the unchained drive; and the binding of the outer eyes cannot prevent the opening of the inner ones.

Thus the earlier communion was reestablished only in a higher realm; what it lost in tangible reality was compensated in a correspondingly greater intensive concentration; and since the act occurred in a state of unconsciousness to itself, the guardian of shame slept, and he, otherwise driven back into the hidden, now had to step forth openly. But understanding spins itself onward in the intervals, in a kind of demonic correspondence, which likewise is carried on in the attacks of that unconsciousness, spinning the magnetic rapport across the wall, where the realm of the duties of one's station parts from that of the forbidden, thus of the evil. But if the fire has once kindled on this side of that hedge, then it kindles onward in all equally prepared and attuned ones, and the evil now spreads miasmatically.

##### ii. The Love Spell and the Tying of Love Knots

\[Page 297\]

The events in the convent of Nazareth, where the incubus assumed the form of a definite person from whom the evil had originally proceeded, lead over into a realm where the drive makes use of artificial means to bind the lust to definite persons, or to make it impossible for others to practice the same. In ordinary life, where every personality stands round and closed and bounded, and repels everything that might thrust itself upon it by force, there are no other means of the kind than those in which the instincts to mutual sympathy are aroused; where then, in the play of spiritual and bodily elective affinities, the mutual process of appropriation is accomplished. But this drive, like the life that pours itself into it, is not of simple nature; it has indeed a simple element within it, but also a manifold one, and from the relation of the two depends its tension or its slackening in degree. It also dwells, like life itself, in an organic bearer, and this too is grasped in a much-divided unity and graded stepwise; this indwelling vital force manifests itself outward, and translates its intensity into the extensive.

The entire life complex thus has an outer bodily side, in which the entire vitality collects itself toward this side; and \[it has\] toward the outside a limited, extensive sphere of action, and an inner \[side\], through which the living element in it is connected with the soul-related, derives its power from it, and exerts a determinate, inwardly psychic effect. If all this, according to the measure of ordinary life, works together in an ordered sequence; then the inner act also reflects itself, in each of the sexes, in the outer \[relations\] between them, and the process runs its course in the usual, orderly track. But this order can be disturbed in a twofold manner: either through disordered influences that disturb the equilibrium in the organically bodily, so that it becomes protrusive in more or less degree; or through such \[influences\] that throw themselves more upon the inner spiritual side, and assign to it the preponderance. Both kinds will find their consideration in turn.

The way of building, through physical \[means\], thus also through those acting directly upon the bodily, a bridge to a foreign personality, has naturally been the first one upon which men hit. There it was soon found that there are substances which in such a way act specifically stimulating upon those organs, the aphrodisiacs; and others again which possess a depressing effect, thus appearing opposed to those. In the first case the life flame burns more strongly in the organ, its inner gradated strength increases, and its sphere of action expands. But the direction of the thus strengthened drive goes in general; there is no means to give it a determinate direction toward a particular person, if this one does not throw itself in its way.

In the other case the life breaking forth toward this side is held down, and its manifestations are dammed up, again against all and every one; so that thus the intended personality also finds itself only incidentally hit. Since now on the one hand it is aimed at the gaining, on the other hand at the denial of the coarser pleasure; since through the immoderate heightening of the drive that which is irresistible, which lies in the matter itself, is heightened almost to irresistibility, and the satisfaction in the positive case can only take place at the cost of life, but the paralysis in the other does not redound to its benefit; so the inevitable consequences of the use of these means are exhaustion, madness, and the drying up of all life sources. \[Page 298\]

The physicians have made manifold experiences concerning these consequences, and Heer has one such, which we will here only mention in passing. To a fourteen-year-old youth, exhausted and thirsting through walking, a girl known to him had put such a philtrum into the beer; as, she said, above all suitable to lift the fatigue. The youth had drunk with greed, thereupon slept deeply the whole night; but found himself in the morning assailed by great weariness, so that he could scarcely drag himself home. A hemorrhage, through mouth and anus and urine, in superabundant quantity, occurred; ligatures were not able to staunch it. Only sympathetic means could staunch the blood flow, which however returned upon their abandonment; so that the tears which he wept were blood, and blood secreted itself in the ears. The former means indeed stilled the blood, but the young man became more and more enfeebled; so that at last he was held for dead, and as a corpse, sewn into a cloth, laid aside.

He came to himself, however, fell into excessive sweat, and finally a thumb-thick crust formed over his entire body, which compelled him to stand for six days and nights on a pole until the rash had dried up, and life, at such a price, had expelled the intruded harmfulness once more.

Kircher tells: A youth noticed that, whenever he visited a spot in his garden, distinguished equally by its greenery as by the freshness of its shade, he was each time moved by a violent impulse to lust; so that it seemed as if he had been seized by satyriasis. It happened once, however, that he confided this strange matter to the apothecary Heinrich Corvinus in intimate conversation. The latter, having formed a suspicion about the cause of the affair, had himself led to the spot; and found it entirely overgrown with satyrium, belonging to a particular species. After this discovery, it was easy for him to explain the cause of the violent symptom; since the plant excites many merely when they carry it in their hands.

We have seen above, from the confessions of the Bavent, how the same thing happened to her: when she came near the place on the churchyard where Picard, making use of her finger, had buried drops of her menstruation caught in the host. One may make every allowance for her imagination in this, but the event undeniably shows that the buried thing had acted just like the satyrium above, and that this effect could not be a direct physical one: that here too her nature had inverted itself, and that, in her inner being turning outward, she had acquired excitability for stimuli which otherwise pass unnoticed by the ordinary person. She had entered a realm where sympathy and attraction do not stand in inverse proportion to the distances; but where spirits and things draw toward or flee from one another, without regard to remoteness, solely according to the relation of their inner gradated tensions. As here the spatial dimensions are without significance, so too do the physical qualities in themselves lose their own, and count only as signs of inner spiritual qualities.

The same occurs in the deeper circle, where the sympathetic cures find their place; a region which, despite much superstition that has mingled in it, yet likewise has a foundation of undeniable truth within itself. All philtres in this circle are therefore of a symbolic kind; so that nature provides only the outer shell, while the truly inner effective part forms the higher core of the matter. The enjoyment to which these symbolic entwinements lead can therefore likewise be only of a symbolic kind. It occurs therefore only in the vision, which, from its originally merely potential meaning, completes itself in the radically evil, and realizes itself as a demonic one. \[Page 299\]

What the poetic legend knows to tell of the green candle, which, when lit, leads the beloved through night and fog to the lover---that can never happen in ordinary life in flesh and bone; but rather in the spirit, in visionary phantasmagoria, or in demonic reality. All those vincula directed against the drive therefore draw, in their ultimate effect, toward the Sabbath; directly connecting a relation with its Lord, they lead into the harem of the Grand Master of all incubi and succubi. Indirectly, however, only uniting the sexes, either crosswise in the dissimilar or even straight across in the similar, and seeking the union then only in the radically evil---from this proceeds the mingling of sorcerers and sorceresses in the synagogue,³ where those philtres are applied on both sides, and therefore also appear doubled in their efficacy.

The ordinary Incubus and Succubus is merely the domestic Sabbath, and the private worship; just as the pharmacy of those symbolic philters is only the orgies of this common Sabbath, under the protection of the Penates, in the house-sanctuary of the demon, celebrated privately. Already Jerome tells us in the Life of the holy. A connection, which, by the way, is not viewed there with too favorable an eye; for when Brognoli questioned that Manichaean sorcerer, of whom we spoke much earlier, he blushed: the demons sought to prevent it. But to mix with demons is the greatest merit, a distinguished virtue, and a work most worthy of all praise, since they themselves are angelic spirits, by nature most noble and most illustrious.

Hilarion tells of such a case: where a lover, on the advice of the priests of Asclepius, made use of such a bond, and the girl became raving mad with love over it. Another case, reported by Brognoli, gives us insight into the progress of the evil, once it has taken root. In Venice, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a merchant was greatly loved by her father's servant, who, in order to gain possession of her, resorted to a sorcerer, who struck her with the maleficium of love. She suddenly began to scream one night: "I will die if I cannot sleep with this one." The elders ran to her, and were astonished at the girl's words, who otherwise was distinguished by modesty. But the demon, who possessed her maid, betrayed the perpetrator, who immediately fled.

The next morning I was called, and questioned the girl: whether she had spoken those words with full intent? She replied: how suddenly she had found her heart inflamed with love toward the servant; fantasy and imagination had been clouded, the understanding beclouded, the will urged on by repeated and pressing demands. At the same time, she had been inwardly, by a violent impulse of lust toward coitus, also against her will, driven; so that she could not refrain from crying out those words. She was healed by the use of spiritual means.

The above-indicated origin of the whole condition gives us insight: why with its development, related symptoms of demonic possession often emerge as well. For example, the aversion to all things spiritual, as it showed itself in that Johann Hilpat, the servant of a nobleman. He had received and eaten from his master's maid or cook cakes, into which such a philter had been baked. For four days he felt nothing, but on the fifth he began to delirious, to rage, to speak all manner of absurd things; suffered from persistent insomnia; imagined that he was in the power of the devil, and could not endure the presence of the local pastor, at whose sight he broke out in sweat from fear. \[Page 300\]

Likewise, in the neighboring domains of these realms, the magical emissions often occur. In the year 1589, there lived in Genoa a youth, who was otherwise well-formed, who suddenly burned with such fierce love toward a woman that he forgot God, and devoted himself only to this his passion. For three months, secret meetings and love letters were exchanged back and forth, until finally the youth fell ill with a violent sickness. Then it was astonishing, what and how manifold filth he spewed from himself in the presence of many witnesses: women's hair, egg shells, cotton, hair and straight pins, nail clippings and bone fragments, various iron scraps in no small number, all mixed with blood. One of the clerics, a Jesuit, exhorted him: that he should no longer allow himself to be bound by such a pernicious love affair; and finally questioned him, whether he perhaps possessed any belongings or letters from her? He confessed: that he had indeed received letters, but had torn them up.

The clergyman gave no credence to this assertion, and advised his own people to make search in his cabinets; and if they should find anything relating to the love affair, to take it away. As this matter became known to the patient through a secret voice, he demanded the key of the cabinet with terrible outcry: and when he had obtained it, he brought the same, at the exhortation of that same voice, to his mouth, to swallow it, if he had not been prevented therefrom. He then laid it under his pillow, and now lost the light of his eyes. The mother exhorted him that he, now made wise by experience, should give back the key. He therefore sought after it; but as he could not find it, he believed that it had been stolen from him; and he now began to scream and lament even more violently, as he searched the whole bed for it. Meanwhile, the cabinet had been broken open by force, and as two love letters were found in it, they were consigned to the flames; whereupon he immediately recovered the use of his sight, and saw the key lying before his eyes with astonishment. He now began to heal, both in body and soul, and was soon entirely restored as before.

A case of this kind, of a poisoning turned inward through a philtre, which obtained a judicial investigation, is that which befell Maria Elisabeth de Ranfain, the daughter of a respectable house, of great beauty and even greater holiness, around the year 1622. Her parents had forced her into marriage, but after a few years her husband had died; a physician, Poiret, had now cast a violent passion upon her, and had given her such a philtre. She had felt its effect, but had suppressed it with prayers, tears, and vows. Poiret had now managed to administer a second one to her; various ills had thereupon afflicted her, and her parents had compelled her to send for Poiret; but as she distrusted him, she had dismissed him again. \[Page 301\]

This drove the physician out of his senses with rage; but Elisabeth soon fell into unnatural states. One half of her body showed itself stiffened in frost, and without sensation; while the other was in such violent agitations that, notwithstanding the delicacy of her constitution, four of the strongest persons could scarcely hold her. Now one saw her head (in the sutures of the skull) open itself, then close again to the astonishment of those present; while at another time it swelled up in a monstrous manner. The matter caused a sensation; the physician and his adherents spread about that it was all natural effects; consequences of the patient's cunning and confused imagination. Her bishop therefore had her brought to Nancy; six of the most renowned physicians of the city were called in; they examined the matter thoroughly, and at last gave their unanimous testimony to this effect: among the various symptoms of this illness there were some which could only take their origin in a principle foreign to nature.

The most insightful clergymen were now consulted by the bishop, and several respected bishops took part when the exorcism was applied. All declared unanimously: the patient was possessed by evil spirits, and only audacity could deny this truth. In fact, she was hurled into the heights with such violence that six persons could scarcely hold her down. She climbed in the trees, from branch to branch, with the ease of the nimblest animals. One saw her, entirely lifted into the air, turning herself about in a wondrous manner.

She fulfilled everything that was commanded unto her in the Italian, German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues, as we have already heard elsewhere; she read a sealed Latin letter, and pointed out the error of an omitted letter. Countless witnesses were present at all these proceedings. The clamor roundabout grew ever greater, the spirits of the sick testified continually against Poiret; this man at last made preparations for flight, whereupon Heinrich II of Lorraine, otherwise a mild regent, caused him to be arrested, and his trial to be instituted. The greatest caution and circumspection were observed in the matter. Magistrates, whom he had requested from France, joined with the natives to form a tribunal of ninety-four judges.

The accused found defenders; a doctor of theology wrote a book in his favor; a princess expended great sums for his liberation, and the Infanta of the Netherlands wrote on his account unto the Duke. The woman was not spared: she was accused of a hypocrisy at which the most shrewd wits would come to shame; whereupon her two daughters were also arrested, and she herself shut up on water and bread. All who took her part were slandered. A prince of Lorraine, who was a bishop, was to feed her secretly in his palace with dainties. What she did and said was twisted to the worst sense, she herself overwhelmed with every sort of indignity; her letters were broken open, and men wrote at their pleasure whatsoever they would into them; unknown persons pursued her with loaded pistols, but were disarmed in the decisive moment by a secret terror. In the morning rope ladders were found at her window, and footprints in the sand, and she was poisoned several times; a reward of a thousand pistoles, it was said, had been promised to whoever would kill her. \[Page 302\]

She therefore had to be guarded by watches. The prosecution meanwhile watched over her; the slanderous writings that were spread against her were refuted by the most thorough investigation of every action of her life; the exorcisms that the Duchess had instituted were at last continued at the instigation of the Bishop. The trial proceeded quietly on its course, and after the investigation had reached its goal, the 24 judges unanimously agreed upon the death sentence for Poiret. His friends managed to prevent the execution; the Sovereign ordered a new revision, with the same result; the judgment had to be carried out on April 1, 1622, and he died without showing any sign of remorse. After his death, God willed, for the justification of the judges, that Anna Bouley, the companion in all his crimes, should be arrested in Paris with all her magical documents and brought to Nancy. In the remorse that seized her, she confessed her crimes and gave all testimonies of her sorceries.

The judges, on their side, not relying on her statement alone, conducted all necessary inquiries; and finally condemned her to death, which was just as edifying as Poiret's had been terrible. Several who had engaged in the same wicked practices were deterred by these events; some apostates returned to the bosom of the Church, and the court and nobility visibly improved their morals.¹ How the folk legend, however, takes the matter, shows itself in an amusing way in the following tale. My lecturer, P. Syn. Lupus, author of the Commentary on the reserved cases of Bergamo, and on the Edict of St. Ing., told me how he had known three men from Bergamo, followers of the priest Simon, who was notorious throughout Lombardy as a magician, and who had agreed among themselves: to demand from the demon a thousand gold pieces for each, and in addition, for all in common, the enjoyment of a beautiful girl.

Accordingly, they invoked the demon, who appeared to them and promised to perform everything if they would surrender their souls to him. They were, however, first to procure some hairs from the girl and lay them on an altar in the forest, near the girl's house; where they were then to sacrifice them to him with incense and worship him as God. They pledged their souls to the demon and then went to the girl's house to ask her for some of her hairs. She refused for a time; but then pretended to consent and cut some hairs from the cow in the stable, which she handed over to them as her own. Immediately they built the altar, put on mass vestments, lit coals in the censer, and invoked the demon, who soon appeared and laid the thousand gold pieces for each upon the altar. But now the cow suddenly broke out of the stable, rushed into the forest; and attacking the magicians with horns and teeth, and leaping upon them with her legs, wounded one after the other, destroyed the altar, and overturned the candlesticks and everything. The people came running up, found the magicians thus badly beaten, and brought them before the Inquisitor; who had them seized, investigated their case, and sent them to the galleys. \[Page 303\]

As for knot-tying at last, Bodin reports the following on that subject. When I was in 1567 at Poitiers, serving as substitute for the royal prosecutor at the great assizes, it happened that several gentlemen were accused before me. When I had now returned home and explained to my landlady the lawsuit in question, just as it had actually occurred---she being a respectable and well-regarded woman---she in turn recounted, as a highly experienced woman in matters of such arts, in the presence of the secretary Jakob von Beauvais, the following. First, that there were fully fifty kinds and manners of nestelknüpfen; one, by which one could bind a husband alone. The other, by which one could prevent begetting alone.

There would also be another kind whereby one loved the other, to be sure, but nothing was forbidden to it in the utmost degree; and another whereby they loved one another most fervently, but when they were to see one another, they would horribly scratch and strike each other. Of such a story it had been told in Toulouse concerning a couple who thus stood together for three years, then without having begotten children with one another. Moreover, the woman said that one could most easily hold back the man with it; indeed, one could hold him bound in impotence for a day, for a year, for all his lifetime, at least so long as the nestel remained entwined.

There would be people who could be entwined only for begetting, not for mingling; some for whom it would be impossible to effect the entwinement; others who would be susceptible to the matter only before marriage, not after it. She also recounted that one could knot people's urine, which she called nailing shut, from which many of them would then have to die. The aforementioned landlady of ours also told us all the particular sayings and words that belonged to each entwinement; which knotting spells were yet so indistinct and incomprehensibly twisted that neither a Greek, a Hebrew, a Latinist, nor anyone of the more recent nations could have understood them.

Piraitins in his eighth eclogue claims that one should make nine knots; she, however, knew only of one, and indicated of what leather and what color the knotting nestel must be. And since such things had become very ingrained and common in the land of Poitou, in the year 1560 the criminal judge at Niort, on the mere accusation of a young bride who for that reason sued her neighbor that she had knotted her bridegroom, threw the same into a dark tower and threatened her that he would not release her from this prison for her whole life unless she unbound the knotted man. Thereupon the prisoner, two days later, had summoned the young married couple to try it again. As soon as the judge had learned that the entwined ones were rid of the magic bond, he had released the binder and loosener freely again. \[Page 304\]

It lies on the hand that all the nonsense of formulas and manipulations which those fifty different kinds of nestelknüpfen possessed could do the least bit over a healthy, sound, unharmed nature. On the other hand, the time was not so unbelievably stupid and foolish that it would have employed all its wit on the devising of so many different methods if nothing at all corresponding to the intent had come out of it; and not fearful enough to fill the courts with its complaints if these had had no ground at all. One must therefore presuppose that the evil in that time, which had not yet long seen the syphilitic ills arise, had been epidemic; on which the circumstance in that narrative also points: that many showed themselves not at all susceptible, or only under certain conditions, to the entwinement. Those were the healthy ones, and therefore the untouchables; the unhealthy ones, far more frequent than perhaps now, provided a multitude of variations in which chance found a rich field to play its game.

If the evil was then of a nervous kind, it formed connections with other natures, perhaps of an opposite nature; those, once recognized and incorporated into a secret practice, made this side easily vulnerable: so that the evil, through transmission and transference, could easily propagate itself, and this partial possession appeared only as a part of the likewise transmissible general one.

##### iii. The Demonic Bloodlust

Closely akin to the lust of generation, and forming its reverse side, stands the lust of murder opposite it; both awaken a blood-rage, which in the one passes only from the lifeless into life, in the other from life into death. Both can thus cut into the human being in like manner as corrosive forces; both, driven to an extreme, will be capable of polarizing him inwardly; and as now the drives, thus crowded together toward certain poles, grow in their swiftness and energy, they will fight more and more against the dominion of the will; and finally, when the corrosion has advanced to the core, they will entirely withdraw themselves from its power; and as they, in their irresistibility, now drive their body-servant from horror to horror, they at last also bring about the obsession.

What the sexual fury can accomplish in this way, we have just seen; we still have to consider what cruelty can achieve; and after the deeds of Asmodeus have passed before us, we must also turn our attention to him who, among the erotes, called himself Behemoth. Facts that mark the stations of this path lie in abundance in the records of the courts of justice; they are too well known for us to need to enter into them more closely. When in the carriage era a young beautiful woman of good birth, the Countess of Brinvilliers, is seized by such a fury; and now, without any ground of hatred, poisons relatives, friends, and the household staff, and even visits the hospitals to poison the sick: then that otherwise sealed wellspring has opened in her depths; and she has now begun, with that cold, unstoppable fury that seizes the marten when it strangles everything living around it, to murder. \[Page 305\]

The deep physical ground underlying this raging also reveals itself in this: that this evil, once it has emerged decisively in an individual, becomes easily infectious and seizes the masses; as everyone recalls from Roman history, when that epidemic raged among the Roman women; the berserker fury of the North took no other origin. People nowadays are accustomed to classify such things uniformly under the great rubric of madness and derangement; and it cannot be denied that, insofar as every extreme can only arise from a derangement of the usual relations, a derangement indeed lies at its base. But the actions that proceed from such a displacement are not empty deliriums; they are recognized as punishable because they are carried out with full consciousness, leading over into an objective world of their own, to which they belong; a world which, like the one in which they arise, is indeed likewise an extreme one, but which also, like the actors themselves, connects itself with the usual one. Reaching over into the evil order, they also take up influences from it; and as they appear in themselves, through the direction and aim of their activity, to be of a demonic nature; so do they lead from step to step deeper into the demonic world; so that what was at the beginning only an overpowering by the affect becomes at the end an overpowering by the demon. That this is so can already be proven by the case where the attacks, directed against a saint, were led to their goal most swiftly through retribution.

So slays Leopardus the hermit Ehoarn in Brittany in 1024, and is forthwith seized by the evil spirit. For twenty years thereafter he wanders about, naked in winter as in summer. If someone gives him a garment, he does not budge from the spot until he has torn it to shreds. Wool or linen he unravels, fur he tears into small pieces. In this case what happens suddenly and as punishment, hurling him out of his course, in others unfolds gradually; and the raving natural instinct, the natural evil, passes without discernible transition into the ethically demonic evil.

A striking example of this kind of progression, on a path leading swiftly downward, is Gilles de Laval, called de Rais, Marshal of France; who, of noble descent---from the houses of Laval, Roncy, Montmorency, Rais, and Craon---inherited vast estates; increased these still further through marriage with Catherine of Thouars; and thus became one of the richest landowners in the land, distinguishing himself not a little in the wars against the English at that time. At twenty years of age he had succeeded his father, and forthwith began a senseless extravagance. He maintained a guard of 200 men on horseback; a chapel of 25--30 persons; choirboys, musicians, chaplains had to follow him, along with a great number of other servants, everywhere on horseback, and for them, as for others, he always kept open table. Rich silver vessels, costly garments of gold brocade belonged to this chapel; a portable organ had to accompany the procession everywhere; his chaplains were called, as at cathedrals, deans, singers, archdeacons, scholasters, and one among them bore the title of bishop. \[Page 306\]

They were clothed in scarlet with ermine, had rich stipends, and he had several times petitioned the Pope for miters for them. At the same time he had mystery plays performed at great expense, or rather mysteries, as they were called then. He soon found those who fostered and encouraged his lusts in every way; besides many of lower rank, especially Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville. To cover his enormous expenditures, he naturally had to squander his estates below their value; and not one would have remained to him had not his relatives taken the matter in hand, procuring a royal prohibition against selling any further possession, and a prohibition from Parliament against anyone purchasing any. In this predicament he sought help from chemistry, which was to provide him the philosophers' stone; adepts soon appeared to him: quicksilver had already been fixed, but the philosophical egg broke before it could be hatched. He now sought help from the one reputed to be the possessor of all hidden treasures.

Trusted agents of this master also came to him; a physician from Poitou drew his circles in the forest; the Black One, as he said, had passed by him in the shape of a leopard; that he had remained silent was due to a fault in his preparations. He wished to return home to investigate more thoroughly; richly rewarded, he departed and did not return. A Florentine, Francesco Prelati, great alchemist and magician, took his place; and made use of a book from the Marshal's library. Later in prison he confessed how he had several times seen the demon in the shape of a young man of twenty years, who called himself Baron; how once he had given him a black powder with the command to carry it to the Marshal; and how on another occasion he had shown him a quantity of gold bars, which afterward proved to be merely a heap of sand and a yellowish earth. The Marshal on his side had made a contract in his own blood, in which he promised to give the demon everything he demanded of him, except his life and his soul.

He had worshiped him for this purpose, offering him sacrifices, incense, alms, and a feast arranged in his honor; and he sealed all this by immediately offering him, as a token of allegiance, the heart, the hand, the eyes, and the blood of a child. Now an old woman was noticed, who roamed about the country and the heathens, approaching the little children who tended the livestock or ran about begging, and flattering them, while always keeping her face half covered with a heavy cloth. She thus lured them to the castle of Raiz, where they then vanished without a trace. At first it was only peasant children and homeless ones who thus perished; but soon, with growing boldness, the city children too came in turn, even as far as Nantes.

Bodin recounts on p. 249, probably from the records: after the werewolf had in this manner slaughtered eight children for the devil, he at last also promised the ninth, his own, and indeed while still in its mother's womb, to kill it for him as a pleasing sacrifice by opening the same. Yet he did not attain to familiar intercourse with him face to face, and he was wont to say: the Unknown must be a common fellow, that he should shrink from associating with persons of rank. This speech of his, now, the sign of the cross that he perhaps made upon entering the circle; or the prayer that he always spoke, especially his Alma Redemptoris Mater; his attachment to the chapel that surrounded him; the secret resolve that he cherished, to atone in the end by a crusade---these were the reasons that his entourage adduced for why no such relation would come about. \[Page 307\]

Raiz meanwhile surrendered himself to the most shameful lusts that the imagination can possibly conceive; and so had the bloodthirst in him united itself with this lust, that the unhappy victims of his brutality acquired a true charm for him only in the moment of their death, and out of grim lust he continued what he had begun in despair. He himself killed his unhappy victims with his own hand; their cries, their rattling, their convulsions delighted him, as he strove to increase and prolong them, and to enjoy this lust all the more closely, he would seat himself upon the dying ones. In the tower of Chantocé a whole barrel full of calcined bones of children was found, whose number was estimated at forty, all of whom this Moloch had burned in his glowing arms. According to his own confession, the number of those whom he had thus sacrificed there and in the castle of Machecoul amounted to a hundred; others were found in the privies of Suze, likewise in Nantes, Vannes; so that the total number was estimated at 150.

They were all sacrificed to the demons Barron, Orient, Beelzebub, Satan, and Belial, while the office of Easter Day was sung to them. Soon after Easter, when he had anew vowed a journey to the Holy Land, but immediately thereafter in Nantes had again defiled himself with the same abominations; he was at last, on the order of the Duke, together with Prelat and some others, arrested. The accusation was brought by the procurator of the Duke, and the promoter of the Bishop of Nantes; six or seven family fathers, whose children had gone to the Marshal and not returned, were likewise complainants. The trial was conducted in the new tower of Nantes, before the Chancellor of Brittany, the Bishop of the place, and the Inquisitor of the kingdom, Jean Merri, on charges of heresy, sorcery, sodomy, and so forth; but before Peter of l'Hôpital, the President, in regard to all that pertained to his competence. He was at first very bold in confronting these; he said: he would rather be hanged by his neck than give account to the clergy, who were all stained with simony and shameful deeds. He knew the faith as well as they, and he wondered that the President should allow them to meddle in such processes.

He became, however, soon more pliable, and the censors of the church made him confess a part of his shameful deeds; the fear of torture accomplished the rest. He was confronted with Prelati, and the confessions proved Marshal, under tears and sobs, to him: Farewell, Franz, my friend! We shall never see each other again in this world. I beseech God that He may grant you patience and understanding. Be assured that, if you have good patience and hope in God, we shall see each other again in the great joys of Paradise. Pray to God for me, I shall pray for you! On the following day he confessed in public audience all his crimes, and how he had committed an uncountable multitude of other horrors; but he attributed everything to the bad guidance he had received in his youth, which had known no rule but his will and his pleasure.

On the 25th of October 1440 his judgment was read to him, he was thereupon handed over to the confessor; a procession was held for him, that God might grant him patience, and he was then delivered to the flames on the Magdalene meadow; yet, on account of his repentance, he was buried after his death in consecrated ground. \[Page 308\]

Similar horrors have also occurred elsewhere, and especially children have become the victims of such abominations. In Nider's time the rumor went around in the Bernese region that 13 children had disappeared there in a short space of time. The justice authorities therefore became attentive, and one woman, who had been taken into custody on account of her suspiciousness, confessed: how she especially stole unbaptized children, then boiled them until the flesh became like a jelly; from their firmer parts she then prepared her ointments, while the more fluid part served at the initiations, and made those who were received immediately clairvoyant. One man, named Stadelin, from Boltingen, in the territory of Lausanne, confessed: how he had seen children in a house even killed in their mother's womb, so that it always came to abortion.

A woman from Thann, in Alsace, made the following confession to the Sprenger: she had, as a midwife, brought many children into the light of day, then, lifting them into the air, had offered them to the demon; but thereupon had immediately pressed a large needle into their head, from which they then died without the wound bleeding. If the dead ones had then been buried, she had dug them up again at night-time, had them roasted in the oven, thereupon had eaten the flesh, but had preserved the fat for other uses. Her confession amounted to forty children whom she had thus killed. Another one, who once, going out of the city gate, accidentally lost the arm of a child, was thereby discovered; and now confessed that she had murdered children without number in a similar manner.

Joh. Müller of Wellferdingen had, as Remy relates, a one-year-old child, his only joy and consolation. Three women, Agathina of Pittelingen, Anna of Melzingen, and Mageta of Hochit, stole this darling of his from the cradle; brought him to a neighboring high mountain, called the Gyse, kindled a fire there, laid the child on the embers, and burned it to powder. They now gathered the ashes with all diligence, moistened them with the dew from the grass and the ears of grain, and made a dough from it, which they afterwards sprinkled over the vines and fruit trees to destroy them. Bernhard's wife killed, chopped up, and roasted the fruit of her own body, and in the same way other corpses were also burned to ashes; and from the powder a drink was then prepared, which, on account of its bad taste, was still mixed with other plant remedies. Whoever drank of it was doomed to death.

One sees in this procedure that from the burned animal substance a Prussian blue acid developed, which then combined with the potash of the ash, and in the drink, released by additions, immediately acted deadly. In the form of an ointment, the same substance could then also probably become deadly already through mere touch. Thus it had been observed in Gazal in Piedmont that wherever a certain Androgina had entered other people's houses, the inhabitants of the same immediately died. \[Page 309\]

She was arrested, and confessed: how forty of them in number had concluded a conspiracy, and now anointed the door handles to make the inhabitants die. This happened in the year 1536; in Genoa the same occurred in the year 1562. The convent in Yssel in the Netherlands, in which Marie von Sains lived, was full of obsessions and maleficia, but no suspicion had fallen on her; for one held her to be a saint without equal, until she, driven by a secret power, declared herself to be a sorceress, and was now arrested by the official of Tournay. But it still took another year and a half until she finally, in the year 1613, made the more detailed confessions about her misdeeds, which first of all ran thus: that all the maleficia of the convent had really been instigated by her. Then she also made confessions about her murders. She confessed: how she had murdered many children, or disemboweled them alive, in order to sacrifice them to the devil. Others she had strangled, the still-beating hearts of still others she had crushed and eaten with her teeth, especially those born of Christian parents. Many of these children, she said, I have secretly strangled in this city and the neighboring places, and then exhumed the buried ones, and carried them to our nocturnal gatherings. To many I have thus given death, or removed them from the way with poison that the demons supplied to me; others I have pulled the hair from, still others I have pierced the heart or the temple with a needle; which were thrown into the fire oven, others drowned, still others roasted on a spit, boiled in pots, thrown into the latrines, laid on burning pyres, thrown to lions, snakes, and other wild animals for food. Some were hanged by the feet, with the arms or by the neck, others also by the genitals; to some I have smashed the skull against the wall, flayed them and cut them up as if for salting; still others I have placed under presses, tied them to dogs, and thus let them be torn apart; or I have hanged them on the cross to the shame of the Savior, and to all this I then made use of these words: In mockery of the Creator I bring you, Lucifer and Beelzebub, and the whole assembly of demons, the body and soul and every limb of this child as an offering. The Archbishop of Mecheln, who was present at these confessions, declared: In the seventy years of my life I have seen and heard much, since I began to reflect; but nothing have I ever heard or understood that could compare to this; the crimes and abominations of this girl, Maria von Sains, seem to me to go beyond everything that is conceivable.

Before we share in this astonishment, we must first establish the viewpoint under which we have to take up these events; their visible exaggeration gives the closer consideration the invitation. One must assume that the interrogators had the human understanding to have a part of these alleged victims named to them, and then inquired whether they had really died at that time; because otherwise they would have been most grossly deceived by a web of fantastical imaginings. A number of these children had thus been snatched away; the sorceress had taken the instigation to their death upon herself, and the question is, what share in it can really be ascribed to her? \[Page 310\]

Her cloister had the enclosure, and she could reach the deathbeds and graves of these children only through remote action in ecstasy. She had thrown a part of the stolen ones, as she said, to the lions, snakes, and other beasts. But her cloister maintained no menagerie; these beasts therefore belonged to the Sabbath's collection of animals; there, where the toads also go to pasture. There, too, the crosses had been erected, the pyres piled high, and the ovens heated, which formed the apparatus of her atrocities; and there she had blasphemed the Lord, His mother, and other saints who appeared to her to lead her back to a better path, had pelted them with filth, struck them, and even wounded herself.

All this, therefore, had occurred in the vision; she stood then as the members of the Sabbath are wont to do, her back turned to the demon, her head inverted downward; and since the logical order of her concepts had now been turned upside down, her will too must have been entirely perverted; and as the demonic influences entered into this perversion, those monstrous forms were called forth within her. Her will had become bestialized, and now brooded shapes similar to those that a tiger, locked behind iron bars, might behold in its dreams. It was punishable before the inner judge, because it had consented fully to these deeds; and it itself, whatever fate and blind impulse had been at work in the matter, had previously assumed them with good conscience. The deed by which she alone fell to the worldly court was otherwise constituted. To remote action is also added remote vision; and she recognized the nearness to death in the state of those whom she had chosen for her sacrificial victims.

Against them she had directed the intention of her will, in order thereby to wrest the inevitable death---the work of an organic necessity---over into the realm of freedom, and to make it there her own work. Although such influences and intentions, especially in the moment of death when everyone becomes clairvoyant, and thus a corresponding receptivity is joined to them, are by no means entirely indifferent; yet it is in no way to be believed that it succeeded for her according to her intent. For even without taking the ecclesiastical into account, a protection against such attacks must already lie in nature itself; and she will know how to preserve her law against the intrusion of such brazen caprice. She was therefore a criminal in the realm of the spirit, but the visible deed did not fully correspond to the intent; because the power does not expand evenly with the wicked willing, and the execution must therefore always lag behind the design. Not the depth and the extent of the most atrocious doing can therefore claim our wonder here; but rather the frenzy, to which the demonic ecstasy raises and sharpens the slumbering murderous drive in man, will rightly lay claim to our astonishment.

#### C. The Palingenesis of the Demonized Life Toward the Outside

The life that has fallen into those downward-drawing whirlpools experiences changes that it perceives from within, or that also become bodily visible outward. It further enters into a different relation to the life-circles near to it; insofar as it acts upon them destructively, or, according to circumstances, apparently healingly. Finally, new relations also tie themselves between it and certain natural powers, upon which we must cast a glance, just as upon those other transformations.

##### i. The Demonic Metamorphosis

In a life, disrupted in the manner set forth, through demonic influences, a change in the general feeling of life corresponding to the assault it has undergone must also necessarily enter; because it is in the self. \[Page 311\]

It seizes it every time as it finds it. But it finds itself through that influence, among others, also degraded, and brought down from the higher stage which it had previously occupied to a lower one. But man, originally the lord of the animal creation, has, through the Fall, drawn closer to it, become its tyrant; and every further descent will thus take place on this well-trodden path, first into these natural realms standing closest to him, and the sinking man will find himself more and more resembling the natural productions there. But most rapidly and thoroughly, however, is this sinking brought about through those demonic connections; with equal rapidity and in an equally deep plunge will this assimilation also follow; and the common sense, finding the imprinted form within itself, will bring it to intuition. Thus the metamorphosis into animal form, which we encounter in the natural domain as a disease, in the wake of a similar disruption wrought by the forces of nature, will also return here in the demonic realm; as one of the forms in which the demonic influence manifests itself.

To now obtain the distinguishing characteristics of this new form, we must first place before our eyes the facts that pertain to it. Passing over the manifold hearsay, of which there is plenty here as everywhere, and setting aside all impure reports; we hold to two main facts, both of which, but especially the second in sequence, clearly and purely ascertained, are fully sufficient to orient us as to what we should think of the whole matter.

The first factual report is contained in the confession that Peter Bourgot, called the great Peter, and Michael Verdung, made before the inquisitor and the prior Bom in Poligny, in the diocese of Besançon, and before many witnesses in the year 1521, when he was accused of maleficia; which Wier has communicated in extract from the original. Peter testified as follows: how, nineteen years before, at the time of the fair in Poligny, the most violent downpour had so scattered the herd he was tending that he did not know how he should find them again; and how, while searching for the cattle, he met and saw three black riders. The last among these, on being asked what drove him, after he had complained of his distress to him, bade him be of good courage, and promised him: if he would give himself over to him, he would give him a master who would assist him so that henceforth he would suffer no damage to his herd from wolf or any other beast, or from any other source. In confirmation of what was said, he promised him the recovery of all the cattle now lost, and in addition money.

He had accepted the condition, and had said he would present himself at the same place in 4--5 days. Since the cattle had indeed been found, he had also returned to his rider on the third day, who asked him whether he really wished to surrender himself to him. On the question from his side, who then he might be, he had replied: The servant of the great prince of hell; but fear not on that account! They had now concluded an agreement together, renouncing the Christian faith; whereupon he had offered him his left, black, and cold hand to kiss; but he had now knelt before him, and had greeted him---who later called himself Moyse, and forbade him all church attendance---as his lord. \[Page 312\]

This had gone on in such a way for two years, but the art of protecting the cattle had not been imparted to him; only the spirit, as it seemed, had taken care of it for him when wolves perhaps appeared. Soon after being relieved of the care of the herd, he had neglected Moyse, and had again taken part in church services for about 8--9 years; until M. Verdung induced him to renew the pact on the condition that the promised money be procured.

The meeting took place in the evening in Chastel Charlon in the forest; where many others, with blue-burning green candles in their hands, had gathered. One day Berdung, who also had a spirit named Guillemin, spoke to him thus: if he would only believe him, he would bring it about that he might proceed in his running with any desired speed. He allowed this, upon the promise of new monetary payments, and this one then anointed him, after he had stripped himself naked, with an ointment that he had with him; whereupon he immediately believed that he was transformed into a true wolf. It horrified him when he beheld the four wolf's feet and his wolf's hair; but now in his running he was borne along, swift as the wind, and this could only have come to pass through the aid of his master, who was immediately present at such a flight; although he did not see him until after he had regained his human form.

Michael, anointed in like manner, had moved away with equally desired speed, such that the eye could not follow. If this had continued for one or two hours, then, when Michael had anointed himself and him anew, the human form had returned more swiftly than one might have thought; but the ointment both had received from their masters. When, after such a run, he had complained to Michael of exhaustion, scarcely able to hold himself upright; then this one had replied: this was all nothing, and it would soon pass of itself. Once, however, when he had anointed himself according to the other's instructions, he had seized a boy of six or seven years with his teeth, and killed him; but since he had to abandon him on account of the noise and howling, he had run back to his clothes, where through the other herbal ointment he had returned to human form. \[Page 313\]

Michael had accomplished the like, and one day in wolf's form had killed a woman who was putting in peas; but the lord of Chusnée had come upon them, and since they had also attacked him, they had not come to their purpose. Both likewise confessed how they had killed a four-year-old girl and devoured her all but the arm; the flesh had tasted good to Michael, although he had eaten but little; but it had in no wise agreed with his stomach. From another girl they had sucked the blood and devoured the neck; an eight- or nine-year-old child Peter had strangled, because it had earlier denied him alms; and after the deed, immediately at the same spot, he had begged alms for the sake of God. Michael had been transformed into a wolf even when clothed, but Peter only when naked; he also did not know how to say what had become of the hair when he regained human form. He had also run with she-wolves, and that with great lust; sometimes too the time of transformation had passed more swiftly than wished and expected. They added: also an ashen-gray powder had been given to them, with which they had rubbed the left arm and hand; whereby every animal that they touched with it had perished.

The second case has emerged yet more clearly and distinctly. In the year 1603 there was conducted before the Parliament of Bordeaux, under the presidency of the first president Daffis, a jurist then renowned throughout all France for his insight and ability, the trial of such a werewolf-man from Roche Chalais in the land of Guienne; and the records of this well-conducted trial de Lanere has excerpted in his book¹); from which excerpt the following circumstances stand forth as essential. \[Page 314\]

The ordinary judge had conducted the first examination on the spot, in the village of Paulot, upon the rumor: how there on the previous day a wolf had attacked a young girl, Margaretha Poirier; and how a youth of 13--14 years, Jean Grenier, in service with Peter Combaut, had boasted: that he had been the one who attacked her in wolf form, and would have devoured her if she had not driven him off with a stick. The attacked girl was re-examined by three witnesses, and had usually tended the cattle with Grenier. On such occasions, he had often told her: how he, transforming himself into a wolf at will, had already torn apart several dogs and two children; but that dog flesh was not as good to eat as that of children. One day, while they were again with the herd, a wild animal had thrown itself upon her, seizing her by her clothing at the right hip and tearing it; whereupon she had struck at it with her stick. But the animal had then withdrawn 10--12 paces from her, and, setting itself up on its hind legs like a dog, had looked at her with a furious gaze; so that she had run away in full terror. The animal had been thicker and smaller than a wolf, had also had a smaller head, along with brown hair and a small tail. The third witness, Jeanne Gaboriant, 18 years old, reported on various things he had said. When asked why he was now so black, he had replied: that it came from the wolf skin which Pierre Labourant, who lay chained in a mighty chain, had given him, and had told him thereby: if he put it on, he could transform himself into a wolf or any other animal. He had then done this many times, and had run about each time at the waning moon, on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays, but only one hour of the day, toward evening or morning; theirs, however, were nine, of whom he named some who ran with one another. 1) Tableau de la Constance p. 252--326. 470

This seemed sufficient to place the accused in custody; and when examined in it, he confessed voluntarily more than the witnesses had stated. He was the son of the day laborer Peter Grenier, whom he had left three months before because he had beaten him harshly; after which he had wandered about in the area of Courtras partly on beggary, partly in the service of various masters. Once a young man named Peter of the house Tilhaire had found him on the road, and had said to him: in the forest of St. Anton there lives a gentleman who wishes to speak with you. When he had gone with him, they had found him dressed in black, on a black horse; and when they had greeted him, he had dismounted, and had kissed him with a very cold mouth; then commanded him to present himself each time he desired it, and had ridden away. This had happened three years before, when he had been 10--11 years old; and they had seen him three more times thereafter. He had let him groom his horse, had promised him money, and had handed him a glass of wine, after which he had gone his way again. But before that, he had been marked by him with a sort of spit that he carried, under the buttocks; where indeed a small, round, insensitive mark, in the form of a seal, was found on him. He confirmed the statement of Marg. Poirier as completely true, and confessed: how once at the villages of de la Doubla he had gone into a house, and had carried a child in the cradle, which he had found alone, behind a palisade in the garden; had eaten as much of it as he pleased, and had left the rest to a wolf that had been nearby. So he named several others with whom he had proceeded in the same way; but without tearing their clothes, as wolves do, rather pulling them off. He ran at the waning moon, 1--2 hours in the day, and sometimes in the night; but also on church festivals, on the day before Pentecost, in Lent, and especially in Holy Week. \[Page 315\]

The Lord of the Forest would then give him, every time he wished to let him run, the wolf's skin and the ointment, both of which he kept with him; and he would immediately wrap the one around himself, and anoint himself naked with the other. Peter de la Tilhaire likewise possessed such a one, and they had run together four times; without, however, killing anyone together. His father, likewise a runner, had taken him along on the run several times, and they had once together killed and eaten a girl near Grillaut. After the running, he found himself very fatigued, and his hands and feet bloody, torn by thorns and thistles. The nail of his left thumb was thick, long, and claw-like; he had had to let it grow thus at the command of the Lord of the Forest. This one did not let him out of his sight as long as he had the wolf's form; but as soon as he, the accused, lost sight of him, he returned to human form.

He was now handed over to two physicians for examination, and they found him in spirit dull, limited, and ignorant; moreover, of a black-bilious and melancholic temperament; they declared, however, that in their opinion he in no way suffered from the wolf-sickness. At the same time, the fathers of the children whom the accused had named as eaten had also been summoned and confronted with him, and it emerged that they agreed with his depositions with regard to time and place, the form of the werewolf, the wounds, the aid that the relatives had provided, the weapons or sticks that they had carried, the words with which they had shouted at the wolf, down to the smallest details. Once he had selected the tenderest and fattest out of three children, and had recounted how the brother of the father of the three children had driven him off armed, and as he fled, had called after him: je karroumteray bien. \[Page 316\]

The children were presented to the judge; the attacked and wounded one was indeed the plumpest among the three; and Jean Roullier, their father, testified how the brother had truly used those words. They went even further, and had him led through all the villages and houses where he had run, according to his statement; and when in one of them he found the man who had spoken those words, he recognized him at once among many others, and seized him by the arm. Marg. Poirier was also brought forward; he recognized her at once among four or five girls, and she him in turn, and showed the officials and him the wounds at mouth and chin that were not yet fully healed. His father too was heard and confronted with him; the son wavered somewhat in his statements when he saw him, and it was ascertained that misery and imprisonment had made him dull. But after some rest, he stood by his earlier statement against him; which also went to this: that his mother had separated from him because she had once seen him gnaw on dogs' feet and children's hands. The decision of the Parliament was as wise as the conduct of the entire trial was exemplary. The court ruled: the boy, whom the demon had armed against other children, must not be given up as lost; all the more so, since according to the report of the clergy who had taken charge of him, he had already begun to abhor his crime; which was evident in many tears and gave hope of winning him back to God and a better way of life. Considering, however, that he must be removed from the sight of the inhabitants of the villages where he had committed his crimes, and placed in such a situation that on the one hand a nature so neglected and estranged from the fear of God need no longer be feared; on the other hand, however, that it might be enabled to bring him back to better paths, the council has sentenced Jean Grenier: to be locked up for life in a monastery of the city, to be of service to it all that time; and under penalty of death forbidding him ever to remove himself from this place of confinement.

His father and Peter, called Tilhaire, were detained for further investigation, but after a month's term, however, released. There in his monastery, de Lancre visited him later in 1610, and learned from him still much that was significant. He was then a young man, 20--21 years old, of medium height, rather small for his age; he had wild, small, deeply set, black, unruly eyes, whose expression showed that he was ashamed of his former state, of which he had some knowledge, and dared not look anyone in the face. He had very long, light, more than usually broad, somewhat blackened, and damaged and worn teeth from gnawing around with the animals. His nails were long, and some black from the root to the tip, among them also the thumbnail, which the forest lord had forbidden him to cut; and these thus blackened ones were also half worn down, and otherwise still extraordinary, because he had used his hands in the manner of feet. \[Page 317\]

He was somewhat dull-witted, yet not so much that he would have been senseless on that account, and he carried out quickly what the good Carmelites, who had taken charge of him with love, commanded him. He showed little spirit, and struggled with things that required only plain human understanding; like one who had always spent his time with the herds, and seen nothing of the world. He made no secret of the fact that he had been a werewolf, and that he had run across the land on the command of the forest lord; and he only said that this was not shameful to him, since he had ceased to be such. But he also confessed without concealment: that he still felt a great lust within himself to eat the flesh of children; especially that of young girls was a delicacy.

To the question: whether he would perhaps still eat such things, if he were allowed? he answered honestly: Yes. Also the clergy told how they, in the beginning of his stay in the monastery, had sometimes seen him secretly devour the removed entrails of fish. He also once had a wondrous skill in going on all fours, and jumping over ditches like the animals. De Lancre remembered thereby another boy from Saint Pa, who had run as fast as a fleeing dog; knew how to turn around so swiftly that one scarcely noticed it, and sprang over the ditches like a gust of wind. Grenier also assured him: how he had had a wolf skin, which the lord had given him in the forest of Droilha, in the marquisate of FronSac, and which he had hidden on the roof of a barn in his village; yet he had not always brought it to him when he had let him run. His father had likewise made use of it, and on that account, and because he had let him grow up so badly, he expressed great aversion toward him; he also never wanted to see him, although he came to the monastery several times. In contrast, he had a quite special pleasure in seeing wolves, and this affection might well be mutual; since in his interrogations he had often testified: how he had always left the greater part of the prey to the accompanying wolves. His forest lord, moreover, he abhorred and cursed at that time, and said of him: how he had visited him still twice at the beginning of his stay in the monastery, which had frightened him greatly. He had promised him much money if he would serve him again; yet he had soon departed again, because he had more often made the sign of the cross against him; which he also still did now and then, so that he would not return. He died, moreover, still in the same year 1610, at the beginning of November, in a Christian manner under the care of the monastery clergy.

It is here two natures neglected from youth onward, and in shepherd life utterly feralized, who had become werewolves. In the one, and probably also in the other, the wolf nature already lies hidden; the black-bilious temperament inclined toward cruelty, the restriction of all higher mental faculties extending to blunt stupidity, the wild eye, the lust for human flesh, the sympathy with the wolves, and the skill in going on all fours, all point decisively to the predominance of a wildly rampaging, animal disposition; which required only a slight external impulse to turn into the werewolf. But this impulse came, and in that the physicians in the second case were by no means mistaken, not from nature, but from the will; for it is the Lord of the Forest who first brought about the condition. \[Page 318\]

It has arisen from the homage paid to the demon within him; and the one paying homage is turned toward him in servitude through the kiss, which in the first case is given by him, in the other received, and is designated to him as a symbol with the mark. The demon now stands, as the object of his animal seeing, with necessity in his field of vision, and indeed in the form of the black ruler, who sends his herd of werewolves into the land, and whom the one sees unwaveringly before him as long as he remains in the condition; while the other rediscovers him when he has resumed his previous form. As in this way there is a rapport in the senses, so is the werewolf now also, as the servant of the Lord of the Forest, who grooms his horse for him, submissive and bound in will to his own; and he drives him forth to murder, ruin, and child-devouring. But life and life are also placed in rapport with one another in that cold kiss, and thereby it has become possible for the Lord of the Forest to arouse the wolf nature in the servant at any arbitrary time; so that it rises up against human nature, and holds it down during the duration of the condition.

It is thus a demonic, deliberately provoked intercourse that has here opened itself between the two; without thereby excluding the sickly condition that enters simultaneously, in which this state indeed roots physically and vitally. This dual nature of the affection shows itself precisely in this: that while the running, on the one hand as a lunar sickness, occurs in the waning moon and is bound to the time of day; on the other hand, in its demonic nature directed against the ecclesiastical, it also occurs on the eves of festivals and on the festivals themselves. The anointing too, in its effect, conditioned on the one hand by the powers of the substances entering into it, on the other hand by the resolve of the will, shows such a double nature, and thereby links the sickness with malice.

The ointment is twofold: the use of the one unleashes the wolf nature with all its drives, and the anointed one appears to himself in wolf form; the run begins with wild force, other wolves, driven by instinct, join the runner, and share the prey with him. The other binds again the unleashed beast, and the restored human finds himself weary and faint, with bloody extremities once more. But the community with the Lord of the Forest, and the use of the ointment, is a traditional matter. There already exists a fellowship into which the novice is received; an earlier member of it initiates him into it, one in whom the condition has already become habitual, and who therefore scarcely needs the ointment. But they also strangle these werewolves, and there arises the question: whether merely in appearance, or in reality? In the first case, the coincidence of their running with the stranglings has not been legally ascertained; in the second, however, it has been done with care, and the result speaks decisively for this concurrence, which has returned too often for it to be attributed to chance. \[Page 319\]

Grenier ran thus truly, not merely in imagination; this is proven by the black, claw-like nails, the filed-down teeth, the appetite for human flesh even seven years thereafter, when he had long since ceased to run. He also truly attacked the designated children in wolf form; this is attested by the statements of those attacked, and even more by those who came running up, and whom one must assume knew how to distinguish a wolf from a human. The other question will thus be: how to explain the undeniable matter? And here the remote seeing connected with remote acting might offer itself as the nearest explanation; an explanation, however, which is neither justified nor refuted by the records. For to ground it factually, an observation would have to be at hand: where one sees him enter the state, and remaining present as a human in the same place, but at the same time seen elsewhere as a werewolf; such an experience is, however, in no way given here.

It will thus be safer for the present to assume the wolf skin, of which he constantly spoke up to the end, as cooperating therein, even though it was not found. He was of small stature as a youth, and as a boy in his stuntedness probably even more dwarfish; and with his ability to run on all fours, a donned wolf skin might easily have given him the appearance of a wolf; all the more so, since the fury of the attack and the terror of those attacked did not permit too sharp an observation. The manner of this attack, less with the paws than with the teeth; and the shedding of the clothes, which fell off without the undressed ones knowing how it happened to them, do not deny the human who makes use of his hands. There also appear in the process of another werewolf testimonies that one believed to recognize hands and feet, after human fashion, on him.

Corresponding to the outer form was then the inner wolf nature aroused to fury, and it was the demon who made use of this ecstatic raging one, as his instrument for working evil. Thus the acceptance of the facts and the sharp looking here, as everywhere, leads to the track of the true truth; while the unconditional denying deceives itself about it, and the all too great credulity gains only one falsified by error. There lie, however, also other examples at hand, in which the wolf running again coincides with the Sabbath vision. A woman rabid for wolves anoints herself with her ointment on head, neck, armpits, and other limbs, in the presence of the magistrate of her place, who had promised her life if she would perform a proof of her art before him. She falls down, and is seized by a deep sleep. After three hours she awakens suddenly again, stands up, and asks: where she has been in the meantime? She replies: how she, transformed into a wolf, near a city several miles distant from there, first tore apart a sheep and then a cow. Inquiry is now made at that place, and it is learned: that such damage had truly occurred among the herd there. \[Page 320\]

Lerchheimer on his side recounts: I once went with a church servant, my good friend, to the house of a land bailiff, who held a werewolf captive, as such people are called. He had him brought for us, so that we might converse with him and inquire what sort of business it was with these people. The man behaved like a madman, laughed, hopped about, as if he came not from a tower but from a life of ease. Besides much other devilish deception and specter, he confessed: that on Easter night he had been at home with his household in wolf form; which place was more than twenty miles away, and a river between, twice as wide as the Rhine at Cologne. We asked: How did you get over the water? I flew over it. How did you get out of the prison? I pulled my feet out of the stocks, and flew out the window. What didst thou among thine own? I went about and beheld how they lay and slept. Why didst thou return to the prison? I had to, my master would have it so. He praised his master greatly thereafter. When we told him: that was an evil master, he said: Can ye give me a better one, that will I accept. He knew of God as much as a wolf. It was a pitiable thing to behold and hear the man. We begged and obtained it, that he was released; else had he had to burn. God better such courts.

So is it ordered with this distortion of human nature, which in the aforementioned examples is already abominable enough, but reaches the peak of hideousness in that Peter Stumpf, who toward the end of the sixteenth century was executed in Bedburg, in the diocese of Cologne. According to the records, he had consorted with a succubus for more than sixteen years, and from her received as a gift a broad belt, which, when he girded it on, had the effect that he seemed to himself and others to be a wolf. In this shape he had strangled fifteen boys one after another and devoured their brains; moreover, two of his daughters-in-law were attacked by him, that he might make them his prey; while he had taken his own stepmother and daughter as bedfellows. We have just seen, and Boguet confirms it, how examples have also occurred of women who ran as she-wolves; nevertheless it is easily understood that the disposition in the more timorous sex by no means inclines toward that side; and that it therefore prefers animal forms more suited to its nature for its metamorphosis. There the cat first offers itself, this shy, timid, malicious species, which, with glowing eye prowling through the night, from time to time rends the imagination with its hellish song and howls it through; and thus we need not wonder if we encounter this animal form so frequently in witchcraft. \[Page 321\]

Thus at Remy many of those arrested for sorcery unanimously confessed: that, when they had faithfully served the demon for several years, he gave them the power to slip in the shape of cats or also of mice, locusts, etc., through narrow holes into another's house. Arrived there, they then resumed their shape, and carried out what they had purposed; to which also belong deadly assaults, but here exercised on adults by poison, and only on children by open violence; as indeed Barbelina Ragel confessed that in cat shape she had killed a child, seizing it between her paws. Assuming the truth of the fact, there can be as little question here of a real transformation of the body as with the werewolves; the cat nature, which has become dominant in life, also rules in the senses and in self-feeling, so that they see themselves as cats, and accordingly act as cats; but both in seeing and acting, because heightened toward the negative side, they overreach into the distance of space, or also perform the deed only in intention.

So it is, according to the diversity of the need, that other animal forms also come into play, into which the demonized and thereby inwardly depressed human being transports himself: a kind of transmigration of souls, in which the degraded self-consciousness, descending step by step, traverses all the moments of animal creation, which the human being, as lord of this creation, binds and conceals within himself; and which all mingle together, when he, instead of ruling them, allows himself to be ruled by them, awaken in him, and then, reshaping him into their kind, take command within him. The human being can thus, descending in spirit, traverse all these various animal larvae at different times. The bodily aspect will of course remain steadfast in its fixed dominion thereby; but it will, mastered and driven by the animal drive peculiar to the larva, for that very reason also imprint the ruling physiognomy of the same upon itself.

A human being who, in such a manner, has Proteus-like run through all these forms, and mimicked them outwardly, has thereby unbound in them his personality, which was bound in unity downward, so that it has fallen apart into its elements; and thus he himself has become a kind of animal Sabbath, spread out in time, in which all these shapes, held together enduringly in the unity of the personality, press successively upon one another, and pronounce his name in animal hieroglyphs. This visionary metamorphosis remains, in its essence, enclosed within the inner circle of life, because no real metempsychosis, through all animal bodies, exists for the human being. Only individual effusions of the transformed reproductive power sometimes reach the region of the bodily, and now also make themselves known outwardly through unusual, plastic formations. We have seen earlier how certain saints, by a mystical path, have called forth such formations in the heart and elsewhere; here on the dark side the same must occur under certain circumstances. Something of the kind has shown itself, for example, among the possessed of the convent of St. Ursula in Loudun. \[Page 322\]

One of the four spirits of the prioress there had been compelled on 5 November 1635 by Father Surin to throw himself down before the Sacrament and adore it. He then cast her down at the feet of the exorcist; she rolled about there terribly, and clasped his knees several times, while the Magnificat was being sung in the church. Suddenly she stretched out her arms, which then stiffened together at the hands; and thrown upon the altar step, and leaning her head against the feet of the one performing the exorcism, she turned the profile of the latter toward the window for some of those present; and these now saw the figure of a cross upon the forehead, incised into the first and second skin, from which fresh and red blood welled forth. Since the Protestants present said that she could have imprinted this mark upon herself in her convulsions with a concealed iron in the form of a cross, which nevertheless seemed impossible given the stiffening of her arms; a repetition of the act followed later, shaping itself slowly before the eyes of the spectators. For it is stated in the verbal process, recorded on the spot:

On 29 November 1625, when I, J. Deniau, royal councillor at the presidium of La Flèche, and procurator of the commission, attached to the lord state councillor F. Laubardemont in the matter of the exorcisms in the Ursuline church of Loudun, went there with J. Nozat, secretary of that commission; where Father Surin,---whom the most holy Archbishop of Tours had urged in a letter to conduct the exorcism in such a way that it would lead to an edifying result for the English lord Montagu,---earnestly exorcised the prioress of this convent, in the presence of that lord Montagu, and of the lords Killegren and Seandrel, both English gentlemen, as well as several other respected persons. \[Page 323\]

When he now pronounced the exorcism over the kneeling woman, she leaned backward onto her heels; and as she held her left arm, in the sight of all those present, up in the air, we, along with other bystanders---namely, Monsieur de Morans, vicegerent of Monsieur de Poitiers, the Fathers Anginot and Bachelerie of the Society of Jesus, Father Luc, a Capuchin, that English gentleman, Monsieur du Fresne, a citizen of Loudun, and Father Surin---saw, on the upper part of the hand of the aforementioned prioress, bloody letters forming themselves, which combined to form the name Joseph. Therefore, we, the aforementioned procurator of the king, have written down this our verbal process and signed it, and had it signed by those present as testimony to the truth, after the court clerk had read it aloud. Signed: Deniau, J. J. Surin of the Society of Jesus; de Montagu as eyewitness, that he saw the letters of the name Joseph impressed upon the hand; Thomas Killegren. Under the seal is written in English by Monsieur de Montagu: I saw the hand as white as my collar; but suddenly, along the whole vein, the color changed and became red; immediately afterward a clear word appeared, and the word was Joseph.

Montagu soon afterward went to Rome, told the Pope there what he had seen in Loudun and heard from others; then returned to the Church, took holy orders, and from then on lived in France, where he had the reputation of a man of spirit.

The natural side of these appearances emerges purely, it seems, in the case observed by B. Haan. An innocent, pious, twenty-two-year-old woman, of melancholic temperament, was seized in the evening of November 8, 1684, with shortness of breath, and in the night with sleepiness; and in the morning, upon rising, she saw two blue spots in both hands, and from the wrist to the bend of the elbow the arm marked with various cracks; over the elbow, however, inscribed with letters, especially N B, and interspersed with the sign of the cross. The next morning, after she had been at a wedding, she found the number of crosses---longer and shorter, deeper or shallower incised---increased by new ones on the neck, the breast, down to the abdomen; and within seven days the entire skin from the head to the heel was covered with them, and rough to the touch.

The face had at first remained untouched, but in the end it too was marked, though only lightly. On November 11, she had moaned in her sleep and wrung her hands; she had therefore been awakened, and needles were found thrust into both hands; which later played a role in various visions, along with an old woman who demanded them from her and struck her. Later, other needles had to be pulled from the soles of her feet, and on November 16 she was found outside her bed under a bench. In between, then, in the third, fourth, sixth, and tenth nights, new crosses were impressed upon her, then the signs of the planets, their aspects, and those of the simplest chemical preparations, all of which she knew well and with which she was accustomed to occupy herself for her instruction. The affliction diminished gradually until January 21, 1635; only that, as she was sewing at her neighbor's on that day, on the right a cloverleaf, on the left a trefoil, with the year 1635 lightly but clearly depicted, appeared. On both, the year showed a heart pierced with arrows, and beside it the image of a fool, with the inscription: Fool! On February 9 she had another violent but short-lived crisis, and then recovered completely. \[Page 324\]

Although people attributed the evil to an old sorceress, to whom they had given a dress, without, however, seeing any sufficient grounds for the suspicion; yet if nature is capable of so much, then one must not be surprised if something similar happens in the highest crisis of the obsession, at the departure of the spirits.

##### ii. The Demonized Life as Poison and Antidote Torment

Just as in the times of earlier paganism all belief was naturalistic, so too was all mysticism a natural mysticism and magic. Just as one did not know how to separate the concrete and yet universal deity from her work, and to reconnect it again in the right way; so too did one not know how to separate natural evil from ethical evil with all sharpness; rather, corroding the one through the other, one accepted both in the same way as natural products. Thereby the opposition of good and evil was again thrown into confusion and obscurity, and instead of attaching it as such to God and the fallen creature, one rather divided it halfway under God and the nature mingled with him.

Thus one had to regard the good and the evil affection as alternating states of one and the same being; and by letting them, say, in periodic alternation, emerge at different times from it, the gods of antiquity were alternately good and evil, mild and wild, appeased and enraged, striking and raising up, killing and enlivening, confusing and clarifying. Those who now in a mystical way held themselves in the nearness of these gods, the retinue of Odin for example, and of Hulda, were imitations, formed after the manner of the model; it was the wild host and the mild; riding through the air, it now disturbed the cheerfulness of the sky into wild storm, and calmed the uproar again, so that serene stillness returned; it struck down the harvests and withered the vine, and made them green again, fed and watered with the harvest blessing; it sent the arrows of plagues into the lands, and healed again helpfully the damage to the land.

This lasted a long time over into the times of Christianity, until it succeeded in correcting the ideas of the masses. Therefore, for a long time still, in those who deviated from the paths of ordinary life, this intermittent character of their state was acknowledged; those sorceresses, into whom the old Feyen, Allrunen, and Drudens had passed over, are called, depending on whether they turn one side or the other forward, now Huldas, now the Unholdas, now good mothers, but again rascal wives. Only with the progress of time, as the good separates itself more sharply from the evil, is this intermittence also abolished; as the one orders itself exclusively upward, but the evil falls to the depths. Now at last the concept of the Unholdas becomes the prevailing one for these, as such who hold no one dear, but are hostile and born enemies of God, of men, and of all God's creatures; and they now become, in the full sense of the word, harlots and harlot-masters, black artists, poison brewers, cloak riders, goat riders, weather makers, night hoses and night wanderers; and again night women, mist bears, specter women, shimmer birds, devil's concubines, human thieves, etc., all in the far prevailing character of the evil side.

Meanwhile nature enters into all these states, and nature does not depart from its kind. But this kind is always, because in it all extremes touch each other, giving forward and returning, oscillating back and forth from one extreme to the other. Continuously through the whole duration of the evil, those who were seized by it have, precisely because it unbound unusual natural forces in them, felt compelled, according to circumstances sometimes to make a salutary use of them. Remy tells of a remarkable example thereof. \[Page 325\]

When the child of one of his friends, the rentmaster Blankenstein of Dampmartin, had run away from his mother in the church and was passing the time with play; an old woman passed by him, stroked his head caressingly with her hand, wishing him all good things, and then went on her way. At once the child lowered his head, and his piteous weeping showed how it fared with him. As the weakness of the little one, whom they had carried home, kept increasing, the people judged that it came from the old woman, who had long stood in ill repute. The neighbors therefore pressed upon her that she should go and make the child healthy again. She was willing, and as soon as she came into his vicinity, she began to fall ill in the same manner as he himself. Her mouth turned blue, and a foam appeared before it; so that those present were horrified by it, and believed nothing else than that she would become rabid.

Since night had fallen in the meantime, she insisted absolutely on remaining in bed with the child; once she laid her outstretched arms upon it, held her mouth to his, as if she wished to drive back the faltering breath. The women who had kept watch at the bed through the night reported: how a humming like that of a hornet had been heard around the child for a while. The boy, whom they had given up for lost, was fresh and healthy the next morning; but most of the livestock in the house fell ill in his stead.

That the illness had begun with the woman's touch, that it had then passed back from the child onto her, and that the child had found himself healthy after some magnetic manipulations, are three facts whose coincidence can scarcely be ascribed to chance. She was thus, like an old Allrune, a night-woman and hunt-woman at once; like that one in Blois, who, in order to heal an enchanted person, had a mass of the Holy Ghost read at midnight in Notre Dame des Arbres; then laid herself full length upon the sick one, and murmured some words thereto, whereupon the sick one became healthy at once.² In all these healings there appears a natural force at work, which strengthens itself through mystical addition; but sometimes also, when present in rich endowment, reaches development on the mere path of nature; and then forms that class of doctors called by birth, who from time to time arise, and, after they have practiced a doing bordering on the miraculous, are either suppressed by the guild-members and the police, or, with waning power, gradually sink back into obscurity.

Of this sort was, for example, that Valentine Greatrakes, who, born around 1628, from a respectable house in Ireland, served for a time in the army; but around the year 1662 heard a voice in an inner admonition which told him: that he too could heal scrofula by his touch, like the Queen of England. At first he was laughed at by those to whom he communicated this summons; yet he boldly attempted the thing, and it succeeded. For a time he confined himself to this ailment; but soon the voice admonished him: to try himself also on the ague, which then raged epidemically. \[Page 326\]

When he now laid his hand upon a woman and added a formula, the fever departed at once, and the woman recovered. Now he expanded the circle of his practice, countless testimonies of the efficacy of his laying on of hands spread his fame. People began to call him the Antichrist of the doctors; sick persons of every kind spared no expense to reach him; while he, contenting himself with fulfilling the duties of human love, turned away every other reward from his hand. Besides the healing of scrofula, leprosy, and fevers, he restored sight and hearing, and gave paralyzed limbs back their vital force.

He laid his hands on the epileptic, and their convulsions immediately ceased; the movements of the fever stopped at once; sensation and activity were restored, and the illness was forever lifted. On a single day, the hands were laid upon as many as sixty persons at once. An eyewitness reports: several among these sick ones had been afflicted with the falling sickness, and some among these, seized by their ailment, had lain in the same room; he had been called to their aid, and he, leaving other patients, had hastened to them. While the afflicted ones now lay foaming at the mouth and rolling on the ground, he had struck them on the chest with his hand, and immediately their attack had ceased, and they had risen, saying that they felt very well. His procedure was very simple: at times he rubbed the afflicted limb, at times he spat upon it; he placed his fingers in the ear of the deaf, and they became hearing.

At times he also made use of repulsive means for the restoration. But, unlike his superstitious contemporaries, he employed no magical remedies or special words; rather, he spoke only a sort of short ejaculatory prayer before the manipulation, and once the healing had occurred, he then reminded the patient to give glory to God. His warmest admirers attributed the miraculous power to a peculiar temperament of his organism, from which a sort of beneficent influence streamed forth. He himself, especially in the consciousness of the time when he had acquired the gift and of the effects that followed, sought it in a power that dwelt in his hands.

Before he possessed it, he had namely noticed that, when he had severe headaches, the laying on of hands was utterly ineffective; afterward, when he had gained the power, he needed only to bring his hand to his head, and he was healed. Of other patients he was wont to say: their ailment jumped and fled from place to place, just as he changed the position of his hands, until it was finally driven out. Even the laying on of his gloves was not ineffective, though by no means so with other items of his clothing.

Countless testimonies from the healed, from physicians and persons of higher rank, attested to this healing power of his; but he experienced what all earlier and later ones have experienced: envy and jealousy arose against the man who would perform miracles, after---as they said---the time of miracles had long passed; the tongue denied the eye, the rubbing had been the sole effective palliative. Others took up his defense; men argued and grew heated, controversial writings flew back and forth; the death of the miracle-worker finally put an end to the dispute, and the customary care was taken that he should be forgotten as soon as possible. \[Page 327\]

If now such a disposition is present in those who have turned to the reverse side, or if it is called forth by magical practice, then the healing effect will appear only as the counterpart of the harmful one, which steps forth as the dominant force, and the other subordinates itself only to its service. For the healing of a sick person out of mere goodwill is entirely contrary to the principle of the work. Therefore, according to judicial statements, it is the rule that no one is healed without a more severe illness having been transferred to another; so that in the end there may always remain a gain for evil. This transfer must thereby take place each time to the better and the more important: from the woman to the man, from the older to a younger one, from the body to the soul; if the magician wishes to proceed otherwise, then he himself comes into danger.

All this can hardly have always held true in the practice of ignorant people; but it is the simple consequence of the principle: that, while God permits one evil in order that a great good may be attained, evil, on the other hand, removes a small evil in order to bring about a greater one. Therefore, it is also regarded as a law in this sphere: that only an illness inflicted by magic can likewise be lifted by magic, and indeed by the one who wrought it.

Around the year 1208, it was customary in Scotland for such afflicted persons to send for Elspeth Rule in order to seek healing from her. When she once refused to come, the sick man begged his kin to compel her by force. When she finally came and prayed to the Lord that He might restore health to the invalid, he nevertheless died on that same day, though only after he had laid the blame for his death at her head. Another had sent for his sister-in-law several times without success; he now went to her himself, declaring that he would have her burned if he did not regain his health.

From that point on, he took a turn for the worse day by day, through her devilry, in his recovery; so great was the trust in these, albeit uncanny, healing powers, which, moreover, were exercised, as with Greatrakes, through the gaze, through laying on of hands and touching, through spitting, water and salt, and so forth. Sometimes the illnesses were merely suspended and, as it were, lulled to sleep, only to be awakened again at another time; but in transferring them, the evil would sometimes wander through an entire sequence of animals and people until it was extinguished.

Thus could poisons, in popular belief, sometimes become heroically potent medicines; but their proper nature was to bring sickness and death, not healing and life. The sorcerer and the sorceress were like the Bohon Upas; whoever came within the tree's reach, or whom sleep overtook in its shadow, had breathed in death and ruin. This was the general belief throughout earlier times across all of Europe. Beigis Tod's death, the Scottish records relate, cast a severe and unknown illness upon Alexander Fairlie, who forthwith wasted away in violent sweats and an unceasing burning around his heart. \[Page 328\]

This illness lasted fully two months, so that despair took hold regarding his life. Nightly, Beigis appeared to him in her own form, whereupon he would cry out for help each time; by day, however, she came to him in the shape of a dog and drove him out of his senses. A woman had threatened an English soldier quartered with her: that evil would befall him; he fell ill at once and sweated himself to death in one or two days. While Margareth Craigie was recovering, Christian Marwik passed her hand over the woman's breast, and she died that same night. Madness in particular was transmitted in this manner. Jean Craig laid the evil upon Beatrix Sandilands, and she became mad and sleepless, and through this madness of hers was ultimately robbed of her life. Christian Wilson had threatened: a certain man should never again haul stones, and he forthwith fell into madness and rage, took to his bed, and never rose again, but died in a few days. During his illness, he cried out incessantly: that Christian stood ever before him in the form of a gray cat.

Similar things occur in great numbers in the witch trials of all countries, and one stands amazed at them: that locally and temporally in the peoples the most excitable moods have arisen, that individuals have frequently been made irritable to stimuli which otherwise would pass by without visible effect; and that the general belief in the overwhelming power of magic has served here as the medium through which it has struck into the diseased personality. The malice of those individuals who dispense the diseases then armed their own inner corruption with the externality of the elaborates of the poison cloths; those which on the Sabbath cultivated the spiritual side of that poison brewing, whose natural side is carried on in earthly apothecaries.

The idea underlying this has expressed itself in the most pregnant form in those confessions where it is said: when the Sabbath comes to an end, the demon throws himself into a flame that blazes there, burns to ash in it, and this forms the main constituent of the poisons that come from there. The principle is: the natural poison is only the physical semblance-shell of the ethically evil; the ash of the body which this has assumed will therefore be the poison mother, which is penetrated by its inner essence just as the relics of the saints glow in the aftershine of their higher spirituality. In another way, it is the toads of the Sabbath that have to supply this primal poison. They are whipped, seized between the teeth and lacerated, with spiders and snakes, and according to the statement of the Necato, with the seed, marrow, and bark of the bush called Suhandurra in Basque, in Gascony also Herenbaum, and given with the father-murderers when drowning them in the sack, combined, now stamped and also perhaps burned, where then the most potently effective magical poison forms itself, which in the incineration attaches itself to the blood-acid then developed as its carrier. One kind is thick like a salve, the other liquid.

The first is used for the ruin of hated persons, the other is sprinkled over plants and grain. A green water is likewise prepared there, which brings death already at the mere touch, and therefore makes necessary from the side of those who use it an antidote for hand-washing.¹ Another armament of the evil will one has believed to find in the magical plastic. An image is formed of wax or another substance, baptized in the name of Beelzebub, and now pierced with needles or roasted in the fire; everything done to it shall then propagate itself to the archetype. \[Page 329\]

That is already ancient practice, the legend of the death of Meleager rests upon it, and Ovid in the verses on Medea *Devovet absentes, simulacraque cerea fingit,* *Et miserum tenues in jecur urget acus,* has described the whole procedure. One knows what Boethius in the XIth book of his Scottish history tells of King Duffo and his sorceress wives; especially, however, at the time of the popes in Avignon the thing went very much in vogue, and John XXII, who believed that this plastic was directed against his person, issued his well-known bull against it.

From this time and connected with it is therefore also an act of the Inquisition of Carcassonne from the year 1328, in which in the process of the Carmelite Petrus Recordi the judgment states: Because thou at different times successively hast made and uttered many and manifold invocations and callings upon the demon; because thou hast fashioned images and mixed manifold poisons into them, also drawn the blood of a toad in a fearful and terrible manner, poured it into them, and now hast thrown thyself down before a table, covered with a cloth or carpet, sprinkling their belly with blood from thy nose mixed with spittle, in the intention of thereby bringing an offering to the devil.

Because you buried those images, wrought in such a manner and in other ways not to be mentioned here, secretly under the door-sill of certain women whom you sought to gain for unchastity, as indeed succeeded with three among them, and would likewise have succeeded with two others if your order had not transferred you to another place. Because, after you had known these women and indulged in lust with them, you again removed the aforementioned images and threw them into the river; and then offered to the devil as a sacrifice a papillon (a gold coin of that time, according to Du Cange), and sensed its nearness through a wind or in some other manner; believing that the images had the power to compel the aforementioned women to your love, or, if they would not consent, to torment them through the demons. Because, after you once struck one of these images on the belly, blood flowed, etc.

One sees that this is a matter here of a love-spell that was to be tied to these images, and whose reversal then turns into a death-spell. Especially the Byzantine history is rich in precedents of this sort, and the French history also knows some to recount, particularly in the time of the religious wars. The exorcists cite similar ones; Sprenger has recorded some,¹ likewise the physician Zacutus.² All these cases, however, are not so purely investigated, and presented roundly and clearly with the exclusion of all deception, that one could found upon them any reliable judgment whatsoever. The image is to be a kind of mirror that collects the malevolent intention as in a focal point, and then directs it upon the object represented itself in full perniciousness and conveys it over. The fundamental idea is thus that of an apparatus in which the demonic influences unite; something like how the magnetic baquet was supposed to concentrate and further conduct the somnambulistic influences. But as this led on a well-trodden path to all sorts of charlatanry, so too was the way paved through these demonic condensers to every kind of fraud and self-deception.

##### iii. Relations of Magically Aroused Life to the Natural Forces

\[Page 330\]

Witchcraft has at all times claimed a dominion over the powers of nature, and we have already seen within what limitations these its pretensions find justification. The natural sphere, governed by physical law, and the spiritual sphere, standing under the psychical, are separated from one another, and both find mediation only through the organic. Within this mediation, the energy of the spiritual grants to the natural only a limited influence, which in turn, on its side, is secured against the all-too-disturbing encroachments of the spiritual through its massiveness; the measure of reciprocal influence is thus bounded by the mediating organic. In the meantime, it has been believed, especially that the air-sphere, this earth-encompassing ocean of a volatile, mobile element open to all impressions and equalizing all, yields itself most readily to such influences from the spiritual side; and thus at all times has ascribed to magically heightened life a disturbing influence upon the atmosphere.

This belief came particularly to light at the end of the sixteenth century in a process that became famous; at that time, when the insipidly pedantic James of Scotland had been drawn, by a band of ecstatic women under the leadership of a schoolmaster, into a heroic drama in the enchanted forest, and now personally conducted the investigation of this wondrous affair himself. In a fit of romance, he had sailed across to Norway in the year 1590 with a fleet to fetch his queen himself.

On the homeward voyage, while the whole fleet sailed along in favorable winds, his ship alone encountered headwinds, so that it made only laborious progress forward; moreover, a boat carrying jewels for the queen went under in the storm between Leith and Kinghorn. This was now all the work of those women, as was discovered after the king's return. Geillis Duncan, who served at Bailie Seaton's, had for some time been performing various healings that aroused her master's suspicion, until at last he had the thumbscrews applied to her, whereupon she confessed that the cures had been accomplished by the devil's help, and now named many others as accomplices and witches. Thus: Agnes Sampson, the eldest of them all; Agnes Thompson of Edinburgh, the wife of George Mott; Barbara Napier; and Euphemia MacCalzean, the daughter of the Lord of Cliftonhall, one of the members of the justice college; many other women were likewise named by her, and also men, among them especially Doctor Fian, otherwise called John Cunningham, schoolmaster of Saltpans in Lothian, who among the others was regarded as the devil's secretary.

All were arrested, but Agnes Sampson was first brought before the king in Holyrood House. She denied everything at the outset, but was tortured, and now confessed such strange and wondrous things that James himself declared her a liar. She replied, however, that it would not be good if His Majesty did not believe her words; she therefore offered to communicate things to him that would dispel every doubt in him. She now took the king a little aside and told him all the words that had passed between him and the queen in their wedding night in Oslo in Norway, with all the answers that one had made to the other; so that His Majesty was highly astonished, and swore by the living God that all the devils in hell could not have invented the like, so deeply was it grounded in truth; from then on he believed her statements. \[Page 331\]

She now related how the whole fellowship had resolved to raise a destructive storm on the sea against the king on that voyage. Satan had first wanted to let a fog arise, so that his ship would strand on the English coast; but since that did not seem sure to succeed, Fian, the schoolmaster, wrote to Marion Linkup, a famous witch, and to the others of the sisterhood, and summoned them all to meet at sea with their master within five days, in order to destroy the king in common. On the eve of All Saints' Day they assembled, some four hundred persons strong, at the appointed place, and each embarked in a sieve, merry and in good spirits. After some cruising about, Satan appeared and gave a cat to Robert Grierson; with the cry "Hola!" it was to be thrown into the sea, and the desired storm would then follow. Even earlier, six witches had bought such a cat in the weaver's house; two had seized the iron hook of the hearth, the animal had then been pulled three times through the ring of the hook, and driven three times under the hearth. To its four legs had then been bound main limbs of men, and when it was thrown into the sea after midnight, the storm had come there too, which had swallowed that boat.

When the sieve-farers had completed their business, they landed at the church of North Berwick in Lothian, first drank wine from their sieves, and then, more than a hundred in number, went two by two to the church to observe the Sabbath. Geillis Duncan danced ahead and sang to the harp the lay:

> Commer, goe ye before, Commer, goe fe\
> Cit she will not goe before, Commer, lei me.

Fian acted as master of ceremonies in the church, opened the doors and lit the lights, while Gray Meill served as doorkeeper. The demon appeared as preacher; his body was hard as iron, as it seemed to those who touched him; his face terrible, his nose like the beak of an eagle, claws on hands and feet like a griffin, his eyes gray and burning, his voice hollow. He delivered an exhortation to those present to henceforth carry out all evil, after which the homage followed in the usual manner.

The king had Geillis Duncan brought forward; her testimony agreed most perfectly with what Sampson had said, whom Spottiswoode describes as a worthy and truthful matron in her statements. She had to play that lay on the harp for him; the king, who was present at all the interrogations, marveled at the agreement of the testimonies, which also remained consistent in the confessions of Fian and all those who were present; and even now sets all English reviewers in wonder, that they declare it the most insoluble problem in the philosophy of Scottish history (sic). One sees that a conspiracy against the king had taken place; he, it seems, of whom Bothwell, later himself accused of witchcraft, was not entirely unconnected. But it was a mystical conspiracy, carried out in the magical manner of the cult, and the demon was to play the principal role in it as weather-maker. \[Page 332\]

The drama therefore played itself out in vision, and the bond in which the conspirators were united gave their testimonies that agreement in the circumstances; while their clairvoyance knew of the king's doings. But the visions, moving in the spiritual realm, and the baptized cat had broken against the sluggishness of the elementary sphere; the king's ship, it seems, had sailed into a local wind current, and the whole undertaking was thwarted. The courts had turned the entire heavy apparatus of the tangibly real realm against the ideal world of the mystical conspiracy; and that they sought to grasp the airy shadows with tongs and levers brings precisely the baroque, ironically mocking strangeness into this affair. They had, moreover, just as much ground and no-ground to hold the matter for true as the earlier inquisitors; for that the Protestant liturgy had been inserted into the visions could change little. Their judgment pronounced: Fian should be strangled and burned, the same fate was assigned to Agnes Sampson. Euphemia Maccalzean, a woman of great resolve and ungovernable passion, who was accused of manifold poisonings, like the Brinvilliers in France, was likewise bound to a stake and burned to ashes.

In Remy's Praxis in Lorraine, such complaints of storm-raising and weather-making likewise occurred frequently; but mostly the damage inflicted reduced itself to a few tiles thrown down from the roof; whereby it never lacked excuses why it did not come to greater mischief. Yet there also occur testimonies in him that lead on the track of how it went with that weather-making. More than two hundred persons confessed judicially, namely, how at certain times the witches gathered in hordes at a body of water or lake, preferably where one lies in a desolate and unvisited place.

Having now arrived there, they struck for so long with rods, which they received from the spirit, into the water, until a thick vapor and mist rose up from it. In this they then led themselves upward into the heights; where immediately the vapor condensed into black clouds, in which they rode back and forth with the spirits, and finally came down again with hail and under claps of thunder. J. Carmé of Gerbeweil and Jana Oberta testified: that it had not been a dream to them, but that they had seen it with their own eyes: how an incredible number from their coven rode back and forth in such conjured clouds, faster than the storm wind, as when sparks shoot in thick smoke, and came down again and they vanished. Meanwhile, it had thundered around them and crackled terribly. Aleria said: how she had shot over J. Vehrt as he was tending the horses, and the spirit, at her urging, from the heights above, had struck two of his steeds dead with lightning. In the mountains, especially those of primary formation, lakes of a peculiar kind are no rarity; not of great extent, but of unfathomable depth, hence dark-colored from the water.

They must be fissures that fill them, which have been rent through the mountains deep into the interior of the earth. The interplay of the subterranean forces in the abyss, and of the atmospheric ones above in the heights, is thus mediated through the body of water contained in them; so that the fountains of the deep still stand in connection here with the cataracts of the heavens. Such localities must therefore be nodal points of atmospheric changes, which develop from here out of the counterplay of the forces; the local weather will appear tied to them, and in summertime the mountain storms will most gladly brew themselves in the mists of these lakes. The folk sense has long recognized this, and its legend ties much to such localities. \[Page 333\]

One knows what Pausanias reports of the well on the Lykaeus, which was the weather lake for Arcadia. "In the diocese of Girona," recounts Gervase of Tilbury already in the year 1212, "rises the mountain Cavogum, today called Canigou; its peak is steep, and toward many sides unclimbable. Upon it stands a lake with blackish water, unfathomable. There, according to the legend, is the house of the demons, a vast palace with closed doors, yet castle and inhabitants are alike invisible. If someone throws a stone or some other solid thing into the lake, there arises, in the anger of these demons, immediately a storm. It is certain that in these mountains there is eternal turmoil of warring winds, and seldom or never stillness and calm." The same legend goes of the Mummelsee in the Black Forest; if one throws one or more stones into it, the clearest sky clouds over, and a thunderstorm arises, with hailstones and storm winds. The same is reported of many other such lakes, and they are therefore probably also called Nixie wells by the folk. One now comprehends what significance they have in witchcraft, in which the natural forces active around them prove themselves of particular influence.

These women have, like all the sick, especially those in the nervous system, the calendar in their limbs, which makes them particularly excitable to every change, especially electrical ones, in the air. Their intentions are in any case directed toward those lordly heights; if now a storm should brew over those lakes, then an electrical local nexus forms above them, from which and to which all the electrical currents of the surrounding area flow. The intentions, already aroused, therefore find in them the paths laid open, upon which they, drawn concentrically to that same center, begin the journey that leads them to the hearth of the incipient atmospheric change. The Sabbath is thus now a weather Sabbath, and is held over those lakes. With rising electrical tension, the lords rise in the fog that is lifting itself; as the lightnings shoot and zigzag through one another, so do they traverse the thickening clouds; and finally, at the slackening of the tension, they return to earth in the weather-ray and the thunderbolts: All in vision, but laid into the natural uprising itself. As weather prophets, they have sensed the impending evil in the realm of the meteors beforehand: their sympathy has risen and fallen with its development; it is no wonder that they have the full conviction that they have brought it about and caused it.

Section IV. The Witches Trial
-----------------------------

The difference of the sexes, which, in all occurrences of ordinary life, has its pervasive significance down to the deepest root, is in the upward-directed mysticism, in relation to God, entirely without meaning. The ray of His grace shines over mountains as into valleys, and no distinction is to be noted other than the one He Himself makes in His choice. But the inner human relation is by no means thereby destroyed and annulled; it continues to exist in everything that belongs to the human in that relation, thus in the preparation for the reception of that ray, in its inner processing, and in the emission of the received into life. In all this, the difference of the sexes shows itself: in that the man therein acts more as the self-standing unity, the woman as the nurturing, nourishing multiplicity; the former thus in a kind of imitative substitution as the deputy, the appropriator, and the re-emitter of the received grace, and hence again as the steward, householder, leader, and enlightener in the earthly household; but the latter more as the nurse taken up by the ray of the instilled, also in the emitting forever clothing it; thus, therefore, opposite the first, appearing as the preserver, collector, and light-sucker. \[Page 334\]

It will be otherwise in the downward-directed mysticism, where creature stands opposite creature; and thus there is no talk of any incommensurable relation between incomparable magnitudes. There the night can deceitfully clothe itself in the light of day; the relation that exists between the sexes can thus also be transferred to the relation that exists between the demon and them; and this transfer expresses itself in a physical formula, that one can as incubus or as succubus offer itself to the one near it. Here, therefore, a relation of the man to evil is conceivable, in which he is permitted as the lord, but this as the ruled subordinates itself to him; whereas the woman everywhere is permitted to community only in the relation of subordination. The man, set in such wise in a positive relation to the demon, is it even so much more in relation to the woman; he is its representative against it, and therefore consistently steps forth in the role of the seducer in the midst of the seduced. For precisely as such a one he gives forth from his unity what this one, seemingly imparting, yet in truth receives from the first unity of all evil.

Also, emanating from him, it can affect many receivers, who thus peripherally, as seduced ones, surround him, their center. Hence the circumstance that, like the incubi more frequent than the Succubi; so also more sorceresses are to be found than sorcerers, and that therefore the title of the *Hexenprozeß* \[Witch Trial\] can fittingly encompass the entire method of interrogation of the witch courts. The phenomenon of sorcery, as we have now come to know it in its extent, considered as a doctrine, is without the slightest doubt the most abominable false teaching into which the human spirit can lose itself.

This spirit, which, just as the body of nature feels itself beneath itself, above itself, around itself, and within itself, so perceives the Divinity at the beginning, at the end, at all its boundaries, and in its entire substance, and just as it has come to self-consciousness from Him, so too can it preserve itself only in Him alone, in such a way that the mere thinking away of Him in it arouses the vertigo of death; this spirit, therefore, grounded and dependent, here enters not merely with its purely personal basis, but with the absolute basis of all that has become, into the most sacrilegious contradiction. It does not fortify itself, by holding onto its inner vital breath, in that dizzying, suicidal thinking away of its inmost vital basis; since in atheism, by turning its spiritual freedom against God, it in truth turns it against itself, and through its doubt does not seek to abolish Him in itself; but rather, as much as possible, denies itself in Him, and thus withdraws itself from His service. \[Page 335\]

It does not, like one form of pantheism, allow God to dissolve in His work, thus perhaps in boundless pride in itself; nor does it resolve, like the other, to dissolve itself in Him, in order in equal pride to find itself in Him as God, and thus by its own power to transubstantiate the created substance into the uncreated, or vice versa. Rather, it allows God to subsist in His essence, and now rises up in its own, which it owes to Him alone, in a senseless revolt against Him. For this purpose, it now arms everything within itself that entered into it in the times of that first, hoary rebellion, and that, damped and built over by later formations, boils beneath in the depths; and it devotes its higher and better nature to ignominious servitude to this. Well aware of the impotence and powerlessness with which this pact is concluded,

it looks around for other allies in the invisible realms; and now allies itself with the even older revolt that shook the first-created spirit realms; seeking, by breaking through the bounds of nature, to raise up the scum that these rebellious realms, in consequence of the igniting conflict, have cast out into its dark abodes; not in order to participate in the, albeit insane, hopes of a still undecided battle, but in the despair of defeat. And if such a teaching were still to confine itself to the purely theoretical domains, one could regard it as a spiritual eclipse, through an overwhelming stiffening power, as a kind of intellectual tetanus. But now it also breaks into the ethical domains, and in them too, in the same reversal, turning the highest to the lowest down to their deepest basis.

Through artificial precipitation, the implanted center of gravity is detached from its natural basis and bound to those unnatural ones; and all morality loses in this turning its original validity. It sets itself in the most decided contradiction to the divine order, and seeks, through the death of all life, not to thrust itself out into nothingness in an opposing act of creation, as in atheism; but to force itself into a negative existence which in everything is the counterpart of the positive; and just as the latter bears the absolute positing in its bosom, so this encloses the absolute abolition of the posited, and a positing of the unposited and the unlawful within itself. \[Page 336\]

Therefore, every virtue in it is transformed into its opposite vice, not merely disguised, but thoroughly metamorphosed from within; and the entire will, with full impetus, is not directed toward its goal, but strives away from it toward its antithesis. Hence all its movements become hostile toward the spiritual world-law, crossing it, erring and confusing it, and filling its entire sphere of action with uproar and hatred. Hence the grim bloodlust, which ignites itself with enmity against all that lives, yet in the blood again intoxicates itself in boundless lust, and begins a new fantastical creation in this rapture; which it then endeavors, in the daemonic counterforce, to activate from its mere potentiality, to integrate from its impotence, and to realize enduringly from its shadowy non-existence. Finally, the evil is a plague, overturning all the foundations of life, and inverting everything that rests upon this foundation; shaking and disrupting all bodily existence, perverting the forces in constant excess, boiling all milder secretions into poison, and expelling what is thus prepared in a vaporous sphere, which then envelops far and wide the wellspring from which it has arisen, entwines everything that approaches it, and draws it over into the same perdition. Such is the nature of this evil, which in its full perniciousness has arisen in the midst of civil and religious society, and soon challenges the entire vital force within them to counteraction. Order has thus armed itself against this lethal disturbance; let us see how it has held in the struggle, and first consider how it has equipped itself for the conflict.

### Chapter 1. The Preconditions of Judicial Investigation.

#### A. Historical Foundation of Legal Procedure

The great ethical influence, as we have seen in the history of its development, has not been lacking in any age; but it enters history, as is the case with all cosmic diseases, as the great secular epidemic, whose generation occurred in the first Fall, and whose stages of age are measured by those century-long recurrences. In more recent times it has ignited, especially in the frictions that arose between Orient and Occident in the Crusades; and from then on we see it, in the escort of great epidemics of the spirit that have likewise assumed the form of secular heresies, and in the train of organic pestilences that march ahead as lictors and executioners and form the rearguard, traversing Europe.

The Manichaeism that flared up almost simultaneously with mighty power was destined to become the medium in which it could take root and communicate itself to the masses. If this doctrine, which spread quickly over the South and had already begun to migrate northward with rapidity, had carried off the victory; then its hierarchy would easily have provided the external framework in which the spiritual, esoteric hierarchy of magic could have united itself around the secret service. But Providence then awakened in Innocent III, and in the two great founders of orders, Francis and Dominic, the men who possessed the strength to withstand the dangers of the time. The false doctrine was attacked and defeated in the Albigensian Wars in its great arsenal, and the two orders were destined to cultivate and guard the field won from it. The right of the priest to be judge in matters of faith---a right that attaches itself to that great judicial act which, after the Fall, God Himself held with the guilty, and which from the beginning the Church has exercised in the individual case for itself, and in the general case in councils---was now delegated to special courts of inquisition, and entrusted to the two orders, chiefly to the one founded by the holy Dominic. \[Page 337\]

As the theocracy already had its own knighthood in the Templars for the war against the Mohammedans; so now, from the Holy See, a so-called Militia of Christ was established for it against the heretics, marked with the cross, and enjoying the same indulgences; laying aside the vows of obedience, of poverty, and of conjugal chastity, equally ready for the spiritual as for the knightly strife at their own expense; in the latter placing themselves at the disposal of the Inquisition, and thereby forming, as it were, its armed family, just as the actual familiars formed its ministerial retainers; but later, when disarmed, with an altered constitution, they were joined to the Order of Preachers in the order of the Tertiaries.

The institution spread from France to the Spanish and Italian peninsula, thus to the entire Romance South, to East and West India, and in individual ramifications also to the Germanic North. Through it the terrible heresy was utterly eradicated, which, had it, through the mediation of the Spanish Jews, allied itself with the African Mohammedans (as it has already been accused of attempting such a thing), would have seized mastery over the entire part of the world; and after the victory achieved, it immediately expelled the Jews and the remnants of the Moors from Spain. From then on it watched over the preservation of the purity of the doctrine; hence the tribunal in matters of witchcraft also belonged to it, and for France a parliamentary act of the year 1282, drawn up at the instigation of the Archbishop of Paris, decided: the cognizance in matters of witchcraft should remain with the clergy, to the exclusion of the laity.

At the end of the thirteenth century, the Christian theocracy, shielded by German emperors and having ruled Europe for half a millennium, was overthrown, because the popes could no longer agree with their protector lords. Its great outer fortress against the East, the well-formed fiefdom in the Holy Land, was lost in the great battle that devoured the flower of the two knightly orders, around the middle of the century; until the beginning of the fourteenth, all the bulwarks of this fortress were lost except for Cyprus. The disgrace was deeply felt throughout Christendom, the prestige of the popes was severely damaged, the attack on Boniface VIII became possible, and the high priests had to wander over into the eighty-year captivity of their new protector lord France, for their share in the guilt of all. Their knighthood, the Templars, were the companions of their misfortune.

The order, in contact with all the vices of the Orient, was eaten away to the core by the plague. As bankers and moneychangers between East and West, and entangled in the administration of all lands, it had itself become exceedingly rich through constant contact with gold, but had also thereby degenerated in many ways. Thus as priests it was hateful to the emancipating powers, and at the same time, in its degeneration, to all the more serious confessors of the old doctrine; as a powerful, war-hardened nobility, closely bound to its retainers, it was a stumbling block and a terror to the encroaching princely power; as a guild of rich bankers, an object of envy to the emerging financiers of the modern age, and, on the presupposition of overly vast treasures, also of greed. To them, therefore, was chiefly ascribed the cause of the bitter loss, and the general indignation discharged itself chiefly upon their heads. \[Page 338\]

Nogaret, the instigator of the attack in Anagni, and Marigny, the finance minister of Philip the Fair, took over the prosecution; the trial was conducted before the Inquisition of the Dominicans and other monastic orders: for it concerned apostasy and sorcery, and for the first time the world beheld the tragic spectacle of such a process carried out on a grand scale. The indictment was specified more closely: the renunciation of Christianity through thrice spitting on the crucifix during the initiations; the worship of Baphomet with the glowing eyes; the homage paid to him by the initiates entirely in the forms of the Sabbath; the vow of sodomy and the mutual surrender of the brethren pledged to one another: all standing types of witchcraft.

Torture extracted uniform confessions: of the appearance of the speaking cat, to which worship was rendered; of the demons who presented themselves in female form, and of whom always one would join with a brother; of child-eating and the like. That a trial against the Order could be founded on such accusations rested on the general opinion that existed of its corruption. The confessions, wrung out under torture, will serve as proof to no reasonable person. The proceedings at the reception may have been based on ancient symbols whose key the Order itself no longer possessed. On the other hand, we must accept the conscience of the judges, of the Pope, and of the Council of Vienne as the guarantee: that the matter was by no means entirely without foundation, and that such things were practiced by individual members of the Order, perhaps by individual lodges.

The Grand Master and those who died with him by fire recanted in the decisive moment what they had earlier confessed; and we cannot deny belief to them also for their persons. They died, therefore, innocent enough with regard to themselves, but in that solidary liability from which the members of every great corporation cannot escape. What had been violent in the conduct of the affair was punished in the interpretation of the chorus in history, in public opinion, by this: that Pope and King, on the summons of the Grand Master, had to appear within forty days and one year before the higher judgment seat; but of the subordinate instruments, Marigny and other finance officials, accused of the same vice, had to atone for their crimes on the gallows of Montfaucon. \[Page 339\]

The entire act, however, with all its forms and appurtenances, and in all these influences and aftereffects, is a portent and a prototype of by far the most subsequent witchcraft trials. The theocracy was now broken, the federal relationship in which all European peoples had stood was dissolved; those who had previously been partial members rose to full independence, and the territorial power worked its way forth in the midst of the nations to full sovereignty. In the transition from the abandoned form into the new one there now arose a time of wild struggles, of unbound forces wrestling with one another, which in France mark the rule of the Valois. Sorcery played its role therein as an instrument in the hands of the powerful, and Robert of Artois sought to destroy Philip VI and his queen thereby. Since in such a manner the heads of states found themselves entangled in the affair, it could not please them in the new order of things that those involved should seek their right before an ecclesiastical court. Thus the administration of justice in such matters, which an earlier parliamentary decree had assigned to these courts, was by another in the year 1390 taken from them again and granted to the secular courts; whereby the king's procurator was made it his duty to conduct the inquiries. Thus jurisdiction was given into the hands of the jurists, who from then on exercised it, to be sure with subsidiary involvement of the clergy.

The matter itself now took its course; Charles VI considered himself bewitched; it became the custom at the courts to keep necromancers, like dwarfs and court jesters; to whom, in turn, when the lord could no longer protect them, process was made. The Maid of Orleans had to pay with her life to the English for the undertaking of having saved her fatherland; because pride could not convince itself that she had done it by any other path than that of sorcery.

When the Duke of Guyenne, the brother of Louis XI, had been poisoned, not without his knowledge; the Duke of Burgundy accused the king of fratricide by poison, malefice, loose laying, and invocations of the devil in an open manifesto. An ordinance of 1490 now sharpens for all justice officials the judicial pursuit of all kinds of sorcery; assigns to the accuser the fourth part of the punishment, and commands: to hand over the clergy who might be implicated in the accusation to the court of the bishop. In England the same course of things. Queen Joan is arrested in 1417 for sorcery.

The Duchess of Gloucester, accused of sorcery against Henry VI, must do penance, but her accused agents are hanged. Richard III complains in his council that the queen has made his arm entirely withered. In the war of the houses of York and Lancaster the two parties mutually accuse each other of sorcery. Soon Pope Innocent VIII issues his bull (1484), in which he gives the inquisitors Sprenger and Institoris power, in the whole Rhine region, to proceed against sorcerers and witches, to convict them, and then to punish them. For a time thereby, in those regions and higher northward, the investigation came into the hands of the clergy; but the soon-breaking-out Protestantism brought it back, more or less exclusively, into the hands of secular authorities, and the process form soon established itself in fixed manner.

#### B. A threefold problem for the physicians, the jurists, and the theologians.

\[Page 340\]

It is a grave matter to set oneself up as judge in God's place, and to pass judgment over human beings accused of a crime that in part withdraws from visibility, and reaches deeply into an invisible world. The eye of the judge does not look into the past, as does the eye of God; the roots of the crimes go back into that night which envelops the human horizon, while all their branches grow through the real world, and threaten society in its innermost being. As therefore the deeds to be judged belong to two worlds, so also will their investigation go twofold in two directions; and it will be indispensable to fulfill relevant preliminary conditions thereto, before it begins its work with a good conscience.

Thereon therefore we must first expatiate. The evil is, as we have seen, first of all a plague, a holy or rather unholy disease in its higher root; in its bodily extension, however, a pathological affection, running its course in determinate stages, and developing itself in its crises. It must therefore first of all be considered from this viewpoint, and that will be the affair of the physicians. Every disease has its symptoms, and these are, insofar as everything deviating from the ordinary course of nature appears something wondrous, in themselves wondrous; a character which, in this evil that stands on the boundary of two worlds and stirs both together, necessarily stands out sharply. The first question therefore arises: to what extent can such transcendental symptoms count as proofs for the intervention of higher powers? To answer this question, therefore, nature would have to be sharply circumscribed within its boundaries, and this boundary-determination of it brought to clear intuition.

Even the organic life, and even more so the deeper spiritual life, are set at the boundary of this world and the beyond; it is in any case the medium of passage for all higher marvels; what now does it add of its own? What does it contribute from its altered relation to the surrounding and indwelling nature? The limitation must therefore not be merely in general, but specifically determined against the two natures; so that the thus liberated, fully rounded and self-enclosed conscious being, would be in a position to precisely determine its relations to the two spheres; in order, after it has also separated out its own contribution, to determine the measure of daemonic influences.

It is indeed true that the concrete manifestation of all spiritual substances makes such a determination not impossible; but what progress have we made in the six centuries in which such investigations were urgently demanded? How could one have expected the physicians of earlier times to undertake the solution of such a task? A further question, demanded by its resolution, was: what kind of organic disease lies at the foundation here? Of possession one knew: a power stronger than that of man has taken hold of him; from its objective side it has enmeshed him, and now holds him, as if woven about with a web, captive in its net; so that he, an object of the highest pity, has claim upon the help of his fellow men. It must now above all be determined: does not the incubus rest in its natural ground likewise upon such a natural evil, which only later passes over into the ethical realm? Has not perhaps that evil, which possession has exchanged, and among the organic realms and the forces active in them, merely chosen another hearth for itself? \[Page 341\]

Possession is a disease that does not shrink from stepping forth into the bright light of day; the sleeplessness invariably connected with it even keeps the shadowing of organic night far from it. Could not the incubus, most frequently seizing women, be a nocturnal disease, bound to sleep in the same way as the former to wakefulness? Could not man under certain circumstances free himself from the envelopment of this sleep, and now seeing in the darkness, illuminate it with his own eye-light, as the beasts of the night, breaking through the natural sleep, swarm through the darkness like living natural dreams? The state in which those women who rode to the Sabbath found themselves was very well known to the physicians; they knew that a deep, stone-hard sleep held them fast, and that it lay upon the sleepers like an incubus. How now, were not the occurrences of the Sabbath perhaps the deliria of this ephialtic evil, and was the damage to the land that went forth from the sick perhaps the effect of the insalubrious atmosphere that surrounded them? Such considerations would without doubt have led to the precise knowledge and sharp distinction of animal magnetism, and vindicated for nature a great part of the domain which, owing to ignorance of its power and to the incomprehensible ambiguity of the phenomena, theology had to occupy.

But great discoveries are, in the course of things hitherto, not the matter of deliberate reflection; but favors of a higher power sparingly granted to different times. They were not granted to the physicians in those times, and so the confusion remained for the spirits. The wondrous phantasmagoria that characterized all the births of evil had to pass over immediately to the imagination, and designate this as one of the hearths in which it had firmly seated itself. This investigation too was the affair of the physicians and naturalists.

Was not a pathological condition conceivable, which seized the afflicted, like the corresponding drives in nymphomania, and now poured itself out into a luxuriant plastic form, which, drawing all higher drives down to itself, transformed the inner man without their own doing; much like in certain illnesses through exanthema and secondary formations the organism undergoes a transformation? This must then lead over to the investigation of the role that the imagination assumes in human affairs. It is the mythical faculty in man; myth, in the ordinary sense, grasped as the living plastic of the spirit.

This power had already prevailed in earlier times before the Christian era; the blocks which it had then shaped lay openly in the folk belief everywhere. Whole chunks were visibly mingled also in the witchcraft belief; a part of them indeed hung together with the theological element of this belief; but a part was also visibly agglomerated through that imagination of the plastic masses. Above all, therefore, thought must be given to the separation of these elements, so that here too the legend in man might be separated from history; and not, by rashly misconstruing, punish as wicked malice what belongs solely to the poetry in man. \[Page 342\]

But scarcely anyone has thought of such a distinction; very comprehensible, because all these domains still lay confusedly intermingled, and one had in general become too accustomed to identifying the rogue in man straightaway with the demon, and to attributing to this latter all too often, without distinction, the earlier bold extravagance. So innocent were the first inquisitors of Germany, Sprenger and Institoris, that they took the mocking folk legend of the phallus nest in full earnest, and recount it with a concerned expression in the Malleus. If what is truly characteristic of the evil is held to be the voluntary assumption, so that it thereby falls under culpability and responsibility. It is the business of the jurists and of those who occupy themselves with the ethical nature of man to ascertain the measure of this culpability, and to weigh the punishment accordingly.

But the measure of guilt will be all the less, the more of the illness there is in the evil, and vice versa. One does not deny, although one by no means holds it to be absolutely necessary, that a culpability preceded the ordinary possession; and yet one regards this itself as a misfortune which by no means falls under punishment. Could it not be, just as here the illness in certain cases followed upon the guilt as a punishment, that conversely in witchcraft the evil often first came in the train of the illness? All crimes that are committed at the sabbath follow upon the sleep-like condition, in which the vision of the sabbath itself first dawns. If so, then the investigators must say to themselves: must not the first of these visions also have arisen from a similar state of stupor, so that here too the night was first, out of whose darkness their light then first developed.

In waking, our I hovers freely over its will, and exercises its arbitrariness according to its well-being; full responsibility therefore weighs upon us for all our actions. In sleep this will rests, like a bow that has been unstrung; but he who should string it can scarcely recollect himself. Would it now be the nature of illness that lower organic powers, or natural powers, or even spiritual ones within it gained the upper hand, and now entered vicariously, and from below upward, imitating, strung the slackened sinew; would in such a case a responsibility be imputable to man? The will is in ordinary life well guarded, so that with sound senses such an abuse cannot be perpetrated with it.

But how the likewise well-preserved spirit may yet come to madness; so it also seems impossible that a sleepwalker, in his unconscious nighttime activity of reality, should ever commit a murder: would one be justified in demanding the spilled blood from his hands? The actual crime that ought to be punished in these monsters is this: that they have gathered around the demon, and entering into his service, have thereby surrendered themselves to him as organs through which he can break into the natural reality of things, which would otherwise remain closed to him. But the actual culprit of the first order will then be the leader of these instruments; the courts, however, cannot reach him; they must therefore hold to the instruments themselves, the culprits of the second order. \[Page 343\]

The manner in which the demon has come to these organs may now, however, be a varied one. They may have surrendered themselves to him with full consciousness, in all sobriety; that will, according to the nature of the matter, occur as the rarest case; and those who find themselves in it will without doubt be the most punishable, and the full severity of the law strikes them with complete justification. But the master may also have seduced them to himself through cunning, he may have pressed and stolen them; he may have bought them into his serfdom, or taken them over as an inheritance from conscienceless ancestors. That establishes certain degrees of guilt, which one must also allow to stand where one has recognized them; but who would want to distinguish and bring them to light in all cases? The slave-works that are produced in this factory are now again of varied kinds. Some are entirely of an idealistic nature, and confine themselves within the mystical circle that the fellowship fills. Their investigation and punishment then belongs before the forum of the inner judge; and God above all has judgment to hold over them. Or they have broken forth beyond this circle, and have paved their way to reality.

Then, however, they have either again remained confined within the domain of the human will, and with the best intention of carrying out their purpose, the power to do so has yet been lacking for the willing. Then those who have thus been inclined and willed evil, without actually being evildoers, belong before the judgment seat of the church. Or the mystically arisen, in the will carried evil, has also been born into the light in its execution; then it is indeed the tribunal of the state to which the jurisdiction belongs. The decision will be subject to no difficulty: if the physical has been injured with physical means, as in actual poison-brewings. But otherwise, if the means of execution show a metaphysical character; if not the enveloping, but the invisible enveloped has actively worked.

If free confession occurs, then after due investigation of the fact the decision is again without difficulty. But if denial enters in, then the civil judge finds himself at once driven into a domain in which he is utterly blind and without path or guidance, helplessly lost. Every fact is as it were a living creature, equipped with body and soul; and the soul is as in rapture, and stands in no speech with him; it only points mutely to a world in which he is a stranger, and his mandate extinguished. As the crimes root in the darkness of the secret, so witnesses, means of proof, and everything alike vanish into the transcendent; the procedure at once loses all firm ground; in the unknown world the litigator no longer knows his way, and falls into helpless confusion. The question of the forum was therefore likewise above all to be investigated in full sharpness by the jurists. Further, a knowledge of the statistics and history of crimes on a grand scale was to be expected of them. \[Page 344\]

Whole centuries were oppressed by the fear of the general spread of this greatest of all crimes; and if this fear indeed abated at intervals, and the light-hearted blood sought to vent itself through mockery, then the panic terror emerged with increased intensity now here and then again at another place, and oppressed the minds all the more strongly. But now crimes, although it is their peculiar nature to recognize no law, yet have a law of necessity to which they cannot but submit. All such crimes, as country plagues, have certain carriers and focal points to which they attach themselves; in which they first, as it were, embodied themselves, and through which they broke into society, and now in it again seek to propagate and sustain themselves in gangs.

The number of such carriers is for each crime measured, weighed, and counted, and this measure is conditioned by the state of health of society; the intensity of the evil in its initial impact and its agglomerating effect is likewise determined thereby. This constant figure is of course, according to times and places, capable of increase and decrease; but given the constitution of human nature, oscillating between malignancy and benignity, yet in its changes confined within certain limits. The magistrates and courts are now placed at a point where they can recognize these figures and limits, if only approximately.

If therefore crimes in the common opinion multiply beyond all measure outward, they will not easily lend credence to the startled anxiety, and allow themselves to be biased in their judgment thereby. But if the number has truly and undeniably increased, then they will recognize in the evil the character of an endemic or epidemic social disease; and will be more inclined to derive the overrunning of the contagion from the increasing contagiousness and disposition of the infected, than from the augmented number of the contagiously actually culpable. Then, however, the office of the judge divides into a twofold: one conclusive, directed against the herd of the contagion, and one protective and preservative for those exposed to the contagion; which then leads us over to these, since it may not easily be accomplished without the clergy. For it has namely fallen to the theologians, above all, to instruct the judges and the physicians concerning the degree of influence that the demon can gain over human nature.

What power does he possess by nature, what has he acquired for himself in addition, and on what can he, over against the Christian church, lay claim? These are questions whose discussion must precede every accusation of alliance with him. The first witchcraft trial is, after the first Fall, brought and decided before the judgment seat of God. The first-created tribal heads of the race had passed by the well of the water of life, and had drunk from the magic well. The dragon had beguiled them with cunning, and they had concluded the alliance of servitude with him.

The woman had first believed him: that, where she ate, she would become clairvoyant, and like the Elohim in discerning good and evil; powerful over both, and therefore by no means obligated to death. Thus, in eating at the table of the Sabbath of its fruit, she had committed an outrage against the Lord, and brought the husband to the same deed through partaking with her. Now God, the all-discerner, sits in judgment, and the inquisition begins. The accused are summoned; they are themselves the witnesses of their guilt, for since they have become clairvoyant, their fear and their shame must loudly proclaim that they have now taken evil into themselves. \[Page 345\]

The man shifts the blame onto the woman, this one onto the dragon; to him, as the first instigator, the judgment is therefore pronounced first of all. The curse strikes him amid all the animals; he shall not stand upright, but shall wallow on his belly and eat dust all the days of his life. To the bond that he has knotted with the woman, the enmity between his seed and hers shall set itself in opposition. The heel, the outermost part of the one, is given over to him; but she, in return, shall trample his innermost and highest. To the woman is imposed the toil and the pain of childbirth, and she is given into subjection to the man; to this one, however, a toilsome life on the earth made thorny for him, until he returns to her from whom he was taken.

Thus was the judgment held, as only God could hold it, with complete insight into the matter at hand; the punishments, however, not like ones casually alighting on the individual, but springing from the offense itself; hence also not confining themselves to the individual, but inhering in the whole race. It had wholly fallen prey to death, which was awarded in common to all the condemned; and indeed it was not merely the bodily death, but also the spiritual one that was consigned to it; namely, the fall and the reprobation, of which the former is only a sign full of meaning. After the times had run their course, a second judgment was held. Because to the seducing spirit, in a contemplative beholding of the present, there also belongs a will that is similarly firm, constant, and unchangeable; thus the fall and reprobation were irrevocably fixed for him. But because to the seduced ones, united in body and soul, there inhabits a discursive mode of thinking, and thus also a will that is mobile in like manner; therefore history was allotted to them for expiation, under favorable assistance. In its unfolding, the enmity set between the seed of the woman and the seed of the dragon worked its effect; the blood purified itself in the one race to the degree that it poisoned itself in the other; for this separation was the task of the ancient time.

The chosen people had therefore separated itself from the other peoples; in it, pride and hypocrisy again drove to the left, just as humility and piety tended to the right. With the latter stood God; the other side was the dragon's side; but they believed in him more than in God, because they took his illusory image for the image of God. When at last the opposites had come to their simplest expression, when on the one side God had hidden himself in the Incarnation, on the other the dragon had disguised himself in possession; then the hour of judgment had arrived. But this time it appeared as if not the true God were going to judge over the evil one and his followers, but the reverse; the evil one had summoned the tribunal, his followers sat on the judges' seats, and it seemed as though the reprobate were to pronounce judgment over the one who reproved. The blind ones judged: it was not they, but He who had allied himself with Beelzebub, and, as a sorcerer, had wrought signs and wonders through his power. \[Page 346\]

They therefore condemned him to death, and thus the auto-da-fé was held on Golgotha. Hell rejoiced; the gray bonds of the left had triumphed over the fellowship of the covenant on the right; the ancient prophecy had been brought to shame: for the seed of the dragon had crushed the head of the seed of the woman, since the slayer of the serpent had himself been entwined and slain by the serpent's own coils. Then the wonders of providence suddenly became manifest. Sin, brought forth through the misuse of freedom and stepping in between God and the creature, had also split soul and body apart within it, and thus carried death into them.

The restoration could only take place by God, through union with the creature preserved in the same temptation, casting out the divisive sin, and that creature now going with freedom into death, thereby atoning for and expelling the sin that had intruded between body and soul. The moment of death, which Hell in its judgment pronounced over the victim, was therefore the instant of its defeat; the wounded heel had only brought about the physical death, but the resurrection shattered the dragon's head; the prophecy was fulfilled, the spiritual death was averted for all who held to the Victor. But the act was also exemplary, enclosing within itself the whole history and its future; therefore in this resurrection was also prefigured the destruction of physical death at the end of the atoning history and the restoration of all things.

The serpent-treader thus stands ever since upon the head of the dragon; the stone upon which his church is built has been rolled away from him; the center and core of his power has been taken from him, only the outwardly deeper, as it were the animal element, has remained to him; and he still convulsively entwines with the coils of this broken nature the stone, in order to help complete the historical expiation. This the theologians above all must now consider: that the Inquisition, in which human judgment sat as deputy for God to pass sentence upon attempts at the restoration of ancient covenant fellowship, imaged forth the judgment of God in the beginning; and not that in which the children of the world under their prince pronounced their sentence over the leader of the children of God. The demon no longer has the power as formerly to entangle an entire race, so that only a flood could wipe out the magnitude of the corruption. He no longer has the might to infect entire peoples, so that other peoples must be mustered against them to ward off the pestilence. For the church with all its institutions of salvation stands opposed to him, as protection and shield for its own; it is stronger than he, and his host is bound by its own.

Only those who renounce it; individuals who venture beyond its gentle boundary, can henceforth become his covenant allies. Thus the talk of the witchcraft companions, who had grown in their hordes like the sand by the sea, must have been exaggerated; and the tales of countless child-murders they had committed must rest upon illusion or falsehood. Trois Echelles, who long played the jester at the court of Charles IX but was executed in 1571 on the Greveplatz, had made his confessions before the king, his marshals, and Admiral Coligny concerning the Sabbath, his dances, his poison kitchen, and his unchastity, and how he performed his arts with the help of a spirit. \[Page 347\]

To gain pardon, he had named his accomplices and the signs by which they might be recognized. In the investigation many of those thus designated were found. Some said there had been 1,200 of them; others reported 3,000 were discovered; still others claimed the companions numbered 20,000, more than 100,000, even 300,000. The negligence of the judges, it was complained, had so multiplied the number into the immeasurable, that a greater multitude---then whores and whoremongers---filled the Christian world. One sees how the panic terror, rising from stage to stage, heaped these figures of unchristian fears one upon another.

If we consider the arrangement of the household in the physical nature, then we see there an analogue of the demonic in the bewildering, harmony-disturbing, immoderate-acting, violent forces that from time to time, perhaps under foreign influence, arise and seem to break loose from the laws of nature, and now produce great anomalies in the otherwise tranquil course of nature.

But immediately the healing power of nature also steps forth; it overspins the disturbing forces, levels and smooths out the inequalities, and the old harmony is soon restored again. This proves, first, the superiority of the preserving forces, and that those which are from evil appear subordinated to them; for which reason the lawlessness of the disorderly is dominated by the law of order, and thereby likewise acquires its legality. It is no different with the moral world, where the freedom of spirits complicates the relations; but where the rage of the disturbing forces, in the long run, can accomplish nothing against the quiet resistance of the good, and still less against its active manifestation.

In both worlds, therefore, the masses of forces on both sides are unequally distributed, and those of the preserving necessarily preponderate; precisely because the world appears set upon continuance. Should it now be otherwise in the realm of grace, since the antediluvian times that have passed away? Should God in them be weaker than the demon? Should the gift from above find in the good that lies in man a less willing reception, than the seduction that wells up from below finds prepared for itself in evil? To drive evil up to its outermost peak of negation, as it is found among the initiates of the magical realm, there is required a genius in perversity, such as belongs to all good things in order to form a mystical saint; for the mere allowing free play to the wicked or to the good nature in them will by no means lead to the goal.

But genius of every kind is the affair only of the few; and it stands not to be believed that the black outweighs the white, and that there are incomparably more devil-worshippers and possessed than friends of God and saints; the middle between both will then be filled with the ordinary crowd, bad and good alike. Men have felt this at all times, and have explained the mass of increasing evil to themselves through the approach of the last times; where the impending downfall must be ushered in through such an increase. But this opinion has proved itself premature after the passage of so many centuries; and the judges were not authorized to proceed upon this presupposition. Finally, as the mystical life of the saints rests upon the foundation of the simple moral, plain good conduct in ordinary life, and what emerges here is only repeated upon a higher stage; so will this demonic abomination likewise present itself, only as a deeper stage of depravity, of the region of a vicious life, within the bounds of the commonplace. \[Page 348\]

For he who wills the true freedom of his will seeks it either in the source-like freedom, which has also originally granted its own to the personal will, and thereby unites him with this his source in God. Or he seeks it, in contradiction to it, in his self-will; and now inclines, in necessary gravity, toward the source-point of all negation, toward the demon. Already in ordinary life, therefore, there enters a continuity of the earthly good with the heavenly and superheavenly, and a correspondence of all the bad with the subearthly and the infernal; and to the covenant that is lived with God, there lives another opposed to it with the demon.

Now in this twofold covenant there is a double manner of execution: either the union takes place preferentially in the theoretical will, or in the practical, outwardly effective one. In the first case, the union with God goes toward the purification of the individual in itself, that with the demon toward the strengthening of the false self-will in its negation. In the other, it is the active, outwardly effective will that on the one side experiences purification and strengthening toward the good, on the other side defilement and energy toward the evil.

In the latter case, his actions are the affair of the political society, which experiences their influence in their consequences, and honors them through recognition if they tend toward the good, or wards them off through repression if they are directed toward evil. In the other case, what he has accomplished within the confines of his earthly home is not the affair of the political society, which by no means has the power to intrude into this his fortress; but solely that of the church, which on the negative side exercises its jurisdiction in the confessional. Now, if there exists a state in man, the mystical one, in which these pacts close more tightly because he is placed in a relation, as it were between death and life, and can intervene more deeply into the super- and sub-sensual; then these distinctions will persist in him.

The mystic who has turned himself toward God will, above all, have strengthened, purified, and expanded his inner contemplative life, and through this then also his outer, active one, under the conditions of that first; but the opposite will occur in those who have directed themselves toward the other side. Here too, therefore, the distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric must above all be sharply maintained; only the latter modalities belong before the tribunal of the state, which must leave the others to the church. Over the sabbath and all its abominations, therefore, the criminal courts have no judgments to pronounce; no more than they accept divorce suits on the basis of incubus and succubus. Such things belong to the sphere of action of the church, which on its part by no means interrogates its confessional mirror with the torture. \[Page 349\]

To it also belongs, insofar as it is feasible, the decision: whether the evil lying in man, in the given case, suffices to explain the fact; or whether an explicit pact with the objective evil was required for it. In these matters, one has truly not failed to make inquiries; but we do not see that in the course of the occurrences the full importance of these preliminary questions and investigations was recognized, and that one came to a clear resolution through their answers. One must, however, remember that we, who have surveyed the incidents and experiences of so many centuries, stand in an entirely different relation to the question than those who, at the beginning devoid of all this practical insight, suddenly saw a work, as if rising and growing forth from the ground of hell, before them. The world seemed threatened by this birth of the abyss; it was as if a chasm had opened in the midst of society, which, by vomiting forth the glowing lava of a horror-covered, subterranean depth, threatened to grow into a volcano that would undermine the whole society and draw it down to itself.

To ward off the evil, if there was still time, the courts were dispatched; they could not preface their protective work with those investigations which, so it seemed, had to emerge as results from their own inquiries. It was easy to speak of the improbability that so many were involved in the affair as deliberate criminals; since the memory of the Manichaean heresy still lived in everyone's recollection. At that time, one could also deem it improbable that many people would confess to such fundamentally perverse, absurd doctrines; and yet hundreds of thousands had adhered to them, and it had nearly come to pass that they gained the upper hand. One had countless voluntary confessions, not extorted by torments, and these revealed the great spread of the evil. That certainly pointed to a pestilential contagion; but rabies is likewise a disease---should one therefore allow it to spread and spare the dogs because they are not guilty of their misfortune?

This dissemination, which, as has been found, did not merely encompass many individuals in their spatial coexistence; but also extended itself hereditarily from generation to generation, was so deeply rooted in the general folk belief: that entire places were found whose inhabitants, having become of one mind, abandoned their dwellings and betook themselves elsewhere; for no other reason than because the authorities could not bring themselves to engage with this kind of crime. The people also considered themselves entitled to self-help in such cases, as indeed in Laon two such accused persons, whom the court had condemned to be swept to dust, were stoned; allegedly to avert the wrath of God from themselves.

This imposed upon the judges the obligation to attend to the matter with all seriousness, and to combat the ruin in its germ; lest it burst into flames over the entire ancient order. Lambert Danäus relates: in some regions, probably Savoyard, the audacity and fury had gone so far that several of the accused openly and without concealment before all the world proclaimed that, if they could once obtain a great man as their leader, they would then be numerous and strong enough that, assembled around him, they might venture an open war against any king, and that they might hope, with the aid of their art, to carry off victory over him as easily as the Huns once did over Sigebert the Frankish king through sorcery, as may be found in Gregory of Tours. :) This probably spoke the despair from them over the persecution they endured; but one sees how they felt themselves, and how the courts stood toward them in the battle line, and had no time to make great reflections on the nature of their task.

#### C. The Witch Trials in Sorcery

\[Page 350\]

One would grievously err against the courts, namely those which judged in the better times, and among the greater corporations, where religion, morality, conscience, righteousness, equity, and humanity still counted for something, if one believes: that throughout judgments in this matter had been rendered with levity, inhumanity, and conscienceless harshness. The good judges recognized at all times the uncertain, treacherous ground on which they had to walk. Directed everywhere toward the visible, the tangible, they found themselves here in a world of phantoms, where the knowable seemed only the mask behind which the actual object of the investigation hid itself unrecognizably.

As with the angels in old paintings, so with all the facts a face was indeed visible, but the body vanished into a floating garment, eluding every firm grasp; and everything that according to the claims of the law should have been worked out in solid form dissolved for them into an airy indeterminacy. Even in the very best case, where an unreserved, clear, entirely voluntary confession of the penitent criminal occurred, the doubt did not therefore recede; for he himself was not certain of his cause, and often wavered between the suspicion of deception and the belief in the reality. Only one thing stood indubitably firm and graspable and naked and clear: the flames that the sentence had kindled had neither fantastical nor ideal tongues; they licked and consumed what was offered to them, without leaving a trace behind. Therefore we see at the French parlements the foremost legal experts of the time taking up investigations of this kind, and frequently conducting them to the end with great conscientiousness and mastery.

One clearly recognizes in this process how, there in the progression, a certain practice forms half through instinct, half through deliberation; how the reluctance to enter these regions hostile to the law, and to extend the investigation beyond a certain point, continually increases; how a salutary vigilance establishes itself against the excesses of the lower courts, and how finally other cases are not readily admitted than those which, through their complication with palpable other crimes, provide the investigation with a firm foundation.

There is no cause, where ecclesiastical high courts conducted the investigation, to presuppose that they proceeded with less conscientiousness, although the difficulties for them were still considerably greater, because they had to enter into the inner essence of things, which the secular courts avoided as much as possible; whereby, of course, false views concerning the inner connection of the matter, such as the educational level of the time brought with it, exerted their disadvantageous influence. All these judges, ecclesiastical as well as secular, always directed their strained attention to this connection, and inquired, precisely to calm their conscience, after all means and ways that led into this inner realm, or upon which it emerged toward them, and could now be grasped and mastered. Since theoretical inquiries were of no use to them, they busied themselves mainly with practical means that led to this end, and from which they believed that with their help they would discover the truth. \[Page 351\]

Let us subject the principal of these means, which they gradually adopted, to closer examination. One of the three evident proofs, even in the sorcery trials, was the unanimous testimony of unimpeachable witnesses. The witness must be of unblemished character, and have the presumption in his favor that the good, guarded by conscience, prevails in him; so that he may swear and be sworn to speak the truth. But such witnesses are to be found only in crimes that have come to light in the outer world; in those, however, that belong to the inner world, at the Sabbath, only accomplices can be taken. Thus, in the beginning, it must have provided the judges with a reassuring conviction when they learned that the same event which had occurred at the synagogue found its confirmation in the mouth of ten witnesses; who, when arrested, had no communication with one another, or who, living miles apart, simultaneously made the same unprompted confession.

It seemed a complete proof of the truth of the whole abomination; all the witnesses could not have known what was testified unless they had been present; they had then beheld the incident, and their concordant testimony raised the narrative to complete certainty. But one forgot thereby that all the bystanders must necessarily also have been accomplices; that they all had chosen the demon as their chief, and placed themselves in his service. Now, however, the demon, in his own person, could not be valid before any court as an accusing witness. For concerning the spirits, the theologians rightly predicate that they are confirmed in the choice they made at the test of freedom, and undergo no change.

Those on the good side are thus confirmed in the good, and therefore can utter no lie. But of those on the evil side it is said: they are murderers from the beginning, and have not stood in the truth, for the truth is not in them; when they speak lies, they speak of their own, for they are liars and the fathers of lies. The demon can thus well bear witness to the truth, against his will, through contradiction; but he cannot himself utter it without abandoning his nature; God, however, governs and limits his power indeed, but refrains from doing violence to his spiritual freedom.

But the witch, however, has---under that presupposition---concluded a pact between her own will and his, that he enter into hers with this one, and strengthen him for all evil. Her will is thus his own, and when she gives testimony, then he has begotten it in her. But he cannot give true testimony; rather, his accusation must result in acquittal, and only his testimony, set upon acquittal, lead to condemnation. It changes nothing that the one who is by nature mendacious confirms his statement even under torture; for torture may not, as one has often believed, cleanse the dishonorable one of his guilt and overpower the foreign will ruling in him.

Only the truly pure and genuinely reconciled with God could, as the theologian Tanner rightly remarks, be admitted to such testimony before death. But even if such perfectly valid testimonies were present, nothing more would follow from them than what the testifiers themselves can prove; since they themselves by no means have full conviction whether that which they have seen was reality or illusion, they also cannot prove the former with certainty. The agreement of many who have not previously agreed upon it proves nothing here; for according to the laws of rapport---which were indeed unknown in those times---this concurrence only proves that they have been in spiritual community with one another, and thus ordered around one center, in which they have seen the same vision. Since one felt, with greater or lesser clarity, the inadequacy in this kind of proof, one looked around for others. \[Page 352\]

He who has been bitten by the tarantula doubtless often beholds her image in the vision; because through his condition he remains connected with her. Thus one had also often observed that, when those suspected of causing an obsession approached the maleficiated one, all symptoms of his affliction worsened; and that they, once risen above the horizon of his vision, remained there as the actual tormentors and malefactors. Here it was not the infamous criminals who testified mutually against one another; rather, it was the victims of their infamies who, through the manner in which they were struck by them, had come to clairvoyance in the realm of darkness; and now with sharpened eyes tracked down their enemies in their very hiding places.

This kind of witness-proof was not subject to the objection that made the previous one entirely unusable, and it seemed there was nothing substantial to object against it. We shall consult experience on this, and we choose an event that took place far away across seas, in a Protestant land, among entirely unprepared people. In the year 1602, in New England, in Salem and Dover and the region around Boston, a series of events occurred that cost many people their lives. Two years earlier, in the house of a resident there, Goodwin, a young girl, otherwise of good character, had fallen into obsession; Cotton Mather had taken her into his house and made a report about it known. She had stated that, when her paroxysm approached, someone brought her an invisible horse. She then jumped onto a chair, positioned herself in the posture of a rider, and began to kick and stamp and gallop. She spoke with invisible company that wandered about with her, and listened to their answers. After two or three minutes, she seemed to imagine that she was at a distant place with the witches at an assembly; after which she later, on her invisible horse, returned again, and soon thereafter came back to herself, and told all sorts of things about the Sabbath and the people who had been there.

One sees: it was a demonized somnambulist who had directed her intentions toward the Sabbath and executed them; Mather had experimented with her in various ways, and many eyewitnesses had been present for it. Now it happened that at the end of February 1692, various young persons belonging to the family of the preacher Parris in Salem, and still several others in the neighborhood, began to behave in a strange and unusual manner. They crawled into holes and under chairs and benches, made strange and distorted gestures, spoke wondrous things, and fell into paroxysms of various kinds.

A day of fasting was held on their account, and now the thus afflicted named various persons who, as they said, hovered before their eyes in their paroxysms, and who were the ones inflicting the torments. An Indian woman in the house, who had previously baked a cake to discover the witches, was the most severely blamed; she was beaten and threatened, and now confessed that she was a witch, and that the Devil wanted to force her to sign a book which, according to other testimony, was red, of considerable thickness, and a cubit in length. Meanwhile the number of sufferers had risen to ten; but the number of the accused was far greater still. \[Page 353\]

Testimony was given against one named Cory: that her spectral shape brought them a book to sign, and that she bit, pinched, and strangled them. In the examination she confessed that she had a yellow bird, and that a black man whispered something in her ear. A child of about five years was accused: that all were tormented upon whom it only cast its eyes; it bit the tormented ones in the process, who showed the marks of its little teeth on their arms. On April 11 there was a public examination before six magistrates and some clergymen. The afflicted complained against many, with terrible screaming and gnashing of teeth. Especially against one, Mistress Proctor, the screaming was most vehement; and when her husband came to assist her, screaming was raised against him as well. The afflicted usually fell down upon seeing the accused, and they were then made to recite the Lord's Prayer, and searches were also made for witch-marks, as one was believed to have been found on a certain Bishop.

The accused were always to sign the book, and then they would receive relief; one of them had allowed herself to be induced to sign through her pains, and her affliction had abated. But now she, the former afflicted one, became a tormentor; for her specter appeared to another person and pressed for a signing. One of those thus haunted by her once pointed to a spot where she stood; another who was present, though he saw no one, struck there with a rapier, and now the afflicted cried out: You have given her a thrust in the eye! The struck one soon confessed thereafter: that she had become a witch through the book, and now tormented the maid; but in the process had received two wounds, one in the eye, and a larger one on the side, of which the scar was found upon examination. On May 14, 1692, Sir William took over the government; the matter took a more serious turn, and the witches were put in irons; whereupon it was said that the afflicted felt better and were freed from their torment.

A month later Bridget Bishop was executed, who always maintained her innocence. On July 19 five others followed her in death. Rebecca Nurse, one among them, had at first received a verdict of not guilty from the jury; at this, first all the accusers in the courtroom, and then all the afflicted except her, raised such a terrible screaming that all those present were horrified by it. The jury now assembled for more mature deliberation, the result of which was then guilty. All five defended their innocence to their last breath. On August 10 five more were executed, all of whom steadfastly denied their guilt.

Among them was a clergyman, Mr. Burroughs, who delivered such a moving speech from the ladder, in testimony of his innocence, that many could not restrain their tears. But the accusers said: the black man dictated to him what he should say. John Willard was another of their number, who had earlier arrested many others; but because he became unwilling to seize ever more others, they cried out against him as well. He fled forty miles from Salem, but was recaptured, and those in the paroxysm knew exactly the time, and said: Now Willard is captured. \[Page 354\]

In September Giles Corey gave himself death, because he observed that the jury freed no one. Soon after that, when eight others were executed, the cart at the hill would not move properly; the afflicted said: the devil was holding it back. Captain Alden sat fifteen weeks in prison, and then escaped; likewise Philip English and his wife; their property was confiscated. In October some of the accusers, who boasted of seeing spirits, were summoned by J. Ballard to Andover, to tell him who was tormenting his wife. The people fell into convulsions after their fashion; then they named the persons whom they saw sitting at the head, and others at the feet of the afflicted.

Gradually more than fifty persons were also accused there. Some of those examined confessed their guilt, and added circumstances that authenticated their statements. They agreed therein with the accusations of the afflicted and with one another; they gave the time of their covenant with Satan, and their motives for it; they confessed how they had flown through the air on poles to the Sabbath, how they had mocked the sacraments there, and signed themselves into the book; and they even showed the wounds from which the blood had been taken for it.

They spoke therein of the toads that they had suckled, and showed the sores here as well; a turn of events that, as we have seen, is peculiar to the English school of witchcraft. The confusion grew ever greater; many elders believed their children were witches, many men held their wives to be such. The spirit-seers became more numerous, and they said: they saw the spirits of the murdered hovering over those who had killed them. Thus they spoke of Justice Bradstreet, who himself had committed thirty or forty suspects to prison, that he had murdered nine of them; he saved himself by flight. A dog was soon afflicted; the seers said: the brother of the fugitive was riding it. This one took flight, and the dog was killed. Another dog met the same fate, because they were seized by paroxysm when he looked at them.

Meanwhile, among the accused were also many of the very best reputation, whose Christian disposition no one could doubt; and the number of the accused in general became so great that one could not imagine them all to be guilty. Also the protestations of the nineteen executed had had their effect. Thus one came to consider whether the whole thing might not be Satan's work, who thus deluded the afflicted? The clergy, at the request of the authorities, held a meeting, and here, among other things, the question was put to them: whether Satan could not appear both in the form of innocent and godly persons, as well as in that of guilty and godless ones, in order to deceive those whom he had afflicted? and they answered that he might do so. Now one began to reflect; to be sure, in January 1693 twenty-six were still examined, but only three were convicted, and none more executed. Soon the convicted obtained a reprieve; on April 25 one confessed himself guilty, and yet the jury pronounced him not guilty. \[Page 355\]

And now, after the storm had lasted sixteen months, nineteen at the gallows, one voluntarily deceased, over fifty had confessed to witchcraft, over 150 still sat in the prisons, and more than 200 were yet under accusation; after the judges, like the best of the people, had been reviled, they finally desisted. The accused were set free in all the prisons, the fugitives returned, and peace was restored. With it now came the reactions as well. Since everything had proceeded from the house of the clergyman Parris, and he himself had been a strong zealot in the matter, many withdrew from his congregation and submitted a petition against him: that he had given credence to the accusations of the devil. He acknowledged his error, to be sure, but the accusers did not rest until he was removed.

A day of fasting and repentance was proclaimed, to atone for the congregation. On it, one of the judges stood up in their midst and publicly confessed: that in the recently occurred events he might have erred in many points, and he humbly begged forgiveness. Six of the accused women, who had confessed their guilt, signed a document in which they, among other things, recounted: We were brought to the afflicted persons, who, as they said, fell into their paroxysms upon our arrival. Mr. Barnard then prayed, and our hands were laid upon them, and the seized ones now said: it would become better for them again, and we were guilty of their torments; whereupon we were immediately seized and sent as prisoners to Salem.

We, however, who knew ourselves to be entirely innocent of all that, were exceedingly dismayed, astonished, and confused on account of the sudden assault; so that we almost lost our reason. Since our best friends, beholding us in such a state, believed there was no other means to save our lives, they persuaded us, out of love and pity, to confess that what those others said of us was true. But those were only confessions that were suggested to some of us by others, who said: we were witches, and they knew it, and we knew it likewise; and they knew that we knew it. Since we had now almost lost all understanding, all reason, and all mental faculties, we were not able to judge of our condition; and the most that we said was only an assent to what they chattered to us beforehand.

When we were afterward a little composed again, and they told us what we had confessed; then we certainly said again that we were innocent, and that we knew nothing at all of such things. --- One cannot depict more touchingly and emphatically the state of mind of countless ones who stood in court in such accusations, nor more aptly portray how people, often without malice, impose their delusions upon one another. The twelve jurors likewise signed a document in which they declared: "how they had not been able to comprehend or withstand the mysterious deceptions of the powers of darkness; and how they therefore feared, along with others, though unwittingly and unintentionally, to have loaded upon themselves and the congregation the guilt of blood.

They therefore pleaded with God that He would not impute this guilt to anyone; but all whom they had unjustly offended, they humbly begged forgiveness." That was now good and praiseworthy; but the executed were not thereby brought back to life. The entire narrative vividly illustrates how the good folk had entered the enchanted forest, and became all the more entangled in it the further they advanced. If we consider in this the view that was taken during the investigation: that the demon had caused the confusion; then one sees that he made use therein of two kinds of people as his instruments. \[Page 356\]

The first group consists of the afflicted: their actions were driven by malice, or at the very least, no suspicion had ever been cast upon them; they were clairvoyant, experienced their paroxysms, were struck down by them upon seeing the others, and their numbers grew through the ever-wider spread of the affliction.

The others were the tormentors. On their side the evil, probably with the Indian woman in the same house as Parris, had taken its beginning. Mather writes later, in his history of New England, the whole confusion to the Indian pawwaws or sorcerers, who had sent their spirits among the Europeans. That woman, who wandered about in the kitchen, formed according to him then the transition; and from her the evil passed in pursuit to the ever increasing number of the others. The allegedly acting and the suffering formed two rows; but in their midst stood deciding the red book in between. Who signed belonged to the first, who refused to the others; and if one of these decided upon the signature, he, like that woman, immediately entered the other row, and became spectral.

The evil also passes over to children, even spreads among the domestic animals; one of the two dogs places itself on the side of the afflicted, the other joins the tormentors. Now the question arises: Can one of the two rows give legally valid testimony against the other, without accusing itself? The left could only, if seriously repentant, direct its testimony against itself. The right, the afflicted, are possessed according to the presupposition; but there is no infallible sign by which one could distinguish the possession through immediate incursion of Satan from the obsession through mediation of a third. But if the first were the case, then the thus possessed could not testify against the others that they had obtained Satan through their mediation; these could rather with greater probability give testimony against them that they, the first-possessed, had transferred the devil onto them. But if even an obsession had taken place, two cases are possible.

The left had indeed sent Satan to the right; but this would have been received with conscious consent on the part of the possessed. The ones would then be possessed like the others, there would be only the difference of giving and taking, like that of incubus and succubus in possession; the movements in the neighborhood arose from the community of both, and one would have had the equal right to strike both dead, as was done to the two dogs.

Or the taking possession happened without foreknowledge of the seized; then the accused could reply: You see the devil in you only in our shape, your faith is thus deception, and your testimony false. In all these cases therefore no reliance could be placed on these statements; all advantage was however on the side of the evil, in whose interest the two lines, as the third, that of the judges, worked. For what concerns the first, the more were arrested, the so much greater number became afflicted; and the attacked always complained of new ones who frightened them, and with the number of the confessing the multitude of the defamed increased without end; the judges however were drawn ever deeper into the blood-guilt.

First the magnitude of the evil awakened the healthy understanding to counteraction, and the entanglement became now evident. The circumstance that the animals were drawn into complicity reveals: that a demonic disease in two forms here raged; and it is from what lies before us not to be ascertained how the relation of guilt to misfortune in that evil had been. But that is certain, that the gallows does not belong to the *materia medica* of such plagues. \[Page 357\]

Another test should be provided by the witch marks, which were imprinted during the initiation on the Sabbath. The left side predominated in this. As a rule, it was pricked into the left eye under pain; applied to a cheek, it was sometimes also struck onto the left shoulder, given to the left elbow, bitten into the left side, thrust into the left thigh with the goat's foot, applied through a stab at the left knee, nailed to the same shinbone until it bled, and marked onto the left foot.

Sometimes, however, rarely, the right eye, arm, knee, or the same thigh and foot were also chosen; the mark sometimes bitten into the lower lip, sometimes also painfully set upon the heart, or also according to the Buhler Protocols of 1628: the blood taken at the shame, where the marked one received her witch mark. If one now found this mark, and had it examined by experts in the art with the probe, whether the spot bled, and all sensitivity to pain was lost; then one believed to have an infallible means of getting to the bottom of the matter.

We have previously, in these cases, seen the reverse analogy of the painful bleeding of the stigmatization over the whole body, or at individual places, and explained the phenomena in their opposition, from the contrariety of both states. Thus one mark can indeed bear witness to the reality of a demonic affection, just as the other attests to one of a higher ecstatic state. But the bodily mark is only the outer shell of something inwardly soul-like that has prevailed here, and has sought in it an expression and a body. But into the soul, however, the opposition that produces the contradiction in this body can enter in entirely different spheres.

It can first of all be the religious one, and there, certainly, the holy and the demonic will correspond to the different marks. But already here there is no guarantee that the protruding and the receding mark are altogether necessarily connected with the like inner modality. For just as one has found a stigmatization on the demonic, so the possibility also lies open: that this bloodless, partial insensitivity may also show itself on the holy; since with them too the dryness alternates with the elevation. But just as well the two states can alternate in the personal ethical sphere, in the will, in the imagination, in the domain of the affects.

In all these powers there are impulses of advance and retreat; and if these concentrate themselves bodily at any particular place, then a transgression of the same or a paralysis can occur there. But especially in the domain of life can such an organic outburst, and the revulsion opposed to it, easily take place. For if this life is driven from within outward, by upward- or downward-driving vital or also higher forces, or from without inward through sharply incising natural potencies, into ebb and flood; then the bodily, with all that is movable in it, will take part in this oscillation. If now they are spring tides that have entered, then the organically movable will overflow its usual bounds; it will break out at places that appear determined by the configuration of the fixed, and the undulations and the law of the vibrations of the fluid; and the surface will cover itself with extravasations or eruptions.

But if the spring tide is followed by a neap ebb, or if it occurs exclusively after the animation of the vital force; then the mobile element will follow the backflowing motion, just as in the sea vortex the water yields to the intruding force; and at all nodal points such vortices of the influx will then lie; partial ebbs, a disseminated vacuum; places that are bloodless and insensible, and either exist alone for themselves, or periodically alternate with those outbursts. \[Page 358\]

This will occur all the more easily in all those inwardly magnetic states, where the mobile element on the one hand gains in mobility, the resistance of the fixed element diminishes, and the will and the imagination obtain greater influence. Here it can very easily happen that what occurs nightly in the vision comes forth in bodily and plastic form during the day. Above all, it will be the eye, the microcosmic repetition of the entire organism, in which these fleeting inner affections become fixed and enduring. The iris in particular is, in its movements, as it were, the life pulse of this organ; the opening and closing are recession and advance, and the toad's feet and other formations observed on it are the external signs of a peculiar nervous disposition, which in the own piercing ghostly gaze of such eyes shows itself still more clearly.

This will therefore also extend to all other functions of this organ; a mere cramp will, for example, inhibit the secretion of tears, which in old women is not frequent anyway; and the inability to weep will be, in equal measure, a deceptive and invalid sign for witchcraft, just as are the tremors. That more than 3000 designated persons were found in Labourt, who were almost all children, who testified that they had been at the Sabbath; this proved only in general the cramp-like disposition of the visionary people, who had taken that demonic direction, and were therefore easily susceptible to all those impressions. The judges had found a girl who, according to her statement, wanted to recognize the sorcerers at first glance.

All from Biarritz, she testified, had the toad's foot on the left eye; which those brought in from there also admitted. But the matter could not be verified, as de Lancre says; for she could not clearly demonstrate the signs as she perceived them for herself.¹ The reason was that she herself had been clairvoyant, which now made her testimony useless for the judges; because it applied only in a region into which they could not penetrate; so that for them it could only count as a matter of faith.

Another test for witches was that of cold water. The persons to be tested were thrown into the water three times, with the thumb of the right hand bound to the big toe of the left foot, and the left thumb to the right toe; but in such a way that two men held them loose by a rope. If they were guilty, they floated; whereas sinking was supposed to indicate their innocence. Around the middle of the sixteenth century, this method of testing was first tried again in Westphalia; for, as it seems, this ancient manner of ordeal, which the Franks, Lombards, Normans, and other peoples had already known, was recently brought forth again and applied to the case.

But it was by no means confined to Saxony, but was also customary elsewhere. In the Netherlands, on the Rhine, in Lorraine and Champagne, it occurs everywhere; either under the authority of the courts, or also without it carried out. A notarial act from the year 1696 attests: how five named persons, who had been under suspicion of witchcraft, offered themselves before the notary to undergo the test in the river Seine, not far from Auxerre. It happened in the presence of more than 600 people. \[Page 359\]

They, mostly lean people, swam all, no matter what they did; only two sank, one once, and the other twice. All who had swum were now held to be sorcerers; but the judges gave no further heed to the matter, and the accused departed into exile.¹ In England it was likewise frequently applied; until at the assize held in 1712 at Brentwood, a woman drowned; whereupon Parker, the Lord Chief Justice, forbade it henceforth, because those who practiced it made themselves guilty of willful murder. The belief in the infallibility of the test was so widespread that those who underwent it, as a rule, made their confession when the outcome testified against them.

In the Amt of Linn, in the lower diocese of Cologne, an old woman saw how two women, subjected to the water ordeal, floated on top. She ran at once to the bailiff and did not cease begging him and the assembled judges to subject her also to the test; because she too was under suspicion of sorcery, and now wished to prove it false before the whole world. They finally gave her a hearing; thrown into the water, however, she floated on top, however much she struggled to dive under. Asked why she had been so hostile to her own body? she said: the demon had advised her to undergo the test, he would free her. The unfortunate woman would have paid with her life, had she not taken it herself in the dungeon.

Such confessions must necessarily have strengthened the judges and the people in their opinion of the infallibility of the method. Therefore, elsewhere in Holland, a scale had also been set up, where the suspects were weighed; and if their weight reached a minimum of 18--15 pounds, they were deemed too light and accused of witchcraft. Flying through the air had probably awakened the idea of great specific light- ness, and thus the matter was attributed by many to the demon.

When Scribonius of Marburg was present at such a test in Lemgo in the year 1582, he wrote a letter to the local magistrate interpreting the phenomenon, in which he says: the Satan, specifically light like the air, united with the substance of those bound to him, imparts to them his negative gravity, and keeps them floating on the water.³ But for one thing, witches were in general not possessed by him; from the demon, moreover, the physical properties of weight and lightness cannot be predicated; and the judges, through the test---which in any case was forbidden to Catholics in the canons and decretals as superstitious and tempting God---made themselves guilty of demonic arts.

Therefore the same interpreter later derived the matter from a hatred of the water against witches, which King James also incorporated into his Demonology: because such persons had received baptism in the water, and later renounced it; for which reason the water in turn refused to receive them later. Others maintained again: it was God who directly to the judges, or through the spirits presiding over the elements, allowed his aid to come to them in their office; yet just one step further could have spared them their efforts: namely, if those who had been swimming for a time had been pulled down and drowned. \[Page 360\]

The phenomenon itself was, on the whole, well-founded; the ancients already knew it, according to Philochorus, among the inhabitants of an island in the Pontus who were suspected of sorcery, and the executioners stated, according to their experience, that those whom they had carried bound to the water often distinguished themselves by their extraordinary lightness. One knows how little it takes to prepare a person who already swims on his back by nature, so that he does not sink in any position; and the enforced hunger and need, the asceticism of old women, could only too easily bring about this preparation. If they were driven by this into a more inward region of somnambulism, then they were partly absolved from the law of gravity; as one observes this manifoldly in this state.

Those who had fully penetrated through nature into the realm of grace or of the curse were also exposed to the floodings and ebbings that prevail there; they had become birds of heaven or of the abyss, and while those flew toward the light and the divine as birds of the day, the others directed their flight against the evil and its darknesses. Those who, in poverty already before their death, had returned to nature a part of what they had borrowed from her; those who, in vital magnetism, had already partly unchained themselves from their fetters; those who, clinging to God, had flown upward beyond the earthly, or downward, binding themselves to the evil, had plunged beneath it; the saints and the monsters are found guilty in the same way in this test.

It is therefore entirely deceptive, and experience has long since found it so: that those who had floated high in it could not be brought to confession by any means, and had to be released like the others. Since, therefore, all these tests proved themselves insufficient, would the torture perhaps have supplemented this inadequacy and wrested the carefully guarded secret from its concealer? This infallible means, for the discovery of buried treasures of truth, was taken over from the Romans, who, in their inhuman contempt for slaves, applied it only to this class of men; but to the shame of Christendom, upon its adoption it has been applied to every class.

It seeks to arm pain against reticence, and heightens the torment until it has overcome the strongest stubbornness. The result is: the tormented one is torn asunder, rent, dislocated, and crippled; but with regard to the truth, the uncertainty remains as it was before. For if it is still conducted with some fairness, then the confession as well as the denial, uttered in the midst of its pains, is taken with indifferent sense as incontrovertible truth. But it has nothing of this character of apodictic certainty, but rather leaves the judgment entirely undecided between opposing probabilities. For the tortured one has been innocent or guilty. In the first case, he resists with the feeling of his innocence, with the dread of death and shame, and in earlier times with the terror of the threatened damnation if he should speak lies in the decisive moment, against the pains pressing upon him, overcomes them, and persists in denial; if, namely, he possesses the superhuman steadfastness to endure the superhuman.

In the other case it is the feeling of his guilt, in order to escape death and shame, which with stubbornness seals his mouth; he likewise remains victor in that struggle, and denies like the first one. Torture has extorted two negative confessions, one of which is truth, the other lie; there is no sign by which one might recognize each in its kind; both must be taken as true, and everything is as it was before the torture, when both simply denied their guilt. Or conversely: both succumb in their strife, they are overpowered by the unbearableness of the sharpened pains and confess. \[Page 361\]

Thus two affirmative confessions have been wrung from them, one of which was false, the other true; but they again, in their truth and falsity, cannot be recognized by any external sign, and therefore, taken as proofs, will ground one just and one unjust judgment. 549 All probabilities will even speak in favor of the fact that the guilty one, to whom in the rule rather the extraordinary strength that belongs to the successful struggle stands ready, covers his guilt through denial; while the innocent one, taken at random from the common heap of men, is unable to muster that power, and through confession will ruin himself. There is thus no guarantee for what is extorted; the fear of death can give no such, for it, as the more remote, will be far outweighed by the presence of the pain.

The nature of human nature can guarantee such still less; for it is placed in a situation that lies beyond all lawfulness and obligation, and where nothing but the law of self-preservation holds.

This whole matter Augustine has already expressed in these words with striking aptness: "If someone is tortured on accusation, and, to find out whether he is guilty, tormented; then the harshest punishments are inflicted on the innocent one, for the sake of a crime not committed, not because it is discovered that he committed them, but because it is not known that he did not commit them. Therefore the judge's not-knowing is in the rule the misfortune of the guiltless one. And what is still more unbearable, and still more to be lamented, and to be wept over with inexhaustible tears: since the judge therefore tortures the accused, so that, not instructed by the truth, he may not kill the innocent one; it comes about through the misery of not-knowing that he kills the tortured one and the innocent one, whom he tortured in order not to kill the innocent one. For if he prefers to give up life rather than endure these pains any longer; then he will confess that he committed what he really did not commit. If he is now condemned and executed, then the judge still does not know whether he has killed the guilty one or the innocent one; whom he nevertheless tortured in order to prevent the killing of the guiltless one, so that he tortured the innocent one in order to gain insight; and, remaining without that insight, killed him."

Had one only weighed these words through so many centuries, one would not have defiled and stained oneself with the practice of this brutal method of penetrating into the secrets of guilt and innocence.

### Chapter 2. The Errors, the Good Observance, and the Inhumanities of the Usual Procedure

The preconditions were not fulfilled, and in part also not fulfillable; the means, the proofs, and the tests were ambiguous, uncertain; departing from the firm ground of human reality, on which above all the law must maintain itself, into unsafe, pathless, often fantastical regions where only the divine ordinance holds, and the civil legal determination often finds no application. \[Page 362\]

One can easily imagine oneself in the position of conscientious and religious judges who, on the one hand, had to pass judgment on a crime that was, as it were, principled and enormous, one that enclosed within itself the seeds of all other crimes; but who, as soon as they undertook their duty in this matter, immediately plunged into a trackless, boundless, confused, and confusing wilderness, where things had faces that faded into gray, but no bodies that could be grasped in any way; where one thing continually passed into another in playful transformation; where falsehood clothed itself in a thousand forms of truth, which danced around them with will-o'-the-wisp-like shapes, mocked their seriousness, and took every pains to turn the intended court into a witches' sabbath. One sees: their power of judgment was in no way equal to even the most frequently occurring cases of ordinary criminality.

Whoever had once mounted the airy steed in this fork-riding, had completely withdrawn himself from the jurisdiction of earthly judges; he had literally risen above the law; whatever he might do, practice, and effect, whatever crimes he might heap up, all these criminal deeds, as long as they remained in this airy realm, were like gusts of wind; and even if a spark from them struck downward, the invisible origin could not be traced; the scales of justice had only foam and dream to weigh; a burden for which no system of measure and weight had yet been found, not even a balance. The judges, therefore, had to count themselves fortunate if a simple case, still within the scope of their jurisdiction, was brought before them; if tangible and weighable crimes had emanated from this transcendent source, and if an unforced, voluntary confession confirmed this origin. Such a case then undoubtedly fell under their court's authority, and it was probably the only combination in which they could exercise it with the best conscience and with success.

They then had only to ascertain the crimes themselves in their practical aspect; with regard to their origin, to establish the imputability and mental presence of the accused; and then confidently to pronounce the judgment in accordance with the laws. If these conditions are fulfilled with conscientiousness, attention, and insight, then in these matters the good observance is formed.

#### A. The Good and Secure Practice

There is no lack, neither in ecclesiastical nor in secular courts, of examples of the most blameless administration of justice in such cases. We select from them only one, the case of del Vaulx in Stablo, because of its rounded completeness, and because the judge himself recounts it from the records. Chapeauville, canon in Liège, reports the following about this legal proceeding. In the year 1595, Johannes del Vaulx, a member of the old and famous monastery of Stablo, had been imprisoned by his prior on suspicion of poisoning and other crimes; which, when it came to the knowledge of the abbot and administrator of the monastery, prompted him to send me there.

I saw the man, who by God's grace had grown weary of the demon's tyranny, and who, in the first conversation with me and the prior, opened up his entire life to us with many tears. For when he had tended the herds of his elders, and his boyhood had already been stained with abominable crimes, after his fifteenth year had arrived, he had seen an old man in long and seemingly clerical garb walking through the forest, who asked him: whether he would serve him and obey him? He would, as a reward, bring him to high honors in the state that he himself chose, to which he had then boldly agreed at once. \[Page 363\]

Afterwards, he appeared to him in other and ever other monstrous forms, and also pressed into his shoulders two marks, which we examined; then carried him to the nocturnal assemblies, over many places, and provided him with poisons, with which he killed the cattle of the elders and of others, and also, in addition, human beings; and then accompanied him on his studies to Trier. On his advice, he then took the habit and immediately the orders of the priesthood; and removed the prior along with other order clerics, in order to gain the priory, by poison. But he had still many participants in his crimes and malefactions.

When I reported this to the prelate, he resolved: to have the case judged in the legal manner. He therefore sent the reverend Mr. A. Stregnart, suffragan, and me with a notary once more to Stablo; we interrogated him on all individual articles, and recorded his statements in writing. Since we noticed during the interrogation that the demon had taught him many pagan and heretical errors; we instructed him in the doctrine of the one and triune God, of the good and evil spirits, of immortality, of the future life, as well as in some other fundamental doctrines of our faith. The prelate wanted: that a thorough examination be conducted with him, so that, if he were brought to true repentance and stood by his statements --- but he accused more than 500 accomplices ---, these testimonies might have all the greater credence.

After weighing the confession and the accusations made, the prelate dispatched a commission to his principality of Stablo; whereby he transferred to his suffragan A. Stregnart, to me his general vicar, then to Father Oranus, pro-chancellor of his council and assessor of Liège, as well as to Mr. Molempeter, advocate of the fisc, all authority: to judge over the whole matter, to pass sentence, to execute the judgment; and if necessary, to call in the ordinary and feudal judges, knowledgeable in the laws and customs. In consequence thereof, we set out at the beginning of 1500 for Stablo, in a carriage which broke in two in the middle on the way; so that we had to cover the rest of the journey on horseback. We arrived still in the evening at the monastery, and visited the prisoner, who, upon our greeting, without returning it, at once brought forward excuses regarding the incident with the broken wagon.

Not his demon, he said, who had never done him any harm, had caused it; but another evil-minded one had committed it. At the break of the following day, he was examined and interrogated on the articles fixed by the fisc, and he persisted steadfastly in his first confession, not only naming his accomplices, but also specifying precisely: to which sodality they belonged; whither he had been nocturnally abducted with them; what criminal acts had been practiced there, what had been done in honor of the presiding demon; in what order the banquets had been held, the minglings had taken place, and the enchantments of humans, cattle, and fruits had been performed. \[Page 364\]

The names, status, and circumstances of the accused persons were thereby determined with the utmost precision. But we, in order to test the consistency of his words, and to close the mouth of slander, waited some days before visiting him again; then reminded him of his salvation, and warned him that on this account he should beware of falsely accusing anyone. Thereupon we read to him his statements and accusations again, but in reverse and confused order; so that we placed those whom he had put in the first row, say, under the second and third, and vice versa. But he then insisted: that he had not said so, that the words had not been correctly recorded; that the matters stood thus, whereupon he repeated his earlier statements in their order.

We held it thus more often, for he had accused both clergy and laymen. Thus he said: that he had often visited the Trier assembly, where D. Vlaet, electoral councilor, who was burned there as a sorcerer, had presided; and that he had also had at this place a beautiful and charming girl, a fisherwoman, as his beloved, who after every assembly presented him with fish. After we had heard all this most wondrous from him, we nevertheless interrogated him still more often in formal sessions, treating him mildly and inquiring of him in every way the truth about his life and his deeds; but we found him in all things so steadfast and consistent with himself that we dismissed all suspicion of madness in his mind.

Oranus, who now, as I write this (1616), lives at 76 years of age in great vigor, and I myself, we visited him out of Christian love moreover still often in the room wherein he lived; we questioned him often about everything that we had learned in part from writings, in part from his confessions. But he always adduced weighty reasons that proved that what he had confessed had not occurred through deceitful demonic impressions, merely in the imagination, as we suggested and as it seemed probable to us; but rather truly, really, hypostatically and personally encountered him, and he indicated certain signs by which he could recognize when he had actually attended the assemblies and committed this or that, and when merely in the imagination.

When we had communicated the records to the prelate, and he recognized more and more the importance of the matter, he commanded us: to open the instruction of the process against the accused, both clergy and laymen; which then throughout the course of this year, up to the tenth of January of the following, was done with equal diligence and equal attention. It had been impressed upon us: not merely to lay hands on old women and men from the common folk, but also against the notables of the place, the mayor named Kannerlink, the judges and the pastor, as well as some religious persons distinguished by age, spirit, learning, and judgment. On the 10th of January 1597, after an advocate and syndicus had been assigned to the prisoner, the articles of accusation of the fiscal were read to him before the assembled court, along with the responses that he had made and maintained thereto thereafter; whereupon he clearly, frankly, and persistently declared and confessed: that he could make no change in the admitted sorceries, nor in the accused persons, or render any retraction, without placing the salvation of his soul in danger. \[Page 365\]

Since the fiscal now urgently pressed for the pronouncement of judgment against the confessing accused, the terms set for the verdict were prorogued nine times on account of the importance of the matter; and just as often the guilty one was reminded of the peril of his previous life under the dominion of the devil, and how he had mocked the almighty God, his service, and his religion; he should therefore take care not to rob himself of all hope of salvation through empty and fabricated confessions, or false and slanderous accusations. He said again and repeated himself ever: that he could change nothing in what he had previously confessed, or retract anything whatsoever without lying and perjury. He hoped only for a merciful judgment; and that was his sole, fervent desire, that after renouncing the devil, reconciled once more to the almighty and merciful God, he might obtain his grace. The syndicus, dissatisfied with this, demanded that the clergy of Stablo, who, infected by the poison and still lying sick, be interrogated thereon. Aegidius Harsetanus, the prior, Mauritius of Offl, Quirin of Generet, Cornelius Neufforge, and Paschasius Lymburg were thereupon examined, all of whom testified: how they indeed considered themselves harmed by the poison that their fellow brother Del Baulr, or his companions, had placed in various places in the monastery.

The syndic now proposed: to proceed according to the records, and to condemn the guilty to be interrogated under torture; so that the confession regarding his accomplices might thereby be proven, and gain greater evidentiary force. This exhortation was made in the presence of the accused, who merely implored the mercy of the Almighty God. Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted: In the matter of J. Vilars, syndic of the Abbey of Stablo, plaintiff, against H. J. Del Vaulr, a member of that monastery, accused of sorcery, which matter remains pending before us, J. Chapeauville, commissioner specially appointed by His Highness; upon the counsel of those learned in divine and human law, to whom the state of the case has been communicated, it is resolved and pronounced: The aforesaid accused shall, before proceeding to the full resolution of his case, be rigorously questioned, and further interrogated under torture. Given on the 19th of March 1597.

When this decree became known, amid the bitterness of many of those accused of sorcery, the rumor spread: that we had been dealing with a deranged and senseless man. In order to dispel this rumor, we summoned the lords Ludwig von Viset, prior of Malmedy, a man of proven and tested truthfulness; Hubert von Verlemont; Gabriel Neufforge, steward of Stablo; Remigius Ultrapontanus; Wilhelm Rane, podestà of Malmedy; Adolph von Rahier, the schultheiss of Bodeur; P. von Noirfalli, schultheiss of Chenron; as well as other clerics, noble and esteemed men, officials and magistrates, among whom some were also suspected of sorcery. In their collective presence, J. Del Vaulr was now repeatedly questioned anew regarding the confessions and accusations. He always responded undauntedly, steadfastly, and aptly to everything put before him; so that he corrected all the errors and perverse narratives that we had intentionally fabricated, as well as the objections of the suspects, who made them vehemently against him; and, providing good reasons from all sides, he entirely refuted the opinion of his mental derangement.

Yet with this, his adversaries were still not pacified, but rather spread about: how, during the time of his imprisonment, he had written letters to the lords de la Bourlotte and de Goberville, as well as to D. de Wils, in which matters were contained that pointed to madness: in that he called them his nephews; and therein promised to do away with all enemies of the Catholic king through his arts and his secrets, and more of the like. \[Page 366\]

When earnestly questioned, he replied firmly and calmly: that at that time he had played the fool and the delirious, pretending kinship, and spoken of the fall of the king's enemies, so that he might be released from prison on the grounds of madness; on this statement he persisted during three and four interrogations. After all this was concluded in judicial and customary manner, he said, when the acts were repeated from the beginning and translated into the language of the country for those ignorant of Latin, repeatedly: all confessions and accusations written down here are entirely true; and everything he stated therein about persons was truly done and committed. Then he was confronted with J. von Frounille, the pastor of Stablo, whom he accused of sorcery. When D. Oran, extremely experienced in these legal matters, wondered at the categorical denials of the pastor, Del Vaulr removed all his wonder in my presence by explaining to him the secret of silence among sorcerers. A solemn oath is repeated annually over this in all gatherings, and it had not long been taken in that of Stablo; at which he had been present and had recognized the said Frounille very well.

Now the syndic of the court demanded: that all his statements and references, and the confessions of the accused, be read out again, and then the latter, under invocation of God, be questioned on oath and under threat of eternal damnation: whether he persists in his oft-repeated confession, or has anything contrary to testify. The accused, after the punishment for perjury had been solemnly explained to him, answered firmly: all his confessions and accusations are entirely true, and he can and will retract nothing of them. With this testimony the syndic would not be satisfied, but now moved for the application of the rack, not to elicit further confession, but to confirm the one already given; so that the guilty of the crime might have no cause to complain. The accused, when all his testimony was read out to him again, insisted upon it, calling God to witness under oath.

Proceedings now advanced to the rack; the accused testified under torture, as the articles of the fiscal were presented to him one by one, at peril of his salvation and damnation: that all and every one he had named had been accomplices in the sorcery; that he had seen and recognized them in the assemblies, and had committed and carried out with them everything he had stated. Earnestly reminded again to consider maturely all that he had said and confessed, and to accuse no one guiltlessly; after prayers and exorcisms had also not been omitted over him, he confessed openly and firmly: everything said and confessed is the pure truth, and no one is slandered or unjustly accused; this he testified on the mercy of God Almighty, to which he, after revoking the vows made to the demon, betook his refuge, and awaited forgiveness for his poor soul, which had hitherto been in a state of despair. Finally, the improbability of so great a number of accomplices and confederates was set before him; which we did to test his reliability, but he nonetheless stood by his word. After common prayers and new exorcisms, he was again urged to say nothing against the truth; under repetition of the solemn oath he remained by his testimonies and accusations, and avowed: that he would hold to them until the end of his life. \[Page 367\]

After all those present had unanimously reminded him once more of the consequences of perjury and the dangers of false accusation, and he had sworn for the second and third time that he had said nothing against the accused persons except what he himself had seen and heard; he was released from the torture and led to the hearth, unharmed in his limbs, for the torture had been only mild. We had also seen the marks on his shoulders at that time, and tested them with a needle, which we drove deep into them without his feeling any pain from it. Since all this had now thus taken place, the fiscal requested a legally valid transcript of what had occurred, and declared, after receiving it, that he would and must make use of it not only against the accused but also against every other person, as testimony and foundation for every investigation. He further moved that the defendant be summoned for the seventh hour of the second of April, in order to hear his judgment in proper form from the mouth of the commissioner and judge D. \[something\] v. Chapeauville. The notification of this summons was thereupon attested by Henricus Harsetanus, the cleric, with his own handwritten signature.

The judgment read as follows:

Whereas thou, F. Del Baulr, priest and abbot in Stablo, art convicted not only by many reports, witness testimonies, and public rumor, but also by thy oft-repeated confession, of having denied the faith and religion to which thou didst profess thyself at baptism, not merely with thy mouth but also in thy heart and soul, and in opposition thereto of having dedicated thyself to the demon, the enemy of the human race; whereas thou hast worshipped him at the nocturnal assemblies repeatedly; hast also concluded a pact and vow with him in order to commit maleficia, to obtain honors, pleasures, riches, and other earthly goods besides; and, to confirm the pact, hast obtained his marks on thy shoulders; whereas thou hast caused the death of several fellows of the abbey of Stablo, namely the lords Antonius von Salm, the prior of this monastery, Perpetuus, Aegidius Warsegnius, Anton Harsetanus, Heinrich de Rahier, Leonard Fronduille, Corbelius Neufforge, and others of the lay estate, namely Nicolaa, the widow left behind of Heinrich von Houfalize, the wife of the foreman of the same place, and J. v. Morimon, citizen of Stablo, by means of poison which the demon gave thee; and furthermore hast committed many other abominable crimes with demonic succubi, as well as with married and unmarried women; for which thou deserves not only to be deposed from all offices and degrees, but truly degraded and handed over to the secular arm, according to the ordinance of the holy canons.

We, therefore, in order that such crimes, under the pretext of thy priestly order and monastic vows, may not remain unpunished, but that thou in this life shalt undergo a punishment to some satisfaction for thy sins and vices, for the reparation of the scandal, as an example and terror to the wicked, and for the edification of the pious: do hereby decree by this our final judgment that thou be stripped of all office and every dignity, declared worthy of actual deposition, and handed over to the secular arm; as we now in fact do strip thee of thy offices and dignities, degrade thee, and hand thee over to the secular arm; while however beseeching the judges and officers of the secular jurisdiction that they, insofar as the law permits, may abstain from bloodshed.

In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

Given on the 2nd of April 150; in the morning at 8 o'clock. \[Page 368\]

After the reading of this judgment, the degraded and stripped of his dignity was handed over to Prochancellor Oranus and Fiscal Advocate Molempeter, whom the most worthy Suffragan had appointed for this purpose; who now, with the involvement of some notables, wise assessors, and honored persons, after reviewing and carefully weighing the records, decided: J. Del Baulr should be executed with the sword, but then buried in consecrated ground in the churchyard of the monastery. The reason for the mitigated punishment was: because he had been in a state of accusation for five years, and during this time had been confined in a dark dungeon, living on bread and water; and what is more, had proven through his tears and sighs that he felt remorse over the past.

When his judgment was read to him, as he knelt dissolving in tears, he thanked them for the mitigated punishment; and asked the Prior that the ration, which according to custom was distributed to the poor for forty days after the death of every monastic cleric, should not be withheld in his case either; so that the poor might pray to God for the forgiveness of his grave crimes. One must say, such a careful, patient, thorough, prudent, zealous, and yet merciful procedure, while it does the court all honor, must entirely disarm every doubt about the justice tempered by love in its entire proceeding and its definitive judgment. No reasonable doubt could find place regarding the thoroughness of his remorse; the state of his mental faculties had been found completely satisfactory in every thorough investigation. One must therefore lend full credence to his statements about himself and the innermost ground of his actions.

This was demonic, because he had made the demon the principle of these actions, which as usual had led to murder and manslaughter. One might say that these latter did not appear to have been properly investigated; but given the insight and thoroughness with which the entire process was conducted, one must believe that this too was not lacking there, and that the compressed brevity of the presentation prevents further elaboration; just as it does not allow use to be made of the interrogations of the other accused. The judges could thus only apply the existing laws, and their conscience might fully rest at ease with the pronounced judgment.

#### B. The Errors in the Course of the Judicial Procedure Before the Ecclesiastical authority

With God, in all cases, good and sincere justice is to be found; because He, justice itself, looks into the inner and whole of the one to be judged. If something approximately similar is to become possible at a human court, then the accused must open his closed inner self before the judges without reserve; so that these, recognizing the invisible as well as the visible, may assign to each his exact right. So it was in the case just recounted: Del Vaulr has withheld no secret from his own; they have tested his sincerity with care; they have devoted equal attention to the investigation of the state of his mental faculties, and have found everything well ordered and proven; and thus nothing remained for them but the application of the law. But the same one who here, as the only valid witness over the state of his inner self, has given good account, has at the same time also made accusations against others whose inner selves were entangled with his, and who thereby took part in his crime.

His statements were examined with the same conscientiousness; the state of remorse and contrition in which he found himself provided an opportunity to probe the basis of it; and the swift, as it were unconscious, restoration of their inner coherence, whenever he was fleetingly confused, testified to the reality of the representations that otherwise would have flowed into one another like fading dreams. \[Page 369\]

It was evident: he himself had the same conviction of the truth of these facts as of those that concerned himself; the same reasons that spoke for the evidence of the one also made themselves felt for that of the other; it seemed beyond doubt, these statements were fully as authentic as the others; if any could be used as testimonies of an eyewitness and earwitness for judicial proofs, and to proceed further on that basis. Yet it is not so, and precisely here begins the possible error that can creep into these procedures. Del Vaulr had gazed into the distance, and seen the accident with the approaching judges' carriage, and communicated his vision, before anyone informed him of what had occurred. He was thus clairvoyant, all his statements therefore rested on visions that had come to him; whereas what he reported about the state of his own inner being referred predominantly to clear, lucid intuitions. His soberly reflecting self stood in an entirely different relation to his mystically beholding self than the latter did to the equated spheres of other personalities; and the inner spiritual activities followed entirely different laws in their effects.

Had the visions all been realities, then to be sure these differences would have balanced out again in the general lawfulness of nature, and the unity of the whole human being would have absorbed the differences within itself. He himself regarded them as a rule to be real, and in translating them into the language of ordinary life had noted certain signs by which he believed he could distinguish the truly real from those that were only apparently so. But these signs were not infallible, not even for him himself; as Oran related to his friend and Delrio: he was nevertheless sometimes uncertain whether everything had not altogether merely transpired in the vision.

Thus in this daemonic vision, with the conviction of its ideality or reality, it is precisely the same as in the higher mystical one regarding the insight into its relation to truth and deception; whose uncertainty we learn from Maria of Agreda, who despite the long years of apprenticeship and the most earnest discipline in which she held herself on the path of her progress, yet sometimes became doubtful whether deception had not beset her. If in this kind of visions nothing at all blameworthy has shown itself, if all signs have declared themselves for their authenticity; if they have been indubitably accompanied by the infused higher light that awakens and sharpens the inner higher instinct, the discerning spiritual conscience, so that it separates deception from truth with all certainty; then, as we have seen above, the Church gives its assent: in such a way, however, that it holds the seer himself obligated to ascribe belief to the content of his vision, according to the measure of his conviction; but by no means compels others to the same agreement, as it demands such for its doctrines, but rather recommends them only as credible, as subsidiary support of the faith, for acceptance; leaving the measure of assent to each, and only rejecting unconditional repudiation. Should it now be otherwise with the daemonic vision? Del Vaulr had, with all the certainty that can enter in this domain, the conviction of the reality and truth of his own; and the court had to allow this conviction to stand, insofar as it concerned himself. \[Page 370\]

But otherwise it was constituted with regard to that part of them in which other actual human beings were drawn into the circle that she enclosed. Here his conviction, against the denial of these people, could not make itself valid; because they were not obliged to accept his visions as infallible truths. The court, therefore, could grant to the accusations from this source---however well they might be judicially confirmed---no other validity, especially in questions where life and death were at stake, than a mere subsidiary one, which could indeed support an accusation but by no means establish it. In truth, what are visions other than beholdings into the interior of things, which now represent themselves symbolically; because the hitherto seen exterior is now only a shell and expression for the newly attained and emerging interior. One could easily imagine that a magnetic somnambulist might have the visions of summer and of winter.

The center of the first would be the sun at the summer solstice. From this center she would see the streams of light and those of warmth descending toward the earth; these would set the electric currents in motion in her vicinity, which, now conjoined with the propelling ones, would quicken the three lower elements---air, water, and earth---so that they in turn would awaken the hidden germs of life, which now would burst forth at all the nodal points of the earth. As all those outer movements now arouse corresponding inner ones, and unfold themselves in the now flowing streams, the earth would then cover itself with green before her eyes, and in the midst of the thus unfolding vegetation the animal kingdom too would soon develop itself to her, each according to its time.

That would be a wild swelling, flowing, surging, waving, weaving, flaming and blazing and radiant life; to behold it from its outermost extension to the innermost fountainhead in closest proximity, but in all its members, all plant and animal genera, all natural forces and faculties, expressed only in symbols. The center of the second vision would be the winter pole of the earth, which, in the remoteness of the sun, has selfishly enclosed itself. From this center the binding, congealing forces of darkness and cold would take their origin; they would, if dealing with freedom, murderously destroy all animal and plant extensions down to their germs, and then, burying these germs in the congealed earth, frost them over with rime, pelt them with hail, and cover them with snow; even the element of air would, wingless and bound, lay itself down around the rigid waters for winter's sleep: for everywhere the magnetic force would only rule, and the ancient night would at last enclose everything in her gloom.

The one would be the summer dream of life of the earth, summed up in one intuition; the other her stony and iron winter sleep, felt in the innermost root of death. To these natural visions there must correspond two others, beheld in the interior of the spiritual realm. For the seer might behold the daylight side of humanity in general, or of a society friendly to him in particular, that is turned toward the sun of eternity, how it, connected with this its center, receives into itself its vivifying effluences; how the forces and faculties, touched by them, according to their orders and hierarchies, become ensouled and exalted in the warming ray, flowing: so that all spiritual pulses beat more strongly, all energies tense themselves more powerfully, all virtues, purified and transfigured, express themselves in their effects with joyfulness. That would be the vision of a superterrestrial Sabbath, held on the bright heights of the earth, and bringing before intuition the inner connection of all good on earth, and its deepest origin from the primal source of all blessing. \[Page 371\]

What, then, can the vision of the Sabbath mean, which is held upon the midnight-dark heights, other than a sight of the inner spiritual intercourse that exists between the night-side of the conjoined ones and the root-like evil, which through its influences demonizes all the forces of this side; so that, while all the self-willed passions of the most radical ones are bound together, these operate in every one through the power of all. That such a connection exists, given the continuity that prevails through all realms of being, is beyond doubt; here only what hides itself in invisibility in ordinary life is brought to light for contemplation; so that the entire web of attracting and repelling forces comes to the fore.

The form of the entire vision is also here a symbolic one; all vices appear, according to their kinds and species, in great images; all their connecting threads with the heart, which beats in them all, are concrete, demonic personalities; all the accessories have their own peculiar significance, and the inversion of all the distorted, mirror-reflecting forms is the ruling law. The interpretation of these symbols is, like that of the images in the second vision, a matter that demands great insight and experience. That the crimes which appear in the vision have concretely and really taken place is by no means a necessary condition: for just as the seer himself throughout appears personally withdrawn from the realm of action; so too do his images throughout express only in a general manner how the orders to which this or that person belongs, in their present disposition and position, find themselves driven to act in relation to the conditioning world-powers, and under certain circumstances actually do act.

Only the earthly birth of things, just as in the vision ascending upward the super-earthly one, is here indicated: but for this to become earthly, the accession of a third, likewise earthly, moment is required, which first activates the matter into a particular deed; which, if it is of evil root, alone belongs before the courts, which, if they disregard it, immediately lose themselves in apocalyptic interpretations. How seductive, therefore, his statements had been in the matter of de Vaulx, one sees nowhere that use was made of them. And one did well thereby, and thereby averted the danger of shedding innocent blood. That in other similar cases, where even such an outwardly well-secured foundation was lacking, equal prudence was not shown; but rather, incautiously carried away by an unbridled zeal, has already in earlier times wrought much mischief.

We select from among them the trial in Arras, which began in the year 1459, in that we here share in extract the account that is preserved in the chronicles of Du Clercq. The reports are admittedly not from the records, but at least, without hatred and without love, written down from the events of the day on the spot. In the city of Langres, in Burgundy, Robinet de Baulx from Artois, who had passed himself off as a hermit, had expiated the charges against him with death by fire, and his statements had run as follows: many men and women were his companions in the Waldensianism, the local name at that time for heretical being. Among others, he had accused a prostitute from Douai named Deniselle, and J. la Vitte, called Abbé de Pessens, thereof. The inquisitor in Arras, Peter le Brousart, had learned of this, and first had Deniselle arrested, and then also la Vitte, after he had learned of his residence in Abbeville, and had them locked up in the episcopal prisons. \[Page 372\]

The vicars of the bishop, P. du Hamel, J. Thieubault, J. Pochon, and M. du Hamel, to whom J. du Bois also joined himself, had interrogated the first one several times on the rack; where she then confessed her participation, as well as that she had seen the others take part. This one, while arrested, had attempted to cut out his tongue, but it had not succeeded for him; however, he was laid on the rack, even though at first he could not speak, where he then had to write down his confessions. He testified again against others whom he had seen at the Sabbath: two men and four women, among whom again three joy-girls. These were immediately arrested; but since the matter, through the multitude of the accused, seemed to be spreading far and wide, most of the investigators were of the opinion to give it no further pursuit and to release the prisoners.

But Master J. du Bois, dean of Our Lady in Arras, opposed this proposal, and the suffragan of the bishop, Brother Johann, joined his view. They went to the Count of Estampes at Peronne, who immediately came over to Arras and commanded the vicars to do their duty; otherwise they would have to answer to him for the consequences. Accordingly, the arrested ones were now again laid on the rack and otherwise questioned, and their confessions were sent by the vicars to Cambrai; where the doctor of theology, Gilles Carlier, a seventy-year-old man, one of the most eminent clerics of the Christendom of that time, as dean of the main church, as well as M. Nicolai as canon, resided; these were consulted for their advice in this matter. Their opinion is said to have been that, if the arrested ones recanted, they should not be subjected to the death penalty the first time; unless they had committed murders or abused the body of our Lord.

But Master Johann and the dean du Bois were of the opinion: All who had taken part in the Waldensian rite must die the death; also all who would be accused by them, if, in case of their not confessing, they were convicted by rack or in other ways, with witnesses. They gave themselves all effort to make this their opinion prevail, and I have heard the dean himself say: the third part and more of Christendom is infected by the Waldensians: he knows much of it, which he cannot say, and if he were permitted to speak it out, one would be horrified by it. All who had been accused thereon were real participants, and those who were not could not be accused. If objections were made against this view, whether by clerics or laymen, those who did so were called: such must be immediately taken into custody as suspected of Waldensianism. \[Page 373\]

The same also said: if it came to pass that some of the guilty were led to the stake, then it was not to be doubted how the devil would tempt them to that, that in the hour of death they would retract everything they had confessed and admitted, so that they would immediately be damned to hell. In all this he was supported by M. Jehan, bishop of Varut, who had been grand penitentiary in Rome in the year 1450; for which reason one also believed that much had become known to him. He also had such an imagination that, if he only looked at people, he judged and declared whether they had been in the Waldensians or not. For this reason he also held: bishops and even cardinals had been in it; and there were so many of them that, if they could draw a king or eminent prince into their interest, they would be powerful enough to rise up against those who did not belong to theirs, and to do them all injury and shame.

Both said also: as soon as anyone should be accused of this crime, no one might take his part; no one, be it father, mother, brother, sister, or whatever relative, under penalty of being himself regarded as an accomplice; moreover, those belonging to the Waldenses, if they learned of their accusation, might not escape the investigation by flight. Accordingly, they arrested yet another new accused person, and had the vicars once more admonished by the Count of Estampes to hasten the process. The vicars therefore assembled all the esteemed clergy of the city, together with the most skilled advocates, laid before them the records with all the depositions from the seven accused, and then proceeded, after the assembly had been heard on the matter, to the execution.

All the condemned were brought to the scaffold, save one who had hanged himself in the dungeon, and the mitre with the figure of the devil was placed upon them; Father le Brousart delivered a sermon to the kneeling ones, and thereupon set forth to them what they had done and perpetrated. They had, he said, anointed a very slender rod and the palm of the hand with the ointment, and had then flown over cities and forests to their meeting place. There they had found richly laden tables, there the demon in the form of a goat, a dog, a monkey, sometimes a man; they had worshipped him, and dedicated to him either their soul or a part of their body; and with burning lights in their hands, had kissed his behind. They had immediately spat upon the crucifix and trodden upon it, and the abbé de la Biche had been the guide of all the newly received.

They had at the same time pointed their behinds at the heavens and the firmament, in mockery of God. And after they had eaten and drunk their fill, carnal mingling had followed, in which the demon had taken part in the form of man and woman: sodomy and bestiality and all the stinking vices that the speaker would not name had been committed therein. Toads, fed with the consecrated host, then burned, mixed with the bone-ash of hanged men, moistened with the blood of children, and compounded with herbs and other things by the abbé, had formed the ointment. The Church had been forbidden to them; they had been permitted to take holy water only with the words: May it not displease our master! \[Page 374\]

The demon preached to them: there is no other life than the present one; for they have no soul. After he had thus reproached them and more, he asked each one in turn whether all this had not indeed come to pass so? All, even the abbé, affirmed it. Thereupon they were severed from the Church as infected members, and handed over to the secular court; and their property was confiscated for the sovereign, their movable goods however for the bishop. The four women were sentenced to death by fire in Arras; but when they heard the sentence, they cried out like desperate ones to Master Gilles Flameng, who was just then present: Ha, false traitor! thou toldest us we should only confess what was dictated to us; we should then be let go, and have no other penance to perform than perhaps a pilgrimage six or twelve hours distant.

Thou knowest, abominable one! that thou hast deceived us. They said moreover: they had never been in the Waldensian sect; what they had confessed had been extorted from them by torture, or lured from them by the promises of that M. Gilles and others, and much more besides. But that availed them nothing; they were led to the stake. They prepared themselves Christianly for death, but maintained to their last breath that they knew not what the Waldenses were; which words gave the people much to think and talk about. The same happened with the demoiselle in Douay, where she was executed.

Even the abbot of Depuysens held the same speeches, and said: he died without guilt; but his last words were: *Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat*. He was 60--70 years old, was a painter, well regarded in many places because he was a singer and a poet. He had also composed ballads in honor of the most holy Virgin, and thus had become valuable to many. But whenever he had sung a holy song, he had always doffed his little cap at the end and said: With the permission of my Lord. Some had attested to this; I do not know what there was to it. Six men, among them Knight Robert le Fosne, governor of Arras, and seven women, among whom again several joy-girls, were immediately arrested in Arras. But the matter now soon spread elsewhere as well.

In Amiens, on the basis of the statements in Arras, several were likewise taken into custody; but the bishop let them go, and said: he would do the same with all of them; for he did not believe that they did or could do what they said. In Tournai, likewise, 3--4 persons had been locked up; Master Jehan Taincture, doctor of theology, wrote on this occasion a good treatise on the Waldensians, which I, however, have not seen. The prisoners were released after some imprisonment. In Arras, meanwhile, proceedings had continued; two of the richest men of the city had had to wander into the bishop's prisons; finally, Payen de Beaufort, a noble knight, one of the old bannerets of Artois, about 72 years old, was also seized. He had been warned earlier, but he had answered: and even if he were a thousand leagues away, he would come to answer for himself; he feared nothing on that account. \[Page 375\]

He had come to Arras; his kin had adjured him, if he knew himself guilty, to withdraw. But he had sworn the most solemn oath, and consigned his soul to damnation if he knew what Waldensianism was, and had taken part in it. Yet he was arrested on that same day, and wished to be led to the Count of Estampes; but the latter refused to hear him, and had him taken to the episcopal prisons. Jacques Guillemeau, his brother-in-law, who was accustomed to heal fevers with incantations, when he visited him there, was likewise detained as an accused. Meanwhile, the trial of three men and double that number of women had been completed; on the scaffold their deeds were likewise recounted to them, which this time consisted in practiced lust with the demon.

All questioned, they confessed the truth of these accusations, except for one of the women, who denied everything. Two, who had steadfastly persisted in their initial confession without wavering, were sentenced to imprisonment; all the others, led to the stake, died---as much as one could see---in Christian composure, but persistently denying all participation. Again, A. Sacquespée, one of the richest citizens and aldermen of Arras, and two others were brought in. Martin Cornille, receiver of the county, and Willaume Le Febvre, a rich man, fled, and were pursued by the count as far as Paris. M. Anton had earlier replied to the urging of his friends to flee in the same way as the knight of Beaufort. The count, for the interrogation of the new prisoners, had further strengthened the commission by adding new members; among them was Philipp H. von Savinses, a strict man in these matters; also the Duke of Burgundy had attached his confessor, the Bishop of Salins, an eighty-year-old man, and Baldwin, knight of Nogent-lès, governor of Péronne. Two others were now taken into custody, and Arras thereby became so notorious in all of France and elsewhere that the merchants lost their credit, and no one would receive travelers from there in the inns.

No person dared to leave the city either, out of fear of being seized as a Waldensian; indeed, the people, as soon as anyone so much as stirred, immediately accused him of Waldensianism. The Vicars therefore made it known: no one should have fear, for no one would be arrested who had not been seen by 8--10 witnesses; although it was later learned that it had indeed happened on the testimony of 2--3. The Vicars now invited the fugitives to present themselves in person and to give account and answer to the charges laid against them.

Thereupon appeared Wilhelm Le Febore, the son of one of them, with a notary from Paris, early in the morning before Jean Pochon, one of the same, in the church, and appealed against them in the name of his father. After the protestation had been made, both mounted up and rode to Paris; where his father surrendered himself into custody in order to answer the charges of the Vicars. But they were overtaken by the men of the Vicars and brought into custody; a fate that many of their friends shared with them, those who had known of their intention. They were first released only after they had renounced their appeal, but the fugitives were excommunicated as Waldensians.

Messengers had been sent to Amiens for more clerics and their counsel on behalf of the Lord of Beaufort and Master Anton; but no one came except Master Martin and the Inquisitor of Tournay; the others excused themselves on account of their age and other circumstances. \[Page 376\]

But it was said: the matter, hitherto unheard of, seemed to them grave and weighty; for out of 100 people, in and outside Arras, not one, it was said, believed that the accused had taken part in the Waldensian rites and actually carried out what they had confessed. The Vicars therefore turned, in accordance with the request of the prisoners, to Philip, Duke of Burgundy, in Brussels, for counsel on what they should do in the matter. He summoned from the University of Louvain the most eminent and renowned teachers, as well as from all over the land.

To them were laid out the processes of both those who had confessed and those who had not; for there were some who did not confess, no matter what was done to them. What they judged, I have not seen; but it was said: they had been very much at odds. Some had opined: the Waldensian rites were not real; others had held them to be a pure illusion, and judged that the people believed they were doing what they did not in fact accomplish. Others said in turn: it was all reality; they entered into it body and soul, and whoever once surrendered himself to the enemy permitted him all power over himself.

The Vicars now took their leave of the Duke, who gave them with him Toison d'Or, his chief herald, in whom he placed all his trust, to be present at the interrogations. For although those from Paris and elsewhere said: he was having the rich people arrested in order to seize their possessions; he nevertheless wanted to know exactly what the truth of the matter was, in order to decree what was necessary.

On 14 August 1460 they returned to Arras; and whatever the counsel of the legal experts may have been, from that time on no one was arrested any longer on the charge of Waldensianism, although countless people were still accused; the prisoners were also treated better, and up to September only 4 processes were decided, and laid before the Duke and his legal experts in Brussels.

In the meantime, papal bulls, procured through the fugitive Martin Cornille, were brought in; by which Pope Pius transferred to the Dean Carlier of Cambrai, Gregory Nicolat, canon and official there, and the two Vicars of Arras, Pierre du Hamel and Master Jehan Thienbaut, the right to pass judgment in such matters.

About that time in Mantes, Noel Ferre from Amiens was burned, who had testified much against those of Arras; and how he had been at the assembly where the burning of the town of Pernes had been resolved.

On 12 October the delegates from Brussels returned, with them Master Adrian Collin, president of the chamber of the Duke of Burgundy in Douai; before whom the prisoners were interrogated once more.

The vicars now assembled many clerics and laymen, laid the records before them, and on the following day pronounced the judgment over Beauffort, Tacquet, Cariens, and Aubry. Before an innumerable crowd that had gathered from a radius of ten hours' journey, the accused appeared with the mitre on the scaffold. The Inquisitor of Cambrai now first charged Beauffort: how he, persuaded by evil women from the fellowship, had himself carried on the anointed staff to the Waldensians; how he had paid homage to the demon there, but instead of his soul had given him only four hairs from his head; how he had then kissed the paw of the ape, and recognized an unnamed woman. He had been twice more in the assembly, and had heard the devil preach: how men had no other souls than the beasts, and when they died, all was dead; and how he had let himself be forbidden by him the church and all churchly things. \[Page 377\]

He then asked the defendant: whether it was not all so? To which this one loudly and clearly said, "Fa!" and begged for mercy. Since Beauffort was without mitre, the speaker thereupon explained to the people: he owed it to the circumstance that he had confessed everything without torture, and never recanted. Tacquet, as he then continued, had taken part more than ten times, had consigned his soul, had promised never to betray one from the sect, and if he did so, driven by torture, to recant it before death. Cariens had moreover killed four children, from whom the salve had been prepared, and the harmful powders. Asked: whether it was not all true? he had replied: everything he had just spoken was nothing; as for what he had confessed, he had been forced to it by torture.

Hugnet, the fourth in the row, had nine witnesses against him; but whatever torture had been inflicted on him, he had always denied it, and even now, when grace was offered him if he confessed, he had replied: he knew nothing, and recognized nothing. He had, as it was said, been put to the torture more than fifteen times, sometimes twice in one day; he had been led to a nearby castle, and told: he should be forthwith beheaded if he did not confess; he had only repeated what had already been said. Once at nighttime he had attempted to flee from the prison, but had been recaptured; and that was counted against him as guilt.

Beauffort was now declared a heretic, apostate, and idolater, and sentenced accordingly to seven years' imprisonment; however, he was to be publicly scourged on the shoulders with rods while clothed. He was further to pay 5,000 gold thalers, of which 76 made a fine mark, into the alms box at Mechelen for the war, and smaller sums to named hospitals and church foundations. Tacquet was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, to scourging, and to smaller fines. Cariens, who had already earlier been under investigation for the faith, and in whom no sign of repentance had become visible, was handed over to the secular sword. Huguet, who heard his judgment kneeling and weeping, was condemned to twenty years' confinement on water and bread.

Yet the rumor ran: he had, as a former servant of the bishop, been much favored by the vicars. Many said: there were so many Waldensians in the church, at the courts of the powerful, and elsewhere, that it was a wonder. It was also believed that the Antichrist had already been born; he would soon rule, and all Waldensians would form his following. Yet in Paris, Amiens, Tournai many had been arrested, men and women, but released again without harm being done to them. Cariens was burned, but beforehand declared all innocent upon whom he had testified. The vicars now set free all those who had not been brought to confession by torture, twelve in number.

Against all of them witnesses had testified; they were interrogated under torture, some so often and severely that they were crippled; but they had persistently denied. They had to, before being released, swear their innocence on the Gospels; and for this, bring forward 4---5---7 honorable witnesses who likewise swore to their belief in the accused's innocence. They then still had to pay the court costs, and were mostly banished from the county. Only the Inquisitor P. le Broussart and the vicars of the bishop handled these releases; none of the others who were present at the interrogations took part in them, or were called upon to do so. \[Page 378\]

Martin Cornille, who had fled but now sat in the prisons of the Archbishop of Besançon, was now absolved by them from the excommunication that they had issued against him. A song that was found on the streets now harshly assailed the authors of the persecution. But on the following 16th of January 1402, a court messenger of the Parliament of Paris appeared in Arras to inquire into the injustice that had been done to the lord of Beaufort, as he had entered a complaint; as indeed Tacquet and others had also submitted complaints on this account; and also to make inquiry into the appeal that Beaufort had lodged with the Parliament before his interrogation.

Philip, his son, had brought the messenger there; both now went, along with the other three brothers and 30 friends, well armed to the vicars; and since these out of fear did not show themselves, the court messenger demanded the keys to the dungeon; and since the jailer refused them, he took them by force, freed the lord of Beaufort, and summoned the vicars to the 25th of February as the day on which they would have to stand to right before the Parliament in the matter of the appellant, whom he took with him to Paris. On the 1st, the vicars de Hamel and Thiebault betook themselves to Paris; but the matter was postponed, and they returned home. There they received letters from their bishop in Rome, who ordered: to set Huguet Aubry at liberty, which was accordingly done. Martin Cornille also returned, whom the Archbishop of Besançon, after some investigations, had set at liberty.

In June the matter of Beaufort was finally heard before the Parliament, and on this occasion M. J. de Popincourt, parliamentary advocate and legal counsel to the plaintiff, said in open session among other things: how, as often as a prisoner was brought in on account of Waldensianism, he was told: if he did not confess what was said to him, he would be burned; only in the case of an open confession would he be let off with a small pilgrimage. If he then refused this, he was put to the torture until he confessed whatever one wanted. He said further: when the lord of Beaufort was brought in, and had sworn against Dean du Bois that he had not been in the Waldensianism; the dean had knelt before him and most urgently begged him: to confess, otherwise no one could save him from death by fire and the confiscation of his property.

Pity for his children alone moved him to this urgent plea, the fulfillment of which would procure him his freedom again within four days. When he replied that he would then have sworn falsely, the dean countered: he would give him absolution. By this and by more he had then been induced to make his confessions. Later he had also been compelled to pay considerable sums to the Duke, the Count of Estampes, the Bailiff of Amiens and his lieutenant, without having been sentenced to do so. The Parliament pronounced the plaintiff free from the prison sentence imposed upon him, had the three still under arrest in Arras brought before its bar, and set them likewise at liberty.

Because of a fourth \[accused\], Le Febvre, witnesses were examined, and after he had cleared himself before the Archbishop of Reims and the Bishop of Paris, he too was likewise set at liberty. The same happened with the last of the imprisoned, Hotin Longs. Before this had taken place, the Dean of Arras, M. J. du Bois, while on a journey to Corbie, had been seized by a mental illness, and he had been brought to Paris as if out of his senses. He stood in the reputation of a good cleric, was still young, and many lamented him. \[Page 379\]

Others said again: it was God's punishment, because it had happened on his instigation that inquiry was made into the Waldensians, and some burned; he had also taken the most pains to prove the reality of the matter. Those who said this did not believe in the air-flight in this Waldensianism. Although he came to his senses again, there was yet no security in it, and he had to keep himself always in his chamber. Finally he became bedridden, and then his body opened in many wounds, and he had much to suffer. Some said in this connection: he had been poisoned or bewitched by the Waldensians. In February 1461 he died in full possession of his faculties, and certainly made a good end.

Meanwhile, in Burgundy, M. de Jehan, the Bishop of Barut, had been arrested in his birthplace, in order to learn from him what had actually determined him to stir up the matter with the Waldensianism in Arras. But soon he fled from this prison, and was, as he himself said, saved in a wonderful manner. He went to St. James in Galicia, and on the return from there he remained behind in France as confessor to the wife of Charles the Seventh. M. Paille, who had likewise taken part in the affair, withdrew from Arras to Paris; similarly Gilles Flameng to Douai; and it was said: it had been because they were all not gladly seen in Arras.

The process between the appellants, the heirs of the sixth of Beaufort and all those prosecuted on account of Waldensianism, and the defendants, the Duke of Burgundy and his ecclesiastical and secular judicial authorities, before the Parliament, meanwhile went its course. In the eighth year of King Charles VII, in the year 1491, the judgment was finally pronounced, which decided: that the said appellees had acted badly and abusively, had spoken, imprisoned, fined, proceeded, sentenced, and executed; and that the said appellants had rightly appealed. It then cassates all these processes, as well those conducted in the ecclesiastical as in the secular courts; the acts shall be torn up and destroyed, all made confiscations annulled and rendered void, the defendants personally condemned to make compensation, to the costs of the process, and moreover to a fine of 6500 Paris livres; of which 1500 francs shall be taken to establish a daily mass in perpetuity, for the souls' peace of the executed, in the cathedral of Arras; also a stone cross with an inscription shall be erected on the place of execution. The ecclesiastical courts of Arras were forbidden, in future processes, to make use of any extraordinary executions and cruel tortures. The sentence was solemnly proclaimed on the place of execution, a sermon held upon it, and on that day all work in the city had to be suspended.

One sees, this affair is just as instructive through its errors and blunders as the previous one was through justice, prudence, and thoroughness. Moreover, in order to pass a just and not hasty judgment upon it, we must first transport ourselves into the time in which it occurred. It was the middle of the fifteenth century, whose beginning had seen three popes at once on the chair and three emperors on the throne; only the outward expression for the weakening which the unity in church and state, amid the increasing power of multiplicity, had suffered in the wake of the earlier struggles between the two powers. \[Page 380\]

The ecclesiastical unity had fallen in Avignon into the power of French politics; that of the state in the emperor into that of the ever-increasing estates of the realm through constant encroachments; the consequence was a dissolution of the entire common and ecclesiastical order throughout all the European realms. In the church, therefore, the beginning of the newer heresies with Wycliffe and with Huss, and in their wake the Hussite wars. In the hierarchy, the disruption of the inner wholeness and cohesion, the rebellion of the members against one another and against the unity; at the councils of Constance and of Basel, the prelates and the lower priestly orders in strife. After the restoration of the see in Rome, constant struggles of its occupant with the unruly territorial nobility.

In the state, a similar dissolution of the old enclosed feudal state into its elements; the territorial lordship in conflict upward and downward, armed brotherhoods of equals against those higher and lower in rank, the struggle of feudal law with the public peace, of the old manner of warfare with the new, the gradual complete dissolution of the central authority. Between England and France in particular the great, centuries-long struggles over the succession, and in their train the great civil wars in both feudal states, that of the white and the red rose in England, Burgundy and the overlord in France; in both realms at last the unity, with the Tudors and Louis XI, triumphing everywhere; the world traversed by condottieri, Armagnacs, Landsknechts, black mercenaries; brazen outrage, violence, the impotence of the administration of justice prevailing throughout all Christendom.

In the wake of this fermenting dissolution of all elements of civil order and the prevailing savagery, then the greatest immorality; Venus the wandering strumpet dug out as the first among all the gods of heathendom; all cities filled with courtesans, even at the church assembly of Constance an incredible number of them, in the city where it had taken its seat; as Nider relates, on account of the presence of the many princes and their retinues, as well as the numerous craftsmen. In all this, France-ravaged Italy, standing closest to the contagion from the East in any case, going ahead with a good example; and out of the midst of this loathsome corruption, as the scourge of avenging Nemesis, the venereal disease developing itself. Added to this now the fall of the Greek emperorship, which had occurred beyond the straits.

Behind the storming Ottomans then at last Gog and Magog unleashed in Timur and the Mongols; Europe, and the sink of all vices in it, threatened with an inundation from the East, and these floods already breaking on the borders of Bavaria. Such was the state of European society at that time. Was it surprising, in this hopeless state of affairs, if serious minds came to the opinion: the world, now grown hoary with age and decrepit, was hastening toward imminent dissolution; the time was approaching that had been foretold by earlier prophets who had foreseen their agony in visions, and now it was inclining toward the end.

Had Christianity visibly lost its power, while the power of evil had strengthened itself everywhere; then the time of the Antichrist had arrived, to whom dominion was given for two times and half a time, and who should unite and assemble all his own under his sign. He was already born, this adversary; all signs seemed to proclaim his nearness, and the people believed, as we have seen, in his presence. What the coming times should behold in the light of day must now prepare itself in the veil of night; there he must recognize his own, enter them in his registers, and exercise them in all villainy. \[Page 381\]

At the courts he had begun this work of his; from there he had proceeded to the aristocracy; what de Rais had practiced in Brittany, what Lady Fowlis had practiced in Scotland, had not remained unknown; what had occurred in Avignon in the vicinity of the Prince of the Church, what doctrines had gained entry into the College of Cardinals, and what morals had arisen from them, which had later even raised Alexander VI to the throne: all of this had remained no secret; Master Jehan, Bishop of Barut, had seen it all quite close at hand as Grand Penitentiary. It was no wonder, then, that what had earlier circulated concerning immediate pacts of men with the demon, what had haunted here and there in the licentiousness of the age that recoiled before no crime, that it, heaped up and multiplied, should suddenly coalesce in anxious minds into the dread image of the Waldensians or Vauderie.

To the Bishop of Barut was joined the dean, M. Jacques du Bois, at that time a man of twenty-four years, of good repute, of whom that threatening song itself spoke: "Chascun cuidoit que iu keusses prophète, --- Sage comme un Salomon ou Sibille; --- Mais si du sens quy oneq feust en ta leste, --- tu a voulu semer une tempeste, --- tu beueras ton brassin ei brouct; --- Er sy seras des premiers à la feste. --- Folie fait quy folie com met."

Both, studying the Apocalypse in the course of the world at that time, may long since have arrived at the suspicion of a secret connection between a part of it and the demon; the ever-increasing audacity in crime of the century must have confirmed them in it more and more. Now had come the deposition of Robinet de Vaulx, born in Artois, who had testified against the Demoiselle and the Abbé la Vitte, the former a Sister of Joy, the latter---as it appears---a brother more than merely merry; and the word Vauderie, which at the surprising confusion immediately brought to their minds the Manichaeans, the worshippers of the demon, had been acknowledged by the Demoiselle at her arrest. Now they had found the trail, which they needed only to follow in order to find their view confirmed all too fully.

That the hermit had probably made his deposition under torture could, given the reverence that this faithless instrument---which the ecclesiastical courts should never have accepted---enjoyed at that time, by no means lead them astray. It was applied against the two prisoners as well; the gate of the secret had been burst open, and the mystery of iniquity now lay exposed before them. That a woman of the Vauderie, as the reporter says of her, and a frivolous cleric and wandering singer, designated by popular wit with the mocking name "de peu de sens," were little suited to serve, in a matter of such weight involving life and death, as foundational witnesses, had not occurred to them. If doubts arose in them, the torture, applied also against other arrested persons, immediately dispersed them. \[Page 382\]

If suspicion fell upon the instrument, then voluntary confessions appeared, either tricked out by promises, or also---since the matter lay in the intentions of many at that time and surely lacked not all foundation---here and there called forth by remorse, or also brought about by the simplicity of the afflicted in order to save themselves, coming in to pacify; and they found support again in the general belief around them. The surprise on account of the discovery made was, it seemed, so great that immediately the spectral image of the pact with all its terrors stood before them: how it possessed a third of the human race, how bishops and cardinals belonged to it, princes without doubt as well, and how only the Mighty One was still lacking to it, in order at its head to carry out all the plans of the abyss.

Since the poor testimony given by the Veltnerin was joined by that of the witnesses brought forward by her, who had been in Waldensia---a testimony which, even if given voluntarily, could only ground a suspicion of innocence---; the error thereby increased, and it was firmly established: All must die who had been denounced by four such witnesses. Whoever spoke against the system thereby rendered himself suspect of the vice; and it was soon likewise considered proven that no one could be accused unless he had truly made himself guilty of it; for which reason the contradiction to an earlier confession, made in the face of the flames, must also be invalid, because the demon had driven him to it.

Thus there developed a system of terror, before which nothing could stand once it had come within its scope; and this reached its height in the delusion of M. Jehan, who believed he could already recognize guilt or innocence from the physiognomy. No age may deem itself entirely secure from the possibility of falling prey to such errors; and should the present one, in the consciousness of its enlightenment, harbor such presumption; then one might remind it only of that twofold doubled attack of the disease which has befallen it in our days. The first at that time, when the Jesuits were supposed to be regicides from bloodlust, corrupters of morals and custom through their discipline, state-endangering conspirators from habit, accumulators of wealth from insatiable greed.

The order knows how to recount how the fixed idea of the delirious patient played its tricks on it; and since the attack, the specific smell will not yet depart from the nose of the Jesuit-sniffers. For the second and third, the attack has returned in the Revolution, once in the heads of the terrorists, who have armed their political virtue-logic with the guillotine, and subsidiarily assigned fire and water as helpers to it; and on the other side in the opposite siren idea of their battle-victims and the higher estates: that all this had already long ago been prepared for them by the dying Templars, and carried forward through secret societies, come to outbreak only in our days. And when finally, fourthly, the demagogic machinations emerged, how far, one believes, might this mania also have led, which could by no means lack defensible grounds, if torture had been at the disposal of those seized by it? All these examples show how dangerous it is for men, most dangerous for those who are of good will in it, to engage in such treasure-hunting in the depths of the human world of thought, in which God alone knows the way. \[Page 383\]

In the present matter of the Waldenses, it was the preserving instinct which, in the opposition of the vicars against this terroristic doctrine, first made itself felt; but the strict observance then still overcame the mildness. That emerged again in the opposition of the chapter lords of Cambrai and several bishops, but could likewise not make itself felt against the first zeal. Only the council of the prudhommes of Duke Philip of Burgundy in Brussels brought about a turning point. That the investigators had been sincere was proven by the circumstance: that they extended the investigation, without distinction, to the poor as well as to the rich and powerful; but that also brought about a swift conclusion to the matter. The Parliament of Paris took an interest in the affair.

The thirty years which the process lasted are filled, to a great part, with the perfidious, violent, but snake-cunning government of Louis XI and the fall of the House of Burgundy, and the death of Charles of Lorraine; circumstances which, as can scarcely be doubted, exerted their influence on the course of the legal proceedings. But as it has ever been in such matters, the Parliament has judged rightly, and Nemesis has not neglected to collect the debt fallen due to her.

For however little the age may have esteemed blood in its feuds and struggles, the shed blood cries out to heaven and demands its atonement. Not the mercy that leads man in good disposition toward a good end justifies him alone; if he does not cooperate in right strength, held in right measure: then he remains bound to it, and must atone for its neglect as for its excess, as du Bois has paid the debt with the darkening of his spirit. 1) Du Clercq relates among other things on p. 201: Robert le Bougre, who had been Bailiff of Amiens, during his term of office had 1900 and more either beheaded or drowned. It was the time of the Burgundian-French wars, and it sufficed already that one called the individual an Armagnac, in order to bring about his death.

#### C. The Witch Trials in and after the Time of the Reformation.

Amid such uncertain groping about after the truth and what was rightful in this matter, the Malleus maleficarum had also emerged; a book pure and blameless in its intentions, but composed on an insufficient basis of actual experience; not always carried out with sharpened judgment, and therefore often incautiously tipping over to the sharp side. The book had, however, scarcely had time to penetrate into the mass of ideas, when the sixteenth century broke in, and the Germanic fury brought about a new catastrophe and an ecclesiastical uprising.

The mass of democratic forces and opinions had for a long time already accumulated excessively in Germany, and while the old faith, against which they had risen with might, found its support in the unity of the Empire and the spiritual princes; the uprising one had spread itself in the worldly princes, in the aristocracies, in the burgher estate of the imperial cities, and in the peasant estate striving after emancipation, in the corruption of the clergy and the critique of the humanists. The still weak and unfortified one had, in the confusions of the great war between Charles V and Francis I over Italy, in which all Europe had taken part, found its protection; the other princes' wars, nobles' wars, cities' wars, and peasants' wars had episodically inserted themselves into the great European conflict; until at last in the Religious Peace the middle power, between the higher unity and the lower democratic tendencies crossing through it, carried off all the advantage alone, and divided the territorial sovereignty of the Emperor's simple crown and the Pope's threefold crown between itself. \[Page 384\]

In England the whole movement had been incited by the despotism of the Tudors, also entirely exploited in its interest, and in the laying aside of the oath of supremacy the worldly power had taken over the homage of the spiritual; as in the North a new dynasty had bought itself in with the sacrifice of the Church. In France likewise it is the directions fighting against unity that, mastering the spiritual movement, find their heads in the court parties of the Bourbons and the Valois, their leaders in the nobility, their fighters in the cities, and now set the municipal league of the Huguenots against the League of the Guises, and thus nearly fill the last half of the century with a civil war that finally there also ends with the victory of unity in the return of the leader of the Bourbons to the Church; while simultaneously the struggles in the wake of the revolt of the Netherlands are fought out, which lead to the victory of unity on the one side and to that of the opposition in the other half. As the result of the secular strife, therefore, everywhere the worldly power victorious, and indeed in the form of territorial sovereignty, and even in the two peninsulas of Italy and Spain, where the movement had remained nearly entirely without effect, this only achieved through the earlier gained predominance of this power.

Protestantism declared the old church, as it stood opposed to it, a work of the devil, and its head the Antichrist, but Rome the beast with the seven heads. Satan was thus indispensable to the new doctrine, indeed his power, which has proven itself so victoriously in the greatest part of modern history, had increased considerably in splendor and reputation; for he had also gained territorial sovereignty in the south of Europe. Had it followed the opinion of the founders of the doctrine, then the new age would have followed the example of the older one. At that time, when the divine race of Zeus followed that of the Uranions around Cronus in rule; then Cronus with the Titans was locked in Tartarus, so that the defeated old time in its horror might hold its death-sleep.

The church triumphing in the saints would then have become such a Christian Tartarus; but the militant church, gathered around its head, a Sabbath celebrated in broad daylight on the seven hills and in the choir of every church. But the power that directs the fates of the times was not in agreement with this doctrine of the zealots, the heaven of the saints was not banished into the shadows of the underworld; the church maintained itself in the daylight, and in the north only a counter-church was built upon bodily discipline.

Thus the members of this counter-church had to content themselves with explaining all higher mysticism in the other as a deception of the demon, and thus to him, who before and after remained in possession of all areas of possession and sorcery, now also to concede all the higher mystical regions previously kept pure from him. Hence there could be no question of stopping the heresy process in Protestant Europe; rather it received a new impetus, and began to spread in proliferating drive. The world, which emerged victoriously from the struggle of the century, as it has handed everything over to territorial sovereignty, had also completely secularized this process; and as it took away from the church the instruction in matters of heresies for easily comprehensible reasons, so also the magic matters were entirely referred to the secular courts. \[Page 385\]

Hence now the parliamentary acts of Henry VIII against conjuration, heresy, and sorcery from the year 1541; of Elizabeth from the years 1559 and 1562, sharpened at the beginning of the following century. The last act of the ninth parliament of Queen Mary of Scotland imposes the death penalty on sorcery and those consulted for advice; and now there too the legal disputes, which had previously been very rare, arise in multitude; and it shows that thereby the practitioners of lower standing appear placed in a relation of clientele and patronage to the powerful ones. So the Protestants in the north; the Catholics in the south, among whom likewise the state has more or less triumphed, gradually followed the given example, and the secularization of the whole process occurred also among them gradually everywhere.

The Bamberg criminal court ordinance of the year 1510 already sharply distinguishes between what in these mixed matters belongs to the spiritual and the secular court; and in the 121st article it ordains: the sorcerers who have harmed others to be burned like heretics, but over all others to bring in the jurists; since the vice of sorcery in general belongs before the secular judge. Since the Carolina followed this ordinance, it has remained so in it; and it has only wisely added the prohibition of the inquisition based on the statements of the sorcerers.

Since in such a way the jurisdiction has entirely fallen to the secular authorities, we must not wonder to see them personally take part in the investigations, especially when the magic has turned against themselves. That was especially the case with James I in the year 1591.

At that strange witches' conspiracy which had formed against him, he took great pleasure in being personally present at all the investigations and proceedings. The main figure in the whole affair was Cunningham, usually called Dr. Fian in the records, a schoolmaster near Tranent; as it appears, a dissolute man, but, as emerged, one of great strength of soul and firm nerves. The knotted cord was first placed around his head, and he confessed nothing; gentle persuasion led equally little to the goal; finally the Spanish boots were applied to him, and when, after three tightenings, pressure was brought to bear for a confession, his tongue failed him. Later he signed a confession in which he admitted guilt for directing witchcraft against the king and uncovered the scandals of his life. But in the following night the apparently penitent man attempted to escape, was indeed recaptured, but now sought to deny everything previously confessed.

James, in view of his stubborn obstinacy, devised a new torture himself: the nails were torn from him with pincers, and under each two needles were driven in up to their heads. But amid these pains he did not flinch, and confessed nothing; the boots were applied to him again, and drawn so tightly that the legs burst and blood and marrow spurted out, so that they were crippled forever. However it may have gone with his confession, it agreed in all circumstances with that of Agnes Sampson, whom Spottiswoode describes as a worthy, truthful matron in her statements, and who had declared herself a witch. From Janet Bowman's pyre in the year 1572 to the end of James's reign, another 35 witch trials up to 1625 are recorded in the records of the court, and Archbishop Spotswood relates that the greater part of the winter was always spent on the instruction of these processes. \[Page 386\]

Even Knox had been accused of such arts, which allegedly made his secretary delirious. The Lord Chief Justice of Scotland, Sir Lewis Bellenden, had died of fright from an appearance of the conjured demon; and on account of this James in 1597 had taken occasion, in a parliamentary act, to regulate the forms of the witch trial. In the preface to his Daemonologie he says: his conscience had compelled him to write the book against the Sadducees Scot and Wier from the devil's school. He rejects, however, the possibility of witches slipping through narrow openings, because this is connected with the transubstantiation of the papists. But in the second book, chapter 7, he says: there had indeed been more ghosts in popery (probably on account of purgatory), of which nothing more was known after the Reformation; but in compensation the devilish power of witches had become far more manifest, which he could prove by experience in Great Britain. In fact, these processes now also increased in England with rushing speed. Thus the demonic conspiracy against Elizabeth in the year 1570, the Countess of Lennox's case, the trial of Alice in 1575; that of the Windsor witches, the 17 or 18 who were condemned to the fire at St. Osyth in Essex; that of Mother Style, the other at Cambridge, those of the Warboys witches, and others.

On the continent meanwhile the courts had not been idle either. At the beginning of the century the blind man from the Quinze-Vingts in Paris was hanged with several others for sorcery, and testified to 150 accomplices. Trial of the three werewolves in Besançon 1521. In the year 1556 four hundred burned in Toulouse according to Petrus Tholosanus; as it seems, as a prelude to the civil religious wars that broke out a few years later and filled the rest of the century.

Now ever-increasing multiplication of witchcraft. In the year 1571, the death of Trois-Echelles on the Grèveplatz, and his confessions regarding the number of initiates in the presence of Admiral Coligny. The werewolf Garnier at the court of Dole. After the death of Charles IX, the proceedings sharpened. Trial of J. Harvilliers. 1582, trial of de la Rue for witch's knots. Decrees of the councils thereon and against all sorcery. 1584, the 14 accused thereof by the Parliament of Paris, then in Tours, acquitted on the report of the physicians!).

In Bosdau, who voluntarily, and without any torture, before the court of Bordeaux confessed the Sabbath and his participation therein. Around this time, toward the end of the civil wars, Florimond de Rémond, councilor of parliament at this court, says that the vice of sorcery had become so common in these wretched times that the parliamentary prisons could not hold all the prisoners, nor did the judges have time enough to interrogate them. Their judges' benches were daily stained with blood, and they left the court always with sorrow and dismay over the terrible and horrifying things that the statements of the witches revealed.

The book of Bodin, De la Démonomanie des sorciers, 1570, contains a part of the results of these and the earlier investigations. At the same time, Remy in Lorraine executed from 1580--1595, thus within fifteen years, 900; and his three books De Daemonolatreia give account of what he learned at their interrogations. A few years later comes the mission of de Lancre to Labourd in the Basque country, where many thousands were found afflicted with the evil. These were the consequences of the desolation of a century, in its first half filled by the ambition of its kings in foreign wars, and in its other by the religious disputes with a chain of eight civil wars, raging longer than 30 years. \[Page 387\]

Christian Rome had, and by no means without its own complicity, in the first of these wars, experienced a plundering by the descendants of the same peoples who formerly carried out the judgment of God against the earlier world tyranny; the Blood Wedding had marked the middle of the second. With the Catholicism of strict observance, as the League knew it, the Calvinism of the Huguenots had contended in all its harshness, and had opposed to it the denial of all mysteries, and in their place the doctrine of predestination; and all the poison that had developed in the black bands and their hangers-on had attached itself to this strife, which must shake every conviction to its deepest foundations.

The people, terrified, plundered by the lawless robbers, in constant distress, became astray in their faith, and turned rather to him who seemed to be the lord and master of these wild times. Many of the Basque witches confessed to de Lancre: they had always believed that the worship of the devil was the best religion; for the mass was read at the Sabbath with greater pomp than on the day, and there was nothing evil in attending them. Moreover, Satan had made them believe: that he was the true God, but the Sabbath his paradise; and the joy one enjoyed there only a foretaste of the higher joy in that world!). One sees, they had fled only from the misery of the actual present into the pleasure of this perverted ecstasy; without thinking more closely about the consequences of this flight. Thus the evil that the wantonness of the higher classes had spread, carried about by the wild soldiery, had become epidemic in the misery of the people, and thus the judges encountered it in their investigations. In Germany meanwhile the events led to the same results. On the Lower Rhine the revolt of the Netherlands against Spanish rule had broken out.

Protestantism had fled from France, now seeking from there to spread upstream through the ecclesiastical electorates, and for this purpose had found in Gebhard of Cologne a suitable instrument. All the lands round about, where the war raged, suffered most terribly under the plundering lust of the warring armies; not only the Dutch filled everything they could with robbery and arson; the Spaniards too, amid the dissolution of all discipline, plundered the Eifel and the neighborhood; the people nearly succumbed to misery and need, and grew savage in the most frightful manner.

The nineteen years of the reign of Elector Johann VI of Trier were, moreover---excepting only the years 1584 and 1590---years of unfruitfulness, of high prices, and of hunger; countless refugees increased the distress still further, and the plague soon made its appearance to clear things away. The people were in despair, and attributed their misery and the unfruitfulness of the years to evil arts and to the witch-folk. In the officials of the time, among whom the distress now also awakened gold-greed, they found all too willing help to render this their belief pernicious to many. Through the whole diocese, all cities and villages, there now ran---as an eyewitness relates---accusers, inquisitors, judges, minions, and executioner's assistants, who seized all suspects and burned them in great numbers; for scarcely one escaped who had once been accused. \[Page 388\]

Soon the terror spread also into the city of Trier, and soon spared not even the former blood-judges themselves; for Dietrich Flade, rector of the university and city schultheiss, who had led a great multitude of those unfortunates to the stake, was burned in 1586 according to the rules of his own judicial procedure. Him followed in death two mayors and several senators and judges. Canons of several chapters, pastors, rural deans had the same fate. In two villages at about the same time only two women remained; for the fury of the people and the madness of the judges had only ever increased; so that scarcely one remained whom suspicion had not struck. The notaries, the actuaries, and the innkeepers enriched themselves meanwhile; the executioner rode like a courtier on a high horse, clad in gold and silver; his wife vied in finery with the nobles.

The children of the condemned wandered forth, their goods were confiscated. There began to be a shortage of field hands and vinedressers; hence the unfruitfulness. Scarcely, men thought, had a worse plague ever raged in the archbishopric, or a madder foe wreaked havoc, than these trackers, who struck so many for whose innocence there was manifold likelihood. The persecution lasted several years; many of the superiors boasted of the multitude of pyres they had erected. Impoverishment was the consequence: now laws were given and enforced against the abomination, and now it died out, just as the war died out with the exhaustion of the money, so the fury of the witch-judges. In scarcely seven years, from 1587--93, 365 persons were burned from 20 villages near the city.

In all this the Antichrist was indeed present, although perhaps more in the judges than in the judged: and so men easily came to the belief that he must really and personally have been born. That introduced a new error into the matter. The exorcists, aware of their power in the obsessions brought about by magic, came upon the idea of making use of this power to compel the demon against his will to bear witness to the truth, and thus to spy out the secrets of his realm through himself.

For the first time, to our knowledge, use was made thereof in the matter of the Count of Gaftedy: Magdalena von Palnd, his betrothed, had, against his will and at the age of fourteen, entered the convent of the holy Ursula, and had placed herself under the obedience of Father Romillon, a former Calvinist. As she thereupon fell into a possession, the peace of the convent was suddenly disturbed thereby; for five of the sisters residing there soon found themselves likewise possessed. Among them was one in particular who was most affected by it, Louise Capelle, from the county of Avignon, likewise descended from heretical parents, originating in St. Remi, near that county; a simple, pious girl skilled in household tasks. Magdalena was for a long time unsuccessfully exorcised in secret, but then taken to St. Baume, and there given over to continued exorcism to Father F. Dompt, a Fleming, Doctor of Theology at Louvain and a Dominican. With her had come Louise, to manage the household, who at that time was not yet suspected of possession; which, however, soon betrayed itself through tone and glance; while Magdalena, in her attacks, was repeatedly lifted into the air to tear her from the exorcist who held her. \[Page 389\]

On the eighth of December 1610, the spirits of Louise named themselves: first Verin the superior, and then Gressil and Sonnillon, his subordinates. On the day of the Conception of Mary, Verin began through her mouth to deliver a great eulogy of the blessed Virgin, concluding it thus: that he spoke not out of love for her, but compelled by fear of God, who is able to call forth all things from nothing. Catherine of France, an ecstatic sister, brought Magdalena there during this speech; and now Verin, upon beholding her, began to call out to the stronger demon who dwelt in the one present: "Though thou art my master, yet one greater than thou wills that I now speak in thy presence."

Then this one rose up raging in Magdalena, bellowed like a bull, and threw her shoe at the speaker's head. But Verin continued to deliver to her an eloquent exhortation to repentance and renunciation of the evil one, which closed with the exclamation: "Wonder, unheard-of wonder, that the devil himself saves souls, and serves them as physician and surgeon!" Magdalena, who might have seen collusion and deceit in this scene, remained unmoved; the bystanders prayed the Psalms for her, and this seemed to bend her hardened spirit. She burst into tears, and throwing herself down before the others, declared herself a perverse and wretched creature.

Now the ice was broken, and the work of conversion proceeded on its course. Verin pursued it with great insistent eloquence; and one of the possessed laid to heart for the other everything that could possibly be helpful to snatch her from the power she had hitherto served and lead her back to heaven. When the priest offered the Eucharist to both possessed ones with the words: "Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi!", the spirit cried out from Magdalena: "Well for you a lamb, for us a roaring lion!" When the priest commanded him to adore his God, he replied: "What, should I adore this God, this God should I adore? I will not do it, I shall never do it, in defiance of thee, O Christ; in mockery of thee, O Mary, and of thee, O Magdalena, who art mine!" Verin now cried: "Ha, wretch, accursed one, like me! Thou hast no power over Magdalena, who will take the Lord as her bridegroom." "No," screamed the other, "she is my bride, and I will prove it."

So the spirits quarreled with one another; but the one belonging to the neophyte always drew the shorter end, yet avenged itself on her by from time to time calling forth the most violent paroxysms: it threw her to the ground, stirred up the most furious convulsions in her, and made known to the whole world through her mouth her most secret sins, which only her confessors knew, and at night it plagued her with incubi. Meanwhile Verrin continued his instruction in the Christian doctrine; at every section confirming the truth of what was said with a solemn oath. He held before her how she had three times renounced her God, who now might yet have mercy on her soul: O Magdalena! if the stars of the firmament could express thanks, if the leaves of the trees could understand these words, if the stones of St. Baume had a voice, they would all praise God for it; for your sins are many, like the sand on the sea. The hard heart of the sinner slowly softened; she had frequent relapses into impatience and despair; terrifying visions frightened her sorely; the demonically ecstatic girl did not cease, with great eloquence, to press upon her again and again. \[Page 390\]

Now she confessed herself once more before all those present, who had come streaming together from far and wide, as a sinner worthy of hell; and she laid herself down before the church door, begging the passersby to trample her as the most wretched creature with their feet. She now gave the signs on her body, one of which proved visible upon examination; and during the exorcism a number of spirits went out from her, though this did not lift her obsession; just as with Louise, after the departure of the two lower ones, Verrin had remained behind. Her torments returned in between with renewed strength; she was lifted up high by the demon, she lost---especially when she wanted to go to confession---often her sight and hearing for several days; imagination and memory were often bound to her, her whole body sometimes swelled up; her eyes became like burning lamps, distortions ran over her face, and for 15 days Asmodeus defiled her every evening under the exorcism, by calling forth the most obscene movements in her, during which she always believed she saw Louis Gaufredi.

During these proceedings, Verrin had testified several times: that it was Louis Gaufredi, at the church of the Accoules in Marseille, who had seduced Magdalena; that he had made her renounce her baptism and her share in paradise; that he had given her the demon, and possessed her handwriting. He had cried out like one in despair that the living God forced him to this testimony, and he swore: that everything he had said was true, and he had laid a solemn oath upon the altar sacrament thereon. The priests, who had been witnesses to this, had remembered the church precept: to warn the sinning brother three times, and therefore had him admonished three times.

Once it had happened orally through Brother Franciscus; then in writing through a more urgent letter, which they wrote to him as eyewitnesses and earwitnesses of the oath, and in which they promised him that if he came to St. Baume and there converted himself in quiet; then his sins should remain hidden, as if he had laid them down in the confessional. In the third, they had urged the Capuchins in Marseille to send three of their own with the guardian, and to bring the final admonition in a second letter to him. But the Capuchins did not want to involve themselves in this matter without prior consultation with Father Michaelis; all the less so, since the demon from another possessed woman in Aix had said and sworn: that Gaufredi was no sorcerer, and that Magdalena was not afflicted by any malevolent spell.; which Verin immediately declared to be a cunning trick of Lucifer, and the spirit of Magdalena confirmed it.

Verin, for his part, now allowed himself to be commanded by the exorcist to go himself to Marseille for the conversion of the sinner, and Louise felt that he departed from her like a wind; she truly remained free of him in his absence, however with the feeling of pain from the maleficium. Thus he went a second, third, and fourth time, always fruitlessly, and on that account broke forth into curses against him: because he surpassed all sorcerers in wickedness, therefore he was the head of all sabbaths. Cain and Judas were innocent in comparison to him, and the demons themselves were of the opinion that hell was not sufficient to punish him. He had abjured God and all angels and saints; now God made use of that to which he alone had not abjured, namely the demon, in order to convert him. The time of the last and worst heresy had come; all of France was already infected by it. \[Page 391\]

Meanwhile, Gaufredy had nevertheless resolved to go to St. Baume in the company of two Capuchins and Father Michaelis, and he arrived there on the evening of the 21st of December. It was decided to leave the exorcism of Louise to him, and Father Michaelis delegated his authority to him for that purpose. Verin began with a prayer in which he most urgently and heartily besought the Lord for grace for him; which moved the hearts of many, but did not please others, who believed that he should not be allowed to speak, and that he must be interrupted. But he continued and asked his exorcist Gaufredy: Is God almighty or not? The one questioned replied: This one is almighty. Then the other asked: Has the Church the power to command the demons? He answered: She has this power. Then he posed the third question: whether the demons could be compelled to tell the truth, and whether the oaths of the demons, sworn in all form and solemnity, were valid or not? He answered: They are valid, and God can compel the demon to tell the truth. Verin now said: Take good note of what he has admitted; but turning to him: Then exorcise me! It was done, and at the end Verin adjured him anew to renounce magic and to turn to God.

He then swore by the holy sacrament that all was true which he had said earlier, and Magdalena swore the same with a double oath. Then he said further that he must be guarded in St. Baume. The imprudent one had now ensnared himself; but on the following morning, dissension broke out among the clergy, which had already stirred earlier. Father Michaelis and the Capuchins excluded Father Romillon and the Dominican father Franciscus Dompt from their council, and in the course of the day the latter was told: he was proud, disobedient, ambitious, and striving after vain glory, and in all this sought only himself. Others judged again: he was all too credulous; still others judged differently.

Louise too was treated contemptuously, and Verin said that day to Father Romillon: she would follow another calling, and did not deserve this treatment. He also broke the silence imposed upon him against Father Michaelis. The Dominican father threw himself, in the presence of the other Capuchins, at the feet of Father Michaelis, and begged permission to return to his province, however not with complete humility: yet he wished to withdraw himself from the matter, because Father Michaelis would not listen to him, but rather to those who maintained: Verin must not be allowed to speak; Louise was not possessed, and the whole affair seemed more from the devil than from God. In this uncertainty they nevertheless continued; on the following evening Father Michaelis exorcised, Gaufredy renounced magic, and Verin said Amen. Later he cried: Adam, where art thou? Out of the depths call to God thy Lord, and he will hear thee!

He compared him, in the following days, when the struggle within him seemed to persist, to a man mortally ill who had lost his memory. He also said: the Antichrist had already been born, of a Jewess with an incubus; the magicians were his forerunners, and God wished to prepare His Church for the impending dangers. Meanwhile, Father Michaelis conducted tests with the two women, in order to convince himself and the councilors of the Parliament of Aix, who had taken cognizance of the matter, whether they were truly possessed. Berrin said on that occasion, when silence was imposed upon him: O Michaelis, God looses me, but you bind me. \[Page 392\]

Gaufridy meanwhile renounced his written pacts, but the spirits cried out: it was not earnest with him, and he was only playing the Pharisee; holy on the outside, full of filth within. He sharply rebuked the exorcists for demanding signs from him; he must indeed, as they said, be the Bridegroom of the Church, but she too must obey her Bridegroom, who had resolved to give her light through him; they, however, imposed silence upon him. When he caught sight of Gaufridy, he began to bark, like a dog in the presence of a wolf nearby, and announced to him: if within eight days his sincere conversion did not take place, he would be burned to ashes. They say Louise is bound in her imagination; but the earth would have to swallow her, and you would have to deliver her to the flames, if she were not possessed, and if she had not sworn those many oaths of her own accord.

Meanwhile, he always refused to speak in a foreign tongue; God would not have it, he would give no signs; for if he sent an archangel in his invisible form, they would say: it is the devil; but if in his visible form, it would be said: it is a man. On the tenth of January, finally, some of the more prominent men of Marseille came to St. Baume, in order to lead Gaufridy back to their city. Silence was imposed upon Verin, from the Dominican Alès what he had written was violently taken away, and he himself was arrested for a few hours; everything stood against him, and wherever he turned he encountered mocking words, scorn, humiliation; and they even threatened to have everything that had happened declared null and void, as if undone, by the synod and the Bishop of Marseille! Upon closer investigation, however---which ensued because the Parliament had taken the matter into its own hands---one convinced oneself of the women's real possession, and the papers were returned.

Thus what had begun in 1610 at St. Baume continued in 1613 in the Netherlands. There, in a newly founded Brigittine convent, the three nuns Francisca Bollineșia, Catharina Fourner, and Perona Imberta had fallen into obsession; and at the request of the bishop of the diocese, the provincial of the Dominicans had appointed the same Father Dompt as their exorcist, to whom a Minorite, Father F. Michaelis, was assigned as assistant. They betook themselves to the place; at first the spirits were rebellious, but in the end they were subdued, and unanimously testified to Maria of Sains as the originator of the malefice. When questioned, she denied everything; but when the spirit of one of them revealed that she bore the marks of the demon, she confessed and herself indicated the places of these marks. At first she had to be compelled to these confessions by exorcism, but soon she did so voluntarily. Besides the three, all the others in the convent likewise suffered various afflictions, and she had been the primary originator of all these evils; despite the extraordinary reputation for holiness in which she stood, suspicion had soon fallen upon her; she had been locked up, but at that time had confessed nothing. Now she revealed that she had brought it about through a double malefice, in order thereby to destroy the young foundation. \[Page 393\]

She confessed still countless other crimes of this sort; also how the exorcists had long since been well known to her, inasmuch as she had seen them in St. Baume, whither her demon Astaroth had carried her. We have already mentioned earlier what statements this resolute woman, who recoiled from no atrocity, had made; and how she herself had not shrunk from maltreating the Heavenly ones. While she continued unceasingly to make new confessions concerning the demons who obsessed her, she visited, according to her account, the Sabbath without interruption; and she always brought new signs with her, which the investigation conducted each time confirmed. Among other things, she also began to speak of the Antichrist, in which the three other demons assisted her. He was not begotten through man's agency, but through the demon; the earth had never produced a creature equal to him in wickedness. He travels through the air and performs signs and wonders. Maria de Sains knows him and has seen him in the synagogue, where he received baptism.

Now he is in his boyhood years; born in Babylon, raised in Capernaum in the land of Judea, he will one day rule the whole world from Jerusalem. But before his thirtieth year, he shall not be recognized in his full significance; then he shall reign a little over three years, and numerous heralds shall go before him. Beelzebub has declared him to be his son, and they call him Creator of Heaven and Earth, also Christ, King and Messiah. Gaufridy has administered baptism to him in his official capacity, Magdalena Palud and Maria de Sains were his godparents. Before his mother they kneel on the Sabbath, and say Ave etc., and she follows immediately in rank after the princes of the demons. She wallows in all prostitution, yet is called the Flower of Beauty.

On feast days he is brought to the Sabbath; there, said Marie, he kissed and embraced me and said: I was exceedingly beautiful, had beautiful smooth hair, and amiable and shining eyes; of all this he spoke like a grown man. Many will cling to him when he makes himself known, and everything that is written about him in the Apocalypse will be fulfilled. What now happens secretly among the sorcerers will then happen openly; nothing will be impossible to him, and his own will therefore believe him omnipotent. His sign will be the form of a goat; pressed upon the forehead among the more noble, upon the hand among the lowly. On the Sabbath they bring him, in celebration of his birthday, their gifts just as in the Epiphany to the Lord, and pay him homage thereby, and the prince of the magicians celebrates the day with three masses. \[Page 394\]

A half year before his birth, however, in the year 1609, a boy was born to Magdalena; begotten by Gaufridy, according to the opinion of most, so that he might become the forerunner of the Antichrist; his name is Adocucy: and more beautiful and lovable than he himself, he will be raised with him in the Orient. When the time has run its course, this one will rise up against the Church; more will believe in him than have believed in Christ; the Jews will see in him their Messiah; he will transplant all the torments of Hell to earth, and apply them against the Christians; all heresies long since extinguished will revive, and Rome will fall. In place of the destroyed churches he will build new synagogues for himself, and they will honor his image there as they do him himself, and sacrifice Christian children to him; but he will secretly worship Lucifer, who will be loosed in this time, in which all vices will count as virtues, and will be preached as such by the magicians. He will perform signs and wonders, raise the dead, heal the sick; his images will speak like living beings, but many martyrs will lose their lives in these times. To him as guardians and watchmen and companions, however, Maria de Sains has borne two boys, and the nun Simona two others; they are strong as Samson, powerful and noble above all others.

The Simona who is here in question, like Sains, born in the city of Lille, had entered with her into the local Brigitten Convent; her accomplice in all her schemes and intrigues, she had also accused herself of the same things simultaneously with her. Since she was still a novice, they had therefore taken away her habit for that reason; but during the year in which she was kept locked up in the bishop's prison, she had confessed nothing. She was then released at the urging of her superiors and relatives, and had gone to Valenciennes; where she hired herself out as a maid, and thereby kept her whereabouts completely hidden from everyone. A man from Lille had fallen in love with her there, and offered her his hand; she consented, but since she needed the consent of her superiors for it, he went to obtain it; with the prohibition, however, on her part, to reveal her whereabouts to anyone.

But he did not keep his secret to himself, it became known through the women; Father Domptius, who was very interested in questioning her likewise about these matters, brought about her arrest. On July 29, 1613, he came, accompanied by two commissioners assigned to him and Maria de Sains, to Valenciennes; where they visited the arrested woman, who, however, denied everything. Maria, meanwhile, insisted on her accusation; if this one were not a sorceress, there would be none in the world. She was confronted with her; but since she always persisted in her denial, they decided to call upon the possessed ones to speak. Simona, however, replied: they might come, she did not fear the devils. The possessed ones were called forth, and now the same play began as in St. Baume: Tevtathan spoke through the person of Perona and Maria and sought to bring her to confession, also urging the commissioners to apply torture; but although the three possessed ones testified against her with one voice, she remained unshaken. \[Page 395\]

Maria now indicated the locations of her marks with ink; she meanwhile kept crying out "Ah" and "Woe!" because she believed she was being examined; but when later actually probed, the indicated spots proved bloodless and insensible. When she objected: that when she herself had just examined one spot, blood had flowed, Maria, called in, said: "Last night you received a mark on your hand in the synagogue"; she indicated the spot, and it was found to be such. Great, eloquent apostrophes to the arrested woman now followed; but Simona was not moved by them. She said: she did not consider herself guilty of what they demanded of her; Maria replied, so it had been with her too, only when she had affirmed the questions had her memory returned. Simona answered: she would not say "yes" until she had true knowledge of what she was to affirm; all their speeches now appeared to her like dreams. Thereupon Maria: so it had often happened to her too; but the father had then asked her: whether her marks were likewise illusions? Maria tried many more means on her, confessing herself as the worst sinner; they brought Simona into a church and exorcised her at midnight, the hour of the Sabbath; the spirits joined in speaking, and swore vehemently; Simona remained unmoved.

On the following day Maria reported: the hour of the Sabbath had been shifted to three o'clock in the morning; both of them had been there, and Simona had brought three marks. They were found, exactly as she described, on the left arm. One of the possessed women now swore a solemn oath: that she was a sorceress, and now the same three questions were put to her as to Gaufridy. She affirmed all of them, yet maintained: the possessed one did not speak the truth regarding her, and finally said: she would no longer answer the spirits henceforth; when they had talked themselves out, they would fall silent of their own accord.

The demons now press upon the silent one, presenting to her: what God has done for her, how all the saints of heaven have interceded for her; how her hardness of heart, in thrusting away all this grace from herself, has infinitely heaped up the measure of her sins, and will finally, at the approaching downfall of the world, make her a child of perdition. This at last seemed to break her stubborn spirit, and she began to weep. All those present urged her on, she wept more violently; the Dominican placed the Sacrament upon her head, and still weeping she cried out: I will say no more, I say no more no!

The demon drew nearer to her and said: The eternal Father receives you, the Son pleads for you that he may receive you, all the saints unite their supplications. She, entirely dissolved in lamentations, said: I am a sorceress, truly I am such a one. The demon spoke through the mouth of the Perona: By this God who created the angels and cast us out, do you deny that I am Beelzebub, the prince of the demons, who has so often marked you? She replied: I know you, I say it with displeasure, God's power compels me to it. Now follow in sequence the confessions, during which the demons of the possessed assist her helpfully and refresh her memory; yet on the second day already, when asked if she persisted, she said: I dare not contradict, but if I agree, then everything seems to me like a dream; and it comes to me as if I were speaking lies. \[Page 396\]

In between, she herself gave signs on her body, confirmed the statements of the others regarding the manner of the Sabbath, regarding the birth of the Antichrist; she shared sermons that Beelzebub had delivered there; she censured the doctrines of Binsfeld with the saintly condemnations, and corrected the statements of this saint, whereby again the demons helped, and Simona and Maria sang Latin hymns of praise to the honor of God. Soon, however, Simona recanted everything that she had stated and confessed, point by point.

If one follows the course of all these strange events, one believes oneself transported into that Sibyl's cave: the Dominican carries the torch ahead, strangely the paths intertwine, everything seems fashioned below as it is fashioned above on the earth, the darkness lacks only the sun; column positions, bridges, towers, castles, human figures and animal shapes and palm canopies, all have formed themselves from the stalactite; all truth looks like lie, all lie like truth, for the inner confirming soul is not present. The women who move on this stage, if one does not, in the previously favored manner, declare them the dregs of worthlessness, and those who had dealings with them all together as selected fools, were truly possessed.

As regards Magdalena Palud first of all, the course of the story from January 11 onward, when the Parliament of Aix took up the matter, proved this her possession. The President du Bair, the councilors Thoron and Segniran, Calas and Thomassin the procurator, the most skilled jurists of their time, the physicians Fontaine, Merindol, Grassi, the anatomists and surgeons Bon-Temps and Pronet, likewise university professors, clerics in great number, belonging to various orders, inclined to differing opinions in this matter, had examined her condition, and had all at last agreed: that the phenomena observed in her went beyond the powers of nature.

Her own peculiarity was especially the remarkable contrast in her brain, that in her paroxysms, in the anterior half of the same, under the influence of Beelzebub---probably owing to an incomplete closure of the skull sutures---one felt the great brain moving convulsively; a movement that immediately stilled itself as the exorcists commanded her demon to depart for the duration of a Miserere; while a similar movement, attaching itself to Leviathan, in like manner, at her command, excited the little brain and stilled it again.

Now Luise, as has been said, a quiet, pious, simple and ignorant girl, who had formerly been Huguenot; thus at least in her youth she had not imbibed the prejudices that are usually attributed to Catholics, had fallen into the magical circle of these possessed ones, and thereby become possessed in a lesser degree than she. Her spirit, which itself, in the manner of demons by arbitrarily assuming names, called itself Verrin, was thus weaker than the demon of Magdalena, Beelzebub; he, the one bound by him, thus subordinate in rank to the binder. But this difference could balance itself out through the difference that the stronger one, by the fault of the possessed, had entered into her; whereas the weaker one had been sent to the innocent other. \[Page 397\]

This one could thus turn to God, that He might arm him with strength for the battle against the overpowering one. In her lucid intervals, the thought may well have come to her more frequently: by this path to win the friend back to God, so that then, as demon armed itself against demon, her own chains might also be broken. But as what occurs in ecstasy returns to memory in the waking state; so too does that which is earnestly and deeply pondered in the waking world reach into the ecstatic state, and what is conceived there fulfills itself within it. Her demon, bound by exorcism, thus rose up against the demon of Magdalena, just as her will stood in opposition to that of the other. That the conduct of this struggle was guided not by her will in its freedom, but rather by the demonic necessity dwelling within her, of this she was well aware; and the state of her conscience, amid all these events, had just given voice through her mouth to the power that compelled her in the demonic ecstasy, as she said: How could you priests administer the Communion to this sevenfold perjurer, were she not possessed? She would truly be worthy to suffer a sevenfold death by fire.

Thus it developed, since her exorcist had entered into it, that the matter proceeded in the manner demonstrated to its end. In the events in Flanders, it was the same case, only reversed in form. That Maria de Sains was in boldness and sinful audacity of thought, of Titanic kind and root; quite worthy to represent the great woman of the Simonians of her time. Through strange dispensation she had fallen into that newly founded convent, and soon drew it into the whirlpools of her immeasurably turbulent nature. At first she had tried holiness; but since this role suited her being poorly, turning to the demonic she devoted herself to it, and soon her fellow sisters had to feel her power. All had fallen into the fetters of her superior demonic spirit; all had succumbed to obsession, only varying gradually according to the personalities; whereby that Simona Dourlet, as it seems, had stood particularly close to her.

The events at St. Baume, the reports of the Prince of the Sabbath and the birth of the Antichrist, occupied all minds at that time; and since she had mastered all fantasies, they also became vocal in the convent where the Sabbath raged. The terrors that threatened in the wake of these imaginings may well not have failed to have their effect even on the otherwise fearless one; the involuntary, suddenly rising impulses that are frequent in this state did their part; and she had confessed herself as the originator of the evils that oppressed the convent; without, in one-and-a-half years of imprisonment, allowing any further confession to be extorted or dissuaded from her otherwise.

Only after the passage of this time had the same spark that had been kindled in the Louise also excited the energumens, especially the Imberta Perona; and when the demon betrayed signs from her that the demonic state had produced in her; then her defiance was broken, the exorcism over her had taken effect, and she had made all confessions, and now helped herself again to induce others to the same. The Simona Dourlet offered herself to her at the right moment, and a struggle began between the two women as to which was the stronger, and which could master and bind the other. One was well practiced in defense, but the other in attack yet more energetic and quick in strength. \[Page 398\]

Thus the alternating struggle lasted long; finally the attacker drew the other into her magical circle; she awakened her sleeping conscience, stirred her slumbering memory, and effected through the superiority of the rapports emanating from her: that what she had hitherto persuaded herself to regard as dreams and illusions possessed reality; so that she, who had earlier denied everything, now bound to the train of ideas of the victor, confirmed everything that the latter had previously communicated about it; however, as always in such cases, with relapses into the old belief.

The first ground of this entire chain of strange occurrences lay in the opinion of the exorcist Dompt: that it was feasible to set the devil in the possessed upon the lampstand, and to make him a witness of the truth in court and everywhere. He knew very well that the Lord had said of him: he was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him; when he speaks a lie, then he speaks from his own, because he is a liar and the father of lies. But he judged: if therefore there is no truth in him, then it must be placed into him. But that can only happen through the almighty God, and through the mediation of the Church, which has the power to command the demons. Thus the Church adjures the demon in his name, through the mouth of the possessed, to speak the truth; and he himself confirms the stated truth with an oath valid in all forms, and the intended purpose is achieved.

He forgot, however, first of all: that the Lord Himself, who was at that time still at once the Church, did not accept the testimony of the possessed ones of Gerasa, who greeted Him as the Son of the most high God; that He by no means sent them forth, as His prophets from the denying side, into all the world to spread abroad this their testimony; but that He banned this whole cloud in the demonic legion into the herd, where then the waves of the sea swallowed up their testimony. When the Godhead, fully well informed about their circumstances, placed all created spirits in the position to prove their freedom, it granted them free choice between their Creator and themselves. Of them, one part chose Him, and these thereby won for their will the full freedom of the Good.

Another part chose itself, and as their sin set itself separating between them and God, and they, losing their freedom, fell into the bondage of Evil, of which they had been the originators, and Satan was rejected. Satan is therefore a murderer from the beginning, and indeed he began with suicide, in that he cast himself out of the life of freedom into that eternal death which is precisely rejection. For since he was not able to annihilate the being created for him, all the power implanted in this being remained to him also, and he turned it denyingly against his Originator; but since the denial of the God-willed is the ground of the lie, the lie must also recognize him as its father; and he lies by virtue of his essence, driven to it by an inner necessity. \[Page 399\]

God respects this necessity, which attaches itself to his will corrupted in the root, and guides his arbitrariness; as the Godhead did not compel him to the first choice, so it does not compel him either in the consequences that have arisen from the choice made; only in his power does he find himself limited, and he must, against his will, cooperate in the execution of the will of Providence. It does not compel him, therefore, to speak the truth against his nature; and if upon that limitation the power of exorcism rests, then no such one will be able to compel the lie to speak the truth. No oath will be able to prove the spoken word as such either; for as the speaker has only expressed herself in the words, so she also swears only by herself, and by her personality, which has no faith. One might say: that, since the oath happens through the mouth of the possessed creature, God could not allow that this one be compelled to a false oath. But she has not in truth sworn falsely; for as the spirit spoke out of her, so has he also given the oath out of her; she herself, however, has the complete conviction of the necessity that has seized her, and bound her as an instrument. The exorcist who thus builds further upon the ground of such an exorcism and oath has himself mounted the hobby-horse of dominion, and will be carried away by it over heights and abysses. The ecstatic one finds herself demonized in her paroxysm, in all her drives and inclinations; and to the speeches that she takes from the store of the possessing spirit, she may well add others from her own, without being fully mistress of herself therein. One already knows how close, in the somnambulistic states, especially those of the dark kind, the lie stands to the truth. We have earlier explained how manifoldly errors even arise among the higher ecclesiastical ecstatics, who were held in the strict discipline of their confessors, and how wild waters from near-lying, false sources stream even to the clarified will, and how, especially in the lower degrees, the incautious guide can become a plaything of wild fantasies, especially among women. This possibility of deception increases, among the demonically ecstatic ones, to the infinite.

They stand to their exorcists in the same relation as those to their leaders; the one side is placed under the power of obedience, the other side is in servitude obedient to their commanders. Both are clairvoyant, and read the commander's thoughts already in their workshop; but whereas there error and mistake condition the evasion, here it is the lie that formally rebels in a slavish manner. Thus in the present case the exorcists, with the fable-work about the Antichrist, have been formally deceived. As, as the founder of the church, a concrete divine-human personality, in the Incarnation, stands at the beginning of history: so at the end of it a similarly concrete, demonically human one, with a kind of false Incarnation, the aping of the Antichrist, who there seeks to destroy the work of the First.

As now Christ, in the church, as in his body spreading himself out, passes through all history, and at the end appears again victoriously in concrete personality; so too the Antichrist has already been at the beginning, is in everything that happens throughout the whole history as Antichristian, in doctrine and statute and outward expression of life, born anew again and again; tempts and seduces, fights and resists, flourishes and succumbs, until he at the end of the days gathers himself together into concreteness for the last decisive battle. \[Page 400\]

This historical Antichrist of their time the women have seen in their ecstasy; that was the truth in their visions. But whereas they have performed the opposite of the work of our pantheists---who seek to dissipate the concrete Christ into the generally historical---, and on their side have brought the general Antichrist into a personal concreteness; and have now attached this one to themselves, to their Sabbaths, and their mystical births from the Incubus, just as those philosophers to their schools and coteries, they have spun out lies for that fable-work which sets us in wonder at their statements. Let us look at it more closely, then we find how it has proceeded from the study of the Apocalypse, supplemented by the Gospels.

The former had given the fundamental type of the figure of the Antichrist, and since he was now to be in everything the counterpart of Christ; so the others had to enclose the form within themselves, in order to grasp him and his surroundings in definite features. That was now, in its plastic execution, the work of the ecstatics; but what lies at the basis of this, the plan and outline, came to them from elsewhere. It was probably the Dominican who, already initiated into the whole circle of ideas of St. Baume, had made those apocalyptic and evangelical studies. He now stood in the midst of all these possessed ones; the exorcism had placed him in the closest spiritual intercourse with them; so that they around him mirrored his whole circle of ideas; not merely themselves unmoved, and only reflecting how they had taken it in, but livingly fructified by him, and in the rest incorporated, bearing it forth again.

What thus in him existed merely subjectively as a power of thought, that objectified itself in them; it was as it were clothed with flesh and bone, and now tangibly born out to him by the women. All this happened without conscious intervention on his side and on their side, in a night-shrouded region, unconscious to the waking world. Of coarse deception there could be no question, a truth lay also in the whole; but the deception was hard to detect and separate, because in the pre-established harmony of both circles every thought found its confirmation in every fact, and in the unconsciousness of the whole state every external means of examination failed in its service.

It was just as it was with the scientific systems of our days; the method of progress, mathematical or logical, is impeccable, the thoughts are linked together in the best possible way; every step forward is most perfectly justified by the preceding ones, and yet all the results are false, because the assumptions had been false; and one had now, in a perfectly school-like manner, calculated out a false final result. Just as the Jews, deceiving themselves in many ways and often accustomed to believe that their Messiah-idea had become concrete in this or that individual; so had one built up the whole labyrinth on the false assumption that the Anti-Messiah-idea must now reach concretion. The error was thus also the whole fruit that one had gained; the proclaimed Antichrist failed to appear, although he raged through the history of the entire era; and it showed itself once more that one had completely misunderstood the whole symbolism of these conditions, interpreting them in a grossly human manner. Fortunately, as far as one can see, none of those involved had to atone for the hermeneutic error with their lives. \[Page 401\]

More closely or more distantly connected with these events was everything that occurred around that time relating to such matters; even 25 years later, in the history of Louviers, the spirits knew to speak of it. When Mathurin Picard there, in the year 1642, had died a shameful death, he had, after appointing a successor of the same stamp, had himself buried in the church at the grating of the nuns' choir. Now nearly all the nuns of the community became possessed; so that they, from that point onward and into the fourth year, fell into a state of rage and demonic madness that completely robbed them of their freedom and the use of reason. Scarcely had the body been laid in its place when all of them, without exception, fell into rage, burst into terrible screams, and under frightful contortions railed against the deceased in the most shameful and filthy words, and against religion and the sacraments in every sort of blasphemy.

The supplemental confessor of the convent had already earlier, 613 still during Picard's lifetime, made a report to François Bertier, Bishop of Evreux, a well-meaning and pious man; and this one had personally betaken himself to the convent, heard the nuns' general confession two to four times, and therein learned a part of the truth. Reasonable provisions that he had taken for their protection had been the consequence of this visit; but Picard had known how to turn the repentant ones away again, and they had made a new donation to him. Now, after the death, a report was made once more, and he came a second time to gain insight into the matter. He found everything in the greatest uproar, the whole convent filled with screams, horror, and despair. He had exorcism applied, and all screamed that they saw Picard's cadaver in the chapel, borne by four demons, and now bore witness to his sorcery, to his appearance at the Sabbath; his body was the true bewitchment of the convent, and no healing was to be thought of until it had been removed. Other inquiries and the testimony of la Bavent seemed to confirm the same. One therefore resolved on the removal of the corpse from the church; it was, after prior excommunication, dug up at night, and, to conceal the matter for the sake of the order's honor, carried to the cave of Crosnier and there thrown into a tower-deep abyss. Meanwhile the spirits of the possessed screamed: how clever one thinks oneself, yet the matter would still come to the light of day; for God's decree lets itself not be determined by the blindness of men.

Two months the matter remained hidden; now a dark rumor circulated that something was amiss in the cave of Crosniersen, children had noticed something unusual in the abyss; finally they had descended, and had found and recognized Picard. The relatives of the man had now taken the matter in hand, and the courts had involved themselves in it. The spirits had declared themselves just as unanimously against Bavent as they had against Picard: she had first brought the devil into the house; if the malefactress were driven out, then first could healing come to the house. All said the most horrible things about her; 56 points, many of which she, however, staunchly denies in her memoirs, and also revokes several of her own earlier statements. The end was that the bishop, after she had previously been examined for stigmatization, ordered her to be unveiled; she was to spend her lifetime in prison, and to fast three times in every week on water and bread. The judgment was carried out, and she was locked in an underground prison. \[Page 402\]

She does not complain against the injustice of the judgment, although it was passed without really hearing her; but she does complain against the harshness, that in prison every other confessor than the bishop's penitentiary was denied her; against whom she had an invincible aversion. A dark despair therefore soon took hold of her, in her five years' long solitude. With a rusty knife that she had found there, she gave herself stabs in the arm, to hit the veins; then sought to cut her throat, and finally thrust it into her belly up to the handle, keeping it in the wound for four hours, and turning it from time to time. All else aside, she suffered from the wounds like from a cancerous ulcer that had attached itself to her breast. Three days later she ground glass, and took it spoonful by spoonful, abstaining from every other nourishment; she vomited much blood, fell often into fainting fits, but likewise survived the desperate attempt.

Five times in succession she persisted in this her desperation, each time seven days long, without taking any nourishment into herself; she was thereby examined four times with great pains by doctors and surgeons; she had fits of the most violent rage against the Lord, on account of her sufferings; called upon the demons for revenge, but had thereby, in her very greatest anger, the comforting appearance of an angel; then fell back again into her despair, ate spiders, and held back her menstruation; was already about to take arsenic, which she had managed to procure for herself, when another appearance hindered her; and in between had to struggle with the importunities of the crude folk who guarded her. Thus did her earlier godlessness avenge itself upon her.

The relatives of the exhumed Picard had meanwhile become complainants before the government; the council of state had referred the investigation of the whole matter to the Parliament of Rouen. This had inquired into the life and conduct of the nuns, heard the witnesses, and recognized the guilt of some and the innocence of the others. At the end of August 1646 the judgment was passed, whereby Picard, Boulé and Bavent, convicted of sorcery, sacrilege, and other abominable crimes, were declared guilty of death. Picard was to be dragged on a hurdle and burned, Boulé hanged and burned; Bavent was to be kept in custody until the decision of the investigation pending against Louise, a co-defendant. The first judgments were carried out, and the records now thrown into the flames along with them; but no further judgment on Bavent is to be found. The exorcisms had likewise been continued until the beginning of 1646, and had finally achieved the liberation. The bishop died from the exertion and vexation.

Almost simultaneously with this story in Normandy, another highly remarkable event occurred in Loudun, a small town that separates the provinces of Touraine, Poitou, and Anjou from one another without ever having belonged to any of them. There, Urbain Grandier was the first pastor of the town at St. Peter's, and moreover capitular at the foundation of the Holy Cross. He was one of those characters who, wherever they may be found, appear destined by nature to rule; for he combined great talent with an equal energy of will, and a rich vein of life dwelt in him within a tall stature. He was an outstanding preacher, knew how to express himself with grace and ease in social intercourse; a firm and penetrating spirit made itself known in all his utterances; thus he soon became a phenomenon in the little town. But he lacked the religious and ethical foundation upon which these gifts could develop. \[Page 403\]

A great inclination toward lust had been given to him as an additional trait, and he soon allowed himself to be mastered by it. Sixty unimpeachable witnesses testified in his later trial to all the adulteries, incests, sacrileges, and other godless acts that he committed in his church, in the vicinity of the Sacrament, without distinction of time of day, at every hour and in every moment. In order to gloss over this licentiousness before his conscience, he wrote a treatise against celibacy, which was found among his papers along with various obscene poems under investigation. The old men whose daughters, and the men whose wives he dishonored, became furious against him; and he now turned the entire cutting sharpness of his character against them, instead of doing anything conciliatory.

The complaint of the injured parties was lodged with his bishop in Poitiers; he was arrested in connection with it, and by the judgment of the officialate on the third of January 1630 was interdicted for five years in the diocese, and forever in Loudun. He appealed to the archbishop of Bordeaux, who acquitted him; however, with the advice to exchange his benefices. But he instead made his entry into Loudun with a laurel branch in his hands; he pressed his hard-won right to the utmost point, held the cold point of mockery toward his enemies everywhere, and involved them one after another in quarrels and lawsuits of every kind. Thus he became the tyrant of the place, an object of fear and terror to the weak and of irreconcilable hatred to the strong.

While the Catholics were thus averse to him in this way, and many did not attend his church, the Huguenots had taken his side. Loudun had been their stronghold in the earlier wars, and many of the Calvinists who lived there at the time judged not without reason that Grandier belonged in his innermost conviction to their sect, and that only the inevitable threatening loss of his benefices had held him back from openly joining them.

They therefore took his side without hesitation; it is true that in times when their confession lay wholly prostrate and Richelieu ruled with absolute power, these were dangerous allies. Thus stood things around him in the ordinary course of the world; but they had yet another side. Every person has a spiritual sphere of influence about himself, which, however, only extends in the inner circles, but in ordinary life, incorporated into the outer sphere of existence and enveloped by it, makes itself felt only through it and within it.

But if that interpenetration is partially suspended; if, without their being wholly separated from one another, a division nonetheless arises, and an overstepping of the inner over the outer occurs, whether in giving or receiving; then the intensive effects also disentangle themselves from the extensive ones, and spiritual rapports develop from the earlier physical sympathies and antipathies. Grandier, relying on his personal superiority, secured against the aversion of his fellow believers by the affections of their opponents, outwardly, as it seemed, unassailable, should yet not escape the fate of all pride, and Nemesis lay in wait for him on these night-shrouded paths. A convent of the then still new order of Ursulines had been established in Loudun since 1626. \[Page 404\]

Fourteen girls, all from good families, noble and non-noble, altogether of blameless life, had come together in one house; and, under the direction of a director, eked out, in their poverty, the continuance of their community through a pension school which they had founded. Things had proceeded in the usual tracks in this nascent convent, when the director died; Grandier, proposed as his successor, was rejected by the superior, and in his place Mignon, one of his adversaries, was chosen by the convent. The convent had been somewhat earlier disturbed by nocturnal apparitions, as the opponents said, or by the caprice of some nuns. Now disquieting signs began to appear, which were at first taken for symptoms of female illness and quietly sought to be dispelled.

The signs multiplied and became ever more unequivocal; the physicians had to be dismissed, and exorcists called in for aid. Dark rumors first flew through the town; soon the whole truth became known: fourteen nuns showed themselves possessed in the convent; the people took their children back, and while want and distress now entered among the nuns, they were regarded by some as those who had forsaken God, by others as fools and hysterical visionaries. The seal with which the nocturnal world is closed had been broken open for them; the first thing they perceived there was the magnet toward which the little town had long been accustomed to turn in hatred and love.

Their negatively demonic state sought about for an object on which it could complete itself; and found it in Grandier, brought into close rapport with them by his scoundrelly nature, pride, and hypocrisy. The relations of the sexes, which by day had friendly or hostile brought the female town into connection with him, had also here, conducting through the night, exerted their influence. For months the nuns saw him every night at their bedside, ceaselessly inciting them to evil; their statements gained credence when it was seen how, despite their bitter poverty, they remained blameless and fulfilled all the duties of their station with zeal and exactitude. In the exorcism the spirits named him unanimously as the one who had bound them in obsession. Into the mass of passions that had accumulated in the town, the igniting spark had now been cast. From the hearts the conflagration spread swiftly to the heads; everyone took sides for or against; Grandier and his closer adherents naturally did not remain idle, and great ferment began to stir in the little town.

When the royal councilor Laubardemont arrived in Loudun to carry out the decree that ordered the demolition of all fortresses in the interior at the castle there, he found the entire city in the most violent agitation, which his mission only further increased. 619\
Upon his return, he made his report on this to King Louis XIII, and the latter instructed him, in late November 1633, to select thirteen of the most honest and skilled judges from the jurisdictions in the surrounding area, and with them to decide the matter without appeal. It happened as the king had commanded, and Grandier was provisionally arrested. In such exceptional courts, politics is to sit in judgment alongside the law. But that is an evil alliance, where one of the allies indeed represents the accused, while the other, speaking in the name of the whole, places the reason of state into the scales. \[Page 405\]

In times when this politics has not yet fully emancipated itself from conscience and morality, it will not demand of the judges that they declare the innocent guilty against their conviction; but it will nonetheless always, in doubtful cases where the verdict wavers, not hesitate to intervene subsidiarly and tip the scales. Grandier's case had become a party matter, and this had precisely provided the occasion to allow that alliance to enter the court as a counterforce. The more his party reacted, the more it had to increase the power of the political element. The conscience of the judges found its reassurance in the fact that, as soon became evident, Grandier's case had from the outset been ethically utterly lost; and the trial, conducted in the ordinary civil forms, had to lead to his ruin.

Thus the investigation into sorcery soon took a ominous turn for him, and it could be foreseen that it must lead to an evil outcome. However much the defeated party reviled the verdict, it did not dare to cast suspicion on the integrity of the thirteen judges; it reproached them only with all too great credulity: a reproach that, in a certain sense, but different from how it was meant here, was not entirely unfounded.

The commissioner Laubardemont began by taking the depositions of the witnesses; among them also those who had previously been frightened away from their testimony. The possessed were separated in houses, and then interrogated in their calm periods; the speeches that they delivered during their paroxysms, which the exorcism, performed each time by the Bishop of Poitiers, brought about, were to count only as indications for the further investigation. Their entire lives were subjected to the sharpest scrutiny; never did the statements of 20 individuals conflict on a point.

Three and a half months of continued exorcism had demonstrated with evidence that they were truly in a state of obsession, for they had shown all the signs that the Church requires to determine the judgment on it. With regard to the understanding of languages, M. de Launoy de Razilly, who had long resided in America, gave testimony that he had spoken with the possessed in the language of some native tribes of that country; that they had answered him quite appropriately, and had also revealed to him several things that had occurred there. Some noblemen from Normandy testified that they had put questions to Sister Claire of Sazilly in Turkish, Spanish, and Italian, and that she had answered them satisfactorily. M. de Nismes, Doctor of the Sorbonne, one of the almoners of the Cardinal of Lyon, had posed his questions in German and Greek; Father Vignier, Superior of the Oratorians, likewise, for an entire afternoon, in the latter language: both had been completely satisfied. \[Page 406\]

The Bishop of Nîmes had commanded Sister Clara in Greek: to lift her veil and kiss the grating; she had obeyed, and done much else besides, so that he said: one must be a fool or an atheist to not believe in her possession. The doctors likewise questioned her about Greek expressions of their science known only to the initiated, and received clear answers. In the same way, the possessed obeyed commands that were given to them only inwardly. The Prior of Maillezais conducted such a test; he whispered in the ear of Canon Fernaison how he wished the possessed one, in the missal that lay at the grating, to place her finger on the beginning of the Mass of the Blessed Virgin, and the words: Salva, sancta parens lege. The exorcist, Mr. von Morans, who had heard nothing of these words, now commanded her to follow the intention of the Prior. She fell into strong convulsions, spoke blasphemies, named the Prior, whom she did not know, by name, and after repeated commands, took hold of the missal, saying: I will pray, and now averting her eyes, placed her finger on the large S at the entrance of this Mass.

A verbal record was taken of this event. As Mr. von Millières knelt praying during the exorcism of Sister Clara, she asked him: whether he was praying a De Profundis for his wife? which was indeed the case. Sister Louise of Nogaret testified to the Marquis de la Mothe: that she had revealed to him the state of his conscience. Father Surin, whose truthfulness even the most vehement opponents never dared to question, testifies: how Johanna, the superior, revealed to him many hundreds of times the most secret things, and how a priest of his order directed an inner command to the demon, then revoked it inwardly with a second, and so on up to the seventh, and then he called out: Obediat ad mentem. The possessed repeated the first command and then said: but the Lord does not wish it, and so she continued with all six one after another; whereupon at the seventh she finally said: so let us then carry this out, wherein he had remained standing! In the same way, they came to the commands of the exorcists from distant places.

They astonished these by the quick answers they gave to the most difficult theological questions on grace, the vision of God, the angels, and the Incarnation, and indeed in the expressions of the School. They looked into the distance as they looked into the inner depths of souls: and while the superior Johanna, according to his testimony, revealed to Father Surin the secrets also of those whose guidance he had undertaken at his earlier residence in Marennes in Saintonge; the parliamentary councillor of Brittany, Kerioles, likewise made an experience of this gift that was decisive for his life. This man was sunk in all vices, without any religion or any faith; a raging atheist and of such rabid defiance that, when a thunderstorm rose in the sky, he directed the muzzle of his pistols against it, and once when the lightning struck his room, he, surrounded by fire and flames, while all his people cried for mercy, alone poured himself out in mockery and scorn. \[Page 407\]

All his thinking was forever directed only toward doing evil, and even more evil than all others; and he had once resolved to become a Mohammedan among the Turks, only so that he might have the opportunity to inflict all conceivable harm on the Christians. As all his thinking and striving were directed only toward atrocities and vices, so he also came to Loudun for such a goal and end; in short, one might well, in Surin's words, scarcely have seen a more despairing and vice-ridden man than this one. Immediately upon his arrival, he poured out his mockery over the nuns, and declared them all and sundry to be foolish. But God knows how to lead things to His end, and saved this bondsman of Satan through him himself.

Right at the first exorcism, where he was present, the possessed revealed to him his most secret affairs, which no one could know except himself; so that he was most profoundly shaken. He returned a second time, and was now so moved and turned within himself that he performed terrible penance, and from then on led a holy life. The spirits confessed that it was the holy Virgin who had snatched him from their hands. He sold his position, later became a priest, and converted his house into a hospital. More than fifty doctors, one after another, declared in authentic verbal processes that what the possessed performed physically surpassed all the powers of nature.

At the command of the exorcists they went immediately, without their pulse changing in the slightest, into the most violent convulsions; the face became frightful to behold; the tongue protruded black, thick, hard, and covered with pustules from the mouth, without this hindering them in the least from speaking clearly. They supported themselves solely on their stomachs, placed the palms of their hands on the soles of their feet with their arms twisted or threw their heads back to their heels, and in this way ran quickly and much about. They remained awake continuously, and fasted sometimes uninterruptedly for 5--6 days; without this being detrimental to their health, but rather seeming only to strengthen that of the weaker ones.

They often fell suddenly asleep; in the case of Francisca Filastreau one then heard, with her mouth tightly closed, many voices quarreling about which of them should speak. One saw several times the Elisabeth Blanchard, in her convulsions, holding herself with her feet upward and her head downward on a chair or window without support. The superior Johanna, according to a verbal process, once hovered two feet above the ground. Lying full length, they were lifted up like statues without the slightest movement on their part. Many became flexible like a lead strip, so that one could bend them into any form, which they then retained. Others stretched their legs so far apart to left and right that their perineum touched the ground: the body held straight upright, the hands folded. In the case of the superior, the distance of one foot from the other in this position was seven feet, although she was only four feet tall.

On May 9, 1635, Monsieur, the brother of the king, came to Loudun to witness the events that were causing such a sensation throughout all of France. On the following day he went to the church of St. Ursula, where Elisabeth Blanchard was to receive communion. She was possessed by six spirits, one of which, called Ashtaroth, soon stirred, and now, conjured by the exorcist, soon made her fall into convulsions: so that she, twitching and rolling about, crawled to the feet of the priest, who placed the holy Sacrament on her lips, at the same time commanding the demon: to undertake nothing irreverent against it, or even to moisten the host in any way. \[Page 408\]

The possessed woman was immediately thrown to the ground, bent backward three times so that she touched the ground with her feet and the tip of her nose; whereby it appeared as if she wanted to rub the host on the earth, as she came so close to it that only the thickness of the paper separated them.

When the exorcist hindered the execution through his repeated prohibition, the demon raised the girl again and blew upon the host that was visible on his lips; it moved like a tree leaf in the breeze, oscillating between the lips. When the exorcist now adjured Beelzebub to ascend into her face, the throat swelled extraordinarily, became hard, and one felt a throbbing in it. Thus one of her spirits after the other was adjured to make itself visible, and each obeyed, distorting the face in a manner peculiar to it into something gruesome; whereby Astaroth, under the left armpit, produced a large swelling with violent throbbing, to the astonishment of the prince's body physician.

He then ascended, driven from there by the exorcist, into her face, and caused the host to fall onto the paten; where it was found, upon close examination by the exorcist's finger, entirely dry. The lips of the possessed were also in truth so parched that they peeled off, and the skin appeared entirely white. The exorcist now wiped her teeth with a cloth and brought the host to one of the upper row, where it, touching the jaw with only a part of its circumference, again hung there for a long time; despite the most violent shakings of the entire body, the strangest contortions of the mouth, and a violent blowing that the spirit produced. She was now commanded to swallow the forms, which happened immediately.

The exorcist now asked the body physician himself to examine the girl's mouth, to see whether the host was still present. He did so, by running his fingers along the gum to the throat, and thus convinced himself that nothing was present in the mouth. The girl was now allowed to drink water, and her mouth was examined again afterward. Upon the command that the exorcist now directed at Astaroth---to bring back the host---one saw it immediately thereafter on the tip of the tongue. The same test was repeated twice more. The prince was likewise an eyewitness to most of the above-mentioned phenomena, and had a detailed, authentic testimony drawn up about them, beginning with the words: Nous Gaston fils de France Duc d'Orléans, certifions etc., under the 11th of May 1635.

The judges, under these circumstances, could not deny their belief in the truth of the obsession; they also prepared themselves churchly for their judicial office with earnestness, and examined the process for 40 days; Grandier was confronted with the witnesses, and these stood by their statements. He, for his part, denied everything, all the accusations made were lies or imaginings, and he had never engaged in magic. In doing so, he displayed the firmness of his character, and conducted himself throughout the course of the affair with cool blood and great composure and presence of mind. Since he denied the truth of the nuns' possession, he was called upon to conduct the exorcism himself. \[Page 409\]

The Bishop of Poitiers gave him permission and authority; he put on the stole, the possessed were brought into the choir of the church, and now a terrible scene began. He started the exorcism with Sister Catherine, the most ignorant of all, whom he adjured in Latin. But all the others were now seized at once, and began to howl and scream. Sister Clara was the loudest of all, and went at him; he therefore desisted from the former, and turned to her, who, however, without paying attention to him, spoke confused nonsense. The superior stepped in between, he now addressed her again, but had previously said: since she understood Latin, he would speak Greek to her. The response he received then was: Thou art cunning, for thou knowest full well that it is the first condition of the pact not to speak Greek; he had rightly replied: O pulchra illusio, egregia evasio!

Now he was told: he should exorcise in Greek, but first write down what he intended to say. But the possessed ones fell anew into rage, raged and howled, suffered convulsions, accused him of sorcery, and offered to break his neck if it were permitted; but this, as was natural, the exorcists prevented. He himself remained calm and composed amid all the clamor, looked the possessed ones firmly in the eye, spoke of his innocence, and boldly requested only this: that they allow the demons to break his neck, or merely to make a mark on his forehead if he were truly guilty; yet none of the possessed might touch him in the process.

The exorcists brought the raging ones back to calm, and now a chafing dish was brought in to burn four documents of Grandier's that the possessed had submitted. This was done, but now the previous scene repeated itself with double the intensity; the confusion became indescribable, the screaming so piercing, the bearing so frightful, that the assembly---honoring the sanctity of the place---could pass for a true Sabbath. Grandier alone remained unshaken and expressed no astonishment, even though the raving ones threw all his sins in his face, which he in turn denied, renouncing Satan and declaring: that he was, in defiance of him, still a Christian, and more than that, a priest; at times he even joined with the assembled people in singing hymns. This continued, the fury against him increasing from time to time, and he would have been torn apart had the bystanders not prevented it and led him out of the church. On that day they had all the trouble in the world to calm the nuns again.

One must not be astonished at this rabid uproar and this tumult of the powers of hell in human nature. Grandier, a man vigorous in outward life but morally decayed toward death within, unworthy as he might always have been as a priest: now confronted the demonic forces, armed with all the power and authority of the Church, in order to exorcise them. The nuns, as such belonging likewise more closely to the Church, of blameless conduct in their free moments, quiet and good-natured by nature, who carried within themselves the full subjective sense of the man's entanglement---sober though it was---in the demonic, now heard the words of exorcism from his mouth. \[Page 410\]

It had to turn out as when a drop of water falls into red-hot molten copper; their own demonic element had to rise up in wrath and explode terribly. But the entire event could lead to the trace of the whole error and make it comprehensible: that here opposing spheres, which could never understand one another, had come into conflict; and that therefore none could give testimony against the other. Grandier was well aware of his crimes and the untenability of his inner foundation; since every sin entwines itself with the demon, he---as a priest though he was---must know himself to be entangled and confused with him as well. But his sins were of a prosaic nature, committed in clear deliberation, and thus the bond was of like kind; but of actual sorcery he knew himself to be free, and he did not consider it possible that such a thing could be proven against him. Hence his cool-headedness and composure, which now had to explain the nuns' accusations as a work of lies and the malice of his enemies.

The possessed, for their part, were free from all deliberate deceit; they beheld what they uttered with full, subjective conviction of its truth; for the inner side of the man was turned toward their own inner being, and they merely bore witness to what they found inscribed there. But the language in which it was inscribed was a symbolic one, which they, in reading it, had only to translate into the ordinary tongue. The entanglements into which he had fallen with the demon on his path, however, led directly, on their paths, back into their own inner selves; for the same demon had also seized and ensnared them, albeit in a mystical manner; and the same phallic symbols, which appeared frequently in that process and expressed the connection in their intuitions, returned also for the other relations, and they interpreted them in their mystical language. And just as he, on his side, found their accusations---taking them according to the letter---unfounded, and therefore declared them to spring from infamous malice; so the others, in turn, misunderstood this denial of his, and they marveled and were outraged at the shamelessness that dared to deny what lay so clearly and openly before their eyes, even to the point of tangibility.

Thus the matter became ever more deeply confused with every step forward, until it reached utter inextricability; and it could not be expected of the judges that they, alone, should peer beyond the spiritual horizon of the time into the inner recesses of these entanglements. They had the choice: either to declare an entire convent, along with all who had taken part in the affair, as accomplices in a grievous, devilish deception; or to find guilty the one whose evil character they knew full well. If the nuns had recognized him---whom, according to their assurances, they had never seen---at the very first confrontation; then they could not know that this might, at most, be explained by natural clairvoyance.

They had no experiences yet to show that the convulsions which seized the obsessed upon the mere mention of his name gave no conclusive testimony to his objective guilt. If one of the spirits of the superior Johanna had indicated the spots on his body marked by five signs; and now eight physicians, sent to search for them on him, believed they had truly found only two---one on the shoulder, the other on the scrotum---because the needle, driven in there thumb-thick, had produced only a dull pain, and no blood had followed---; then they could not know that even these signs, if they were indubitably present, led into error. \[Page 411\]

The coincidence of a scar on his thumb with a few drops of blood on an attached prescription gave free play to every interpretation. The judges, assembled for the last time, pronounced all unanimously: "We convict, and declare the said Urbain Grandier guilty and convicted of the crime of magic, witchcraft, and possession caused by his actions, in the persons of certain Ursuline nuns of this town of Loudun and other secular individuals; together with the other cases and crimes resulting from this."

Although no court of today, even a thoroughly Catholic one, would render such a judgment in this case; yet one may fully credit the reporter when, in the *Relation veritable* p. 43, he says: they had felt a complete satisfaction in their consciences at their verdict. Before his execution, he was to be put to the torture in the usual manner, in order to discover his accomplices. But he utterly denied having any such; even in the midst of harsh torment he said only that he was no sorcerer, but otherwise he had in truth committed greater crimes than this. When asked: what crimes? he replied: such as arise from human frailty; adding: it would have cost him more to confess these than that of which he was accused.

When they prepared to lead him to his death, he refused every consolation, and pushed away the crucifix that was offered to him. Thus he mounted the pyre; it had been granted to him that he should first be strangled before the flames consumed him; but these seized the rope before the executioner could carry out the deed. So he fell into the flames, which mercilessly devoured the unfortunate man; he who had not the comfort of a clear conscience, and who spurned the consolations of religion because he believed himself abandoned by it.

As he had fallen into the conflict between unbridled sensuality and the duties of his station; so in its train had he fallen into the other, between the inner and outer world, which then entangled him in the third, the external one between Catholics and Huguenots; and now he was torn asunder, as the opposing whirlpools that had seized him pulled him apart. His contemporaries found the judgment of the judges not unjust; only fifty years later, after judges and witnesses had long since died, did Aubin, an exiled Huguenot, write his book. Grandier had here fallen as a victim of the powerful Richelieu, against whom he was said to have written a satire; Laubardemont was the instrument of the minister, Mignon and Barré were the infamous mountebanks who had trained the nuns in their arts; the Bishop of Poitiers and all others who had otherwise taken part in the affair were in agreement; all the rest, Monsieur and the court at their head, weak, credulous fools; all this set forth with bold courage, without further warrant of the facts, and argued through with great intellectual sharpness in a rationalizing manner.

It was the protestation of the ruling exclusive understanding, directed against the equally exclusive inner vision; the rational times that now followed allowed no other word to arise in this matter, and for them it rested in the manner in which this their spokesman had presented it¹⁾. With the death of Grandier, moreover, the matter of the possessions in the convent was by no means settled; they continued for a long time after this catastrophe in all their violence. The act had been of too tragic a nature for the surroundings who had taken part in it to entirely escape participation in this character. \[Page 412\]

Therefore an uncanny spirit went among them, striking to the right and to the left at whatever it encountered. The civil lieutenant Louis Chauvet had taken Grandier's side in the trial, especially in the beginning of the exorcisms, and one of the possessed had later accused him too of sorcery. Terror had now become his demon, and he fell into a state in which he was never again seen fully in his senses thereafter. The surgeon Mannoury, who had examined the accused for stigmatization with the probe, was once going home at night after his death, and suddenly recoiled: Ah, Grandier! what do you want from me? The apparition did not leave him until his own death, which occurred a few days later. Father Lactance, one of the exorcists, felt, while he was occupied with the exorcism, brought upon himself manifold reactions; he soon lost his sight, his memory, then again his senses; he suffered now from heartache, then again from temptations in the spirit; he likewise fell ill a few days after Grandier's death, and died after having endured great demonic assaults.

Five years later, P. Tranquillus, a man of saintly demeanor, died of the same affliction. Everything that had previously transpired over two years in Loudun around him repeated itself in him; without it being able to shake him inwardly, and it did not cease from him even later. When he was supposed to preach at vespers, the tumult became so severe that he did not dare to step forward; his confessor now adjured the demon to release him; immediately he ascended the pulpit and preached for the last time in a way that carried all his listeners away; only with the last unction did the demon depart from him, and seized a brother who was present. All the terrors of hell that had been unleashed in that conflict, while all human passions raged around them, must of themselves have exercised a destructive effect upon sensitive souls; but party spirit, forgetting that friends and enemies alike experienced this influence equally, and that it had itself declared the whole affair a play of human depravity, now unhesitatingly believed in the full truth, in order to recognize therein the work of retributive Nemesis.

In any case, the idea of such retribution has no application to Father Surin, who did not come to Loudun until four months after Grandier's death. Soon he too found himself there in that interchange with the spirits of Jeanne previously described; so that once, in the presence of the Bishop of Nîmes, one of them, during the exorcism, threatened him vehemently from the face of the possessed; then suddenly vanished from there, but instead manifested itself in him through pressure on the breast and loss of speech. Driven out from there by ecclesiastical means, it appeared anew on the face of the superior in all its hideousness, while the father on his side again found himself entirely free. \[Page 413\]

This repeated itself on one morning perhaps up to the eighth time; he was struck as if by an arrow, suddenly thrown to the ground, so that he cried out, and they had to touch him with the sacrament at the places where he felt the demon, in order to free him again. Concerning his inner state during this, the sufferer expressed himself in a very remarkable manner in a letter to his fellow order brother P. Dumesnil in Rennes, dated May 3, 1635. There he says among other things: I cannot explain to you what takes place in me during this time, and how this spirit unites itself with mine, without taking from my soul either its consciousness or its freedom; while it yet behaves like my other self, as if I had two souls, one of which is deprived of the use of its organs, and now, holding itself at a distance, looks on at the doings of the other.

The two spirits contend with each other on the same battlefield, the body, and the soul is as if divided, open in the one to hellish impressions, in the other surrendered to its own movements, or to such as come from God. In the same moment I feel a great peace under God's good pleasure, and at the same time I cannot comprehend the raging aversion against him, which calls forth a fury to separate me from him; to the astonishment of all who see it. At the same time great joy and gentleness come over me, and then again a sadness that manifests itself in complaints and in a screaming, as the demons induce it.

I feel and fear the state of damnation, and sense that foreign soul which seems to me to be my own, pierced by despair as if with thorns; while the other, full of good trust, mocks such sensations, and in all freedom curses the one who calls them forth. In truth, I recognize that that cry which issues from my mouth arises equally from these two souls, and I am at a loss to decide whether it is joyfulness that forces it out, or the extraordinary rage that fills me. The trembling that seizes me when the holy Sacrament is brought near to me seems, as I sense, to have its origin just as much in the abhorrence of its proximity, which is unbearable to me, as in a heartfelt and gentle reverence, without my being able to decide or command that it is more the one or the other.

If I wish, at the urging of the one, to mark my mouth with the cross, the other pulls my arm back with great hatred, and makes me seize the finger with my teeth and bite it in rage. In such storms I always find prayer the easiest; while the body writhes on the ground, and the servants of the church speak to me as to a devil, and pronounce curses against me. I cannot describe to you the joy I feel in being a devil in such a manner; not through rebellion against God, but through the calamity which sincerely shows me the state into which sin has placed me: and as I apply the pronounced imprecations to myself, my soul can immerse itself in its own nothingness. \[Page 414\]

When the other possessed see me in this state, it is a joy to observe how they rejoice, and how the demons make merry over me, saying: Physician, heal thyself now! Mount the pulpit, it would be fine to hear you preach after you have thus wallowed on the ground. --- My state is such that few entirely free actions remain to me. If I wish to speak, my tongue fails me; in the Mass I must suddenly stop; at the table I cannot bring the bite to my mouth; in confession all sins suddenly escape me, and I feel that the devil goes in and out of me as in his own house. When I wake, he is there; when I pray, he stirs my thoughts at will; when the heart begins to open itself to God, he fills it with rage; he lulls me to sleep when I would stay awake, and through the mouths of my possessed he publicly boasts: he is my master, against which I can raise no objection.

Thus two demons deal with me, one is Leviathan, the adversary of the Holy Spirit, and the operations of this false Paraclete are entirely the opposite of those of the true one; they produce a desolation that cannot be described; he is the chief of the band of all demons who here perform this strangest of all things, and we have here at once paradise and hell together, and the nuns 634 here are in one sense true Ursulas, in another sense worse than the most lost ones in filth, blasphemies, and fits of rage.

This remarkable self-confession of a man who surely never let an untrue word pass his lips appears instructive and worthy of great attention in many respects. First, it teaches us to know this state of inner decomposition of the indivisible I in man, which in its higher conscious half walks before and after in the light of grace: while the lower, more deeply entangled with the body, other side lies in the shadowing of the nocturnal principle, and everywhere desiring the opposite and driving to accomplish it, yet is recognized by the observing higher self as its other I. Secondly, the testimony imprints on the other, concerning the reality of the nuns' affliction, who were in states only still more highly intensified, the final seal of certainty.

What finally happened to him in such a manner; what later for twelve more years did not leave him; what once in a paroxysm led him to jump out the window of his order's house, so that he broke a leg, and only later finally left him, so that he for a long time thereafter led a quiet, pious life; what befell the other two exorcists: all this shows us the dangers that are connected with the practice of exorcism. Aubin sees nothing in it but that the devil, whom they had painted on the wall, at last truly appeared to them.

From France we cross over to England once more, and there Hutchinson says: it is the land where the terrors of the witchcraft trials were felt the least, and ceased the earliest. There is not a true word in this assertion, neither with regard to the earlier times nor the present times of the uprising. On 20 February 1647, Howell wrote to Edward Spencer: "Since the beginning of these unnatural wars, clouds of witnesses attest to the existence of witchcraft; for in the short space of two years, nearly three hundred witches were brought before the courts, and most of them all executed, and that solely in Essex and Suffolk. Scotland now swarms with them more than ever, and seven persons of the better classes are executed daily." \[Page 415\]

The Long Parliament sent out into the land one of its own trackers in the person of Hopkins, who boasted of a special gift for finding them, and in one year alone brought sixty to the gallows. He usually employed the water test. Another method was to seat the poor, old, frail women, bound in their limbs in such a way that the entire weight of their bodies rested on their seat-flesh, in the middle of a room for 24 hours; until they, with the interruption of the blood circulation, could no longer endure it, and confessed what then cost them their lives. Others were kept awake continuously for four to five days and nights, until they fell into a kind of unconscious, half-visionary state, and then told things of which they afterward, in a calm state, could nevermore remember anything.

These tests were, beside their cruelty, no more rational than those devised by the Indians in Bengal. Branches of a certain tree are each inscribed with an equal number of the names of the village women, from twelve years upward, and in the morning planted in water; whichever branch then wilts within four and a half hours gives testimony that it belongs to a witch. Or small portions of rice, wrapped in cloth and similarly labeled, are placed into the heaps of white ants; she whose rice has been consumed has then drawn the lot of witchcraft. Finally, at lamplight, oil is poured drop by drop onto water, while the names are called out one after another; the shadow of a woman on the water then marks her as guilty.

The mischief of that Hopkins lasted so long, until one of the more respected men of the land had him himself subjected to the water test, and since he floated on top, he had to pay with his life. Z. Grey in his edition of Hudibras reports: he had seen a list of 3000 who in such a manner, during the rule of the Long Parliament, lost their lives. Especially Lancashire, in the north of England, was designated as the witches' land, and the impostor Robinson had played his game there. Toward the end of the century, only under the judgeship of Holt, did the fury of the persecution begin to abate. The testimonies against the old Munnings, in her trial of 1694, were very peremptory; but he knew how to persuade the jury that they, for the first time in a long while, pronounced her not guilty. Ten other similar trials, which were conducted before him from 1694--1701, had the same outcome.

In the case of Wenham, 1711 under Powell, the jury again pronounced her guilty; when questioned once more by the presiding judge as to whether their verdict went so far as to find that the defendant had consorted with the devil in the shape of a cat, the answer was: We find her guilty thereof. She was, however, pardoned. In the year 1716 the Hicks and her nine-year-old daughter were still hanged, because they had devoted themselves to the devil and raised a storm. With them ends the long series of the condemned; for in 1736 the penal law against sorcery was repealed, and offenses of that kind were punished with imprisonment and the pillory. \[Page 416\]

One may credit Barrington when, in his observations on the twentieth statute of Henry VI, he gives the total number of those executed in England since that statute---soon before the beginning of the Reformation up to the repeal---as 30,000; the same number that is given for those executed by the Inquisition, roughly in that same period but over the whole extent of its power, thus in the whole Romanic south and across to the New World, including the Spanish Jews and Muhammadans. One sees: clergy, judges, and the common people from whom the jury was drawn---all were in perfect agreement in their judgment; in place of the witch epidemic there had crept into judicial practice another one that infected all powers of judgment; and one does not know which of the two plagues was the more ruinous to the land.

This becomes especially visible in Germany during and after the Thirty Years' War. The ruin of the country in that accursed time was without measure or limit; the entire people had grown savage, been brought to ruin and despair; faith and trust in Providence had died out, while ignorance was universal. Thus one sought help from the powers that seemed to rule over the age; and with the vices and horrors that followed in the wake of the armies there also roamed all manner of evil arts. Thus sorcery was customary throughout the land, while on the other hand bloodshed had become a mere sport, human life dirt cheap; and a virtuosity in every kind of violence had soon developed. All these skills were now soon applied also to the witch trials; and between the state actions and the battles, the courts too delivered up their victims to the pyre, as bloody as the others.

When the war had passed, the princes had for the most part carried away from it an unlimited territorial sovereignty; and that modern relation between them and the people had developed, in that they had detached themselves from it and, clothed in their wholly abstract power, had set themselves high above it. The consequence of this exalted position was the substitution of officials, even into those affairs that had previously been wholly personal; from which there again arose a complete isolation of the princes, a total estrangement from the actual course of these affairs, a complete independence of those who burdened themselves with them within their own sphere, and soon a ruthless despotic sway, pressing down below and servile above, seeking to compensate for the loss of power through formality. Such were the governments to which the outcry over the witchcraft folly was addressed. All the misery of the time, all the people's need, all the country's devastation, men had prepared it for themselves; their base passions, their apostasy from religion and morality and from themselves, they had filled the witches' cauldron with mischief and abomination until it boiled over, and destruction seized the sorcerers themselves. Now all this was to be laid at the door of the unfortunate witch-women; what nature herself, imitating man, had at times brought forth strange and pernicious things, it was all their doing. \[Page 417\]

In the general barbarization and the crude superstition that had taken the place of faith, every accusation was eagerly seized upon; malice, envy, spite, and the lust for slander grasped with delight at the prey; and thus what had begun with a rumor here or there soon grew into a clamor that spread across all the lands; and it finally reached even the princes in the heights of their abstraction. "Thus it is said: This pest, which corrupts land and people, must be rooted out with all severity. The judges and councils are forthwith instructed to proceed against the sorcerous vermin. With this the princes have now done their part, the cancer is now cut out, all harm from Satan's folk is prevented, they have fulfilled their office, and have shown their zeal in protecting God's honor, and in raging against His enemies with fire and rope. They have now unburdened their conscience, and shifted the responsibility onto the shoulders of the officials; from their lofty height they cannot look more closely to see whether humanity, justice, and equity prevail in the proceedings. But the justice officials, for their part, are not inclined to take the responsibility onto their own shoulders; if innocents must sometimes bleed, that does not concern us, that is the prince's affair, he has his conscience, and must know what is incumbent upon him when he presses us; he may look to it, it is for us to obey."

\"The judges are thus to begin now; but they lack all indicia and proofs, and even, in a certain sense, the criminals themselves. Thus they do not know where to make a start, and they hesitate for a while. They are admonished a first, second, and third time. The people cry out: their laxity has good reasons. The same is made known to the princes; but to rail against these is a grave matter in Teutonia; for whatever they do is well done, so believes the servility of the age. Thus they finally yield, after having cut themselves a starting thread; or if they still hold out longer, an extraordinary commissioner is specially dispatched for the matter; perhaps an inexperienced novice, whose clumsy ineptitude, however, counts as zeal for justice, and whom the reward of 4--5 thalers per head, and other incidental benefits, spurs even further to the task. T \[Page 418\]

he word of a possessed person, or a malicious remark against some old woman, is reported to them; thus they begin with her. In the meantime, however, no process can be started on mere hearsay. Thus they spy into her past life, and it would have to go very ill if that were not found tainted with ill repute; for she has perhaps committed all sorts of evils, and it soon becomes clear that from evil to evil she has finally advanced to the very wellspring of all evils. Or her life was blameless, she went often to church and to the sacraments; that is an equally telling indicium as the former; for the witches, as is well known, are wont to hide behind a pretense of piety. Thus it is ordered that the rightfully suspected be arrested. In the process, new signs emerge again that point to her guilt. She shows herself fearful and startled, for instance, because she already knows what cruel torture awaits her: that is a wholly certain token of her criminality; for her conscience accuses her of the crimes. Or she shows herself undaunted, trusting in her innocence: once more an excellent indicium; for it is the way of the witches to display an iron brow, and to profess themselves entirely innocent. To gather further proofs, special sleuths are sent out; mostly godless folk, to whom it can scarcely fail to uncover something that can be interpreted as sorcery; all the easier if they already bear ill will toward the prisoner. Now it is said: strong indicia lie before us.\"

She is therefore taken into interrogation; no defender is permitted to her, for it is said: her crime is an exceptional case; and it is not easy to find such persons who might be willing to undertake the defense, because suspicion immediately attaches itself to them; just as all those who wish to speak in the matter, and admonish the judge to caution, are very readily branded as patrons of witches. She is therefore brought forward, and the indications of guilt are read to her. If she now completely clears herself of them, and justifies herself against all of them, that avails her nothing at all; the accusations remain in full force; she is merely led back to the dungeon, to reflect there more closely: whether she wishes to remain obstinate; for she is always obstinate if she seeks to clear herself of the accusation.

That is therefore a new indication of guilt; for she would never be so eloquent if she were not a witch. Another day is therefore appointed for her, and if she has truly considered the matter and remained stubborn, then the decree of torture is notified to her. "Thus is now the weak, powerless woman given over to this hellish instrument; after a most careful search of the entire body has previously been conducted, to see whether she might not be carrying some secret charm against the pain. And these pains, they would be unbearable even if they lasted only half a quarter-hour, indeed even only half of that space of time; and now, in defiance of the prohibition by Pope Paul the Third, the time of the still sharpened torture is extended beyond half an hour; indeed the torture is declared insufficient if it does not last a full hour. \[Page 419\]

The very strongest have confessed: the torment is so excessively great that, to be rid of it, they would without scruple confess the very worst crimes, even at the risk of their future salvation. Some, who are convinced that they would be eternally and irretrievably lost if they confessed to such infamy while innocent, struggle long against the monstrous pain, but ultimately succumb; and then, in the dungeon, they fall into the deepest sorrow and despair, because there is no one to raise them up and comfort them. Many are killed by it, others crippled for life: many were so torn and mangled that the executioner did not dare, at the execution, to bare their shoulders before the people; some had to be executed on the way to the court, so that they would not collapse. It is begun with what they call a mild torture, or rather no torture at all; a toothed iron press is placed over the shins, and the flesh is crushed flat with it until the blood spurts out.

The tormented one now perhaps confesses right away; and then she is lost by law. Or she denies it; then the torture is repeated, and doubled, tripled, quadrupled, until her stubbornness is overcome. To be sure, the laws forbid repetition upon the old indications; but for that they have found the expedient of determining the time of the torture at about five quarter-hours, and dividing this over three days. In her agonies the unfortunate one is sharply observed: if she rolls her eyes, then it is judged: See! she is seeking her paramour; but if the eyes remain rigidly open, then it is said: she has found him! If she is silent, then it is the maleficium of taciturnity; if convulsions run through her facial muscles, then it is said: she has laughed; if nature, in the excessive degree of pain, brings sleep over the unfortunate one, then her guilt is proven beyond all doubt; if she becomes clairvoyant, then they have what they wanted; if she dies, then Satan has broken her neck, so that his secret might not come out, and she is now buried under the gallows.

The judges must, for the office which they themselves cannot exercise, make use of other instruments, the executioners; a crude folk, full of malice and hardness of heart, to whom the unfortunate ones now find themselves delivered up as a prize. They regulate the whole business, and carry it out with their cruel coarseness; they question, urge on, press, threaten with wild voices, sharpen the torments at their pleasure. They take pride in the fact that none resists their fury; and those who have then attained to this reputation are sought out and employed before all others. By law, no inquiry into any accomplices by name is to be made, but these tormentors go beyond this; already in the preparation, the victims are encouraged to name this or that one who has come up before: they should not shrink from it and follow good counsel, then milder treatment will also be accorded. \[Page 420\]

For they consider it a disgrace to their art not to master even a weak woman; therefore they also plague the prisoners in every way, already outside the torture, with the filth of the dungeons, frost and heat: until at last, exhausted and broken, they consent to false confessions, which, as has been said, have previously been put into their mouths. With the clergy, one would think, the unfortunates must at least find some refuge. To be sure, the superiors should be only mild, pious folk of good judgment and proven wisdom, men truly permeated by the spirit of religion, who now also know how to test the spirit of men and to fathom the secrets of the heart. But such would fit little with the rest of the proceedings; one would have inconvenient observers in the vicinity, from whom the iniquity of the whole process could not escape.

Such, therefore, are removed as unfit by many courts; only stormy, hot-headed, inexperienced zealots are gladly seen; they, who immediately assert: the guilt admits of no doubt, therefore above all now press for a confession; direct all their efforts toward making her declare herself guilty; seek to deceive her with ambiguous promises, and in such wise join to the bodily torture only a spiritual one besides, which is often continued right up to the edge of the stake. Thus assailed from all sides, torn by pain, a confession is extorted from the unfortunate one; whereupon she herself is then lost, and in the usual course draws others after her into ruin, who are led on the same path to the same end; because she who cannot save herself spares no others either.

But if she does not die on the torture, and does not confess either, so that without new indications one dares neither to torture her further nor to burn her; then she is kept in even closer confinement, perhaps an entire year. For in their blind zeal they want victims, and consider it a disgrace to themselves if they release her all too easily; that would bring them an ill report. Inquiry is made so long until new indications are found; then, to boot, an exorcism is probably also pronounced over her, and she is taken to another place, to break the maleficium of silence; she is then tortured anew, and finally delivered over to the flames nonetheless, where her last cry by no means invalidates the testimony of the torture.

In such wise did things take shape at the courts in the savagery that preceded the Thirty Years' War, mounted ever higher in its course, and continued long after it. Thus around 1616 the Duke of Württemberg had begun the witch-burnings in the towns of Dornstätt, Sindelfingen, Löwenberg, and Baihingen, and the councilors had drawn up special articles on which the officials were to inquire only.

One had captured the Brigitta of Serresheim, whom they called the mother of all lords, on this occasion: when she had breathed into the face of a woman in childbirth, who thereupon became suddenly lame, and the husband of the sick woman had beaten the originator of the evil so long that she had to help her again. She was now arrested in Vaihingen by the deputy bailiff, and she herself requested that they should do her justice, because she had practiced witchcraft since time immemorial. She had killed so many children that it could not be told, well nigh four hundred, among them three that belonged to her own. These had been dug up again, boiled, cooked, partly eaten, used for ointment and lords' craft; but to the pipers the bone tubes had been given as pipes. To her own son she had killed a wife and two children; her two husbands she had lamed for many years and finally killed outright; her whoredom with her paramour had been endless. \[Page 421\]

Countless and harmful storms had she summoned forth these forty years, in the Duchy of Württemberg for several miles along the Heuchelberg, on which mountain the sabbath was held five times yearly; at which there were always nigh two thousand five hundred, poor and rich, young and old, and among them also nobles, gathered together. She said also: if the lords were not there, the Württemberg subjects would drink no water, and in the seventh year would not be permitted to till the fields: moreover, their kitchen vessels would no longer be earthen, but would become silver. She gave as the cause that so many women fell prey to seduction, the mistreatment of them by their drunken husbands; she also pointed out to the judges the marks by which one might recognize them. One sees that the woman was a poison-brewer who had fallen into sorcery, who had prepared her own terrible end for herself; but she now gave occasion to the heedless zeal to rage in like manner against numerous innocents.

Thus it was that in the Bishopric of Würzburg, at the same time, four women had flown into the cellar of a day laborer---probably in a very natural manner---and had drunk out his wine. The torture soon transformed them into witches, and extorted from them also the further testimony: that in the Gerolzhofen tithe there were not sixty persons over seven years old who had remained unacquainted with witchcraft. Of these, first three were taken, then five others again, on the 4th of June thereafter ten, two men and eight women, on the 11th of June again three men and eleven women were drawn in and burned alive; thereupon twenty-six others likewise arrested, and first strangled, then consigned to the flames.

Since the statements of the earlier ones were always confirmed by the later, and thus the great number of the guilty became known, His Princely Grace ordained, and the officials were commanded: henceforth every week, on Tuesday, except when high festivals fall, to hold a burning; and each time twenty-three or twenty, or at the very least---and no fewer than fifteen at once---to stake and burn; and that Your P. Grace would continue and prosecute such through the whole bishopric. To this end all the centgraves had been summoned to Gerolzhofen, and it was announced and earnestly commanded them: to begin the burning of witches, and the list of those who in their time had become known was delivered to them. These then spoke so many wondrous things that they cannot be written down nor brought before the ears of youth. The landlady at the Swan confessed: that she had poisoned many people, and commonly had given musicians cats instead of stockfish, mice and rats instead of birds to eat. A midwife confessed: that she had killed nigh one hundred and ten children, of which twenty-two had been related to her. An old man said and confessed: if he had not been captured within three days, he would have laid waste everything within two-and-twenty miles round about and destroyed it with hail and pebbles. \[Page 422\]

She drove them so harshly that the devil himself stepped in among them and forbade it to them; because it diminished his own realm, and the people, arrogant in good fortune, turned to God in misfortune. But since they would not cease, he had some of them beaten nearly to death, and treated them in such a way that they dared not show themselves for a considerable time; by which means many were also betrayed, and entered into the lord's register¹). One sees that storm damage and child mortality have allied themselves with the torture, some clairvoyance, and some malice, to bring so many people into misfortune. Such fires may have raged there for a considerable time, for in Hauber's library there is found a list of those who, from 1627 until February 1629, within two years and two months, in 20 such fires, 15 in number, were burned.

The greater part are old women and strangers, probably homeless folk; but children are also found among them of twelve, eleven, ten, and nine years; fourteen vicars of the main church, two boys from esteemed families, two little sons of Senator Stolzenburg, a blind girl, and Gobel Babelin, the most beautiful girl in Würzburg.---With most of them it will have been as it was with those of whom George Mackenzie tells: When I presided over a court, I went to question some women more closely who had judicially confessed their guilt. One among them, a simple creature, said to me: she had not confessed because she was guilty, but because she had to live poorly from her work; now, however, being called a witch, she would die of hunger. For no one would take her in any longer, or give her food; rather, they would beat her and set dogs upon her.

Therefore she had wished to be dead; at this she wept bitterly, and tearfully called upon God as witness of the truth of what she had spoken. So it was throughout the British realms, so throughout all of Germany; a bloody scourge had been swung over these lands, worse than the black death this land plague raged in the midst of the most terrible civil wars; and while the sword devoured the men, the flames were sent forth against the women. The enormity of the evil, exceeding all measure, finally had to bring about a reaction. The nature of the battle victims, driven to despair by torment, had already initiated such a thing itself. For a time the tortured had only named their own kind; and thus the fire, once kindled in a village or a town, had run through the whole class, and one had dragged many into perdition. But soon wrath and anger and the bitterness of pain had risen higher, and at last had seized even the judges themselves, who, precisely through the ecstatic side of this pain and of every other passion, had come into the closest rapport with them; and they were named, indeed princes themselves, simultaneously by many, as companions of the Sabbath, testimony being given. Now the right means had been found; their statement had to have validity, for the same signs spoke for them that were valid for the others; the agreement among several was easily given through the rapports; and for the torture there was no different measure and weight. Thus the judges themselves had to be put on trial, just as the accused; and the forms of this process then took care that the accused never escaped. \[Page 423\]

So the flames then turned even more fiercely against those who had themselves sent them forth; just as, in the time of terrorism of our days, the same guillotine devoured all the successively following layers of the parties, one always at the judicial command of the other. The poor women had merely trodden the path to the pyres for their judges, on which they soon afterward wandered after them; now and then also at their side the confessors, who had felt no mercy. And one should imagine only the last moments of these second-order battle-victims, who now held in their hands the conviction that they had been wrongly judged; that they had ruined countless battle-victims without guilt, and now eternal justice had overtaken them on their paths, and they themselves, in atonement for them, had been given over to the same death.

Such proceedings must have aroused doubts, and made the judges cautious; there was need only of one man who--- what the crowd of confessors or court preachers had not been able to do, or not wanted to do, or not dared to do--- also opened the princes' eyes to the true state of affairs. Such a one arose in the Jesuit Spee, and he became a benefactor of humanity thereby, and earned not one but a tenfold civic crown for himself therewith. He lived in the midst of all those horrors, and had probably seen those Franconian fires. His heart bled at the sight of such calamity, and he wrote the *Cautio Criminalis*, which appeared in print for the first time in 1631. Already the better theologians of the time had spoken out against the procedure: and Tanner, Spee's order-brother, had expressed his grave doubts in his *Theology* and made suggestions for mildness, which drew upon him the wrath of the terrorists.

As confessor to many of the executed, Spee had the best opportunity to gain insight into the true state of affairs, and soon convinced himself: that of fifty condemned, not five, indeed perhaps scarcely two, were guilty. Then he wrote his book, without fear of men and without conscienceless timidity; from which we above communicated an excerpt of the description of the procedure, in which he uncovers the whole iniquity of this fury. Therewith he stepped before the princes, explaining to them: how the judges excused this their procedure through constant pressure from above; how that was, however, a grave matter of conscience not only for their councils and confessors, but also for themselves; and how they all would one day have to give account thereof before the higher judge.

They should consult the theologians about it, and those would give them information: that one may not trifle with human blood, and human heads one may not throw away lightly like skittles, as the lord-judges now permitted themselves to do, who hastened to the torture at the slightest rumor, and even interrogated under torture those for whom piety and a blameless life bore witness. We all must one day to the judgment-seat of eternity, he says, and if there every useless word must be accounted for, what will happen with such bloody deeds? That did not remain without impression; one lost the confidence that one was on good paths with this whole blood-justice; and when one first looked closely, one discovered the horrible thing in the matter.

Gradually now the pyres went out; the movement went forth from the Main and Rhine, and soon spread over all Germany. He, from whom it had first taken its origin, had not expected the reward of the world; but it would not let itself be deprived of discharging its debt to him. He had converted the place Peina back to the church through his zeal. \[Page 424\]

The enemies of the Church in Hildesheim had therefore, as he was on the way to the place to hold the divine service, like the Frisians the holy Boniface, caused him to be ambushed; and he had sustained five significant wounds on the head, and two others on the back, but nonetheless held the church service to the point of collapse. Some years later, in 1635, he died in the Trier region, in the 48th year of his age. After him, however, among the Protestants, D. J. M. Meyfart, Director of the Gymnasium in Coburg, must be honorably mentioned.

In the time of Maximilian I, he wrote: *Christian Reminder to Powerful Rulers and Conscientious Preachers, How the Abominable Vice of Witchcraft Is to Be Earnestly Eradicated, but in Its Persecution on Pulpits and in Court Houses to Be Handled with Great Moderation*. It is only a paraphrase of the book by Spee; but from his youth onward he had often seen how things were done in the Protestant courts; how no sleep was allowed to the prisoners and they were awakened with sharp thorns when they closed their eyes; how they were given only food salted with herring brine, but not a drop of water was granted them. He had seen how, in his words, the executioners and tormentors held the precious body of man in such low esteem, how they shamefully distorted and shattered it; driving the limbs apart from one another, forcing the eyes from the head, tearing the feet from the shins, dislocating the joints from the tendons, lifting the shoulder blades from the scapula, causing the veins to swell; jerking the unfortunates now upward, and again hurling them to the ground, and turning the underside to the top.

He saw how quarrels, envy, anger, strife, backbiting, and talebearing usually gave the first occasion for the accusation; beginning with grumbling and muttering, and then publicly accusing this or that one of sorcery. Then he heard how the preachers were drawn in, blind zealots who spared no one, loading their sermons with fiery bolts, bursting forth in their own brain-madness and stubborn defiance, and crying out for chains and bonds, for towers and dungeons, for wood and straw, smoke and fire, powder and sulfur; now imagining that this was to follow the saying of the Lord: *Learn from me, for I am meek, and humble of heart*. \[Page 425\]

Then he saw the witchcraft councils seize with iron hands, and in the most secret of all sins proceed without any moderation; he was a witness how the poor folk at their command were broken, whipped, screwed apart, torn asunder, crushed, ripped, devastated, corrupted, and laid waste; how the scold's cart rumbled daily through the streets, and yet the scolds hourly became more numerous; so that the Thuringian forests would not suffice to burn them all. All this he had seen, and his heart too was set aflame, and he cried out his woe over the perpetrators. *So now be instructed, ye kings, and be chastened, ye judges on earth! All ye kings, princes and rulers, ye centgraves, ye assessors, ye witchcraft clerks, executioners, tormentors! Ye must one day give account for every word that was commanded: to capture, to whip and behead and burn; for every mockery with which ye taunted the poor tormented ones; for every tear they wept out, for every drop they bled out!* So cried the worthy man in his indignation, and his words too were not spoken in vain on this side. Therefore, when at the beginning of the eighteenth century, from Thomasius downward, the Rationalists arrived, everything had long since been settled. Their merit is only that they set limits to the all-too-great credulity in this field; in exchange for which complete unbelief now broke in. On the threshing floor where these had been trampled about, no blade of grass grew anymore, neither herb nor weed; and it became now the riding school where they practiced their circling, and still practice to this hour.

### Chapter 3. The Church's Relation to the Abuses of the Heresy Process

The matters had arranged themselves in such a way that, if the heresy system itself---in its terrible earnestness, and in that which of truth had been in it---had arisen from an abominable perversion of human nature, the manner in which one sought to curb it, because it was carried out with cold blood, had been almost even more abominable, so that evil had gained the upper hand, and where the victims escaped it, had found ample compensation in judges and executioners. And it had not generally been rage and wrath and fury and cruelty that had inspired such proceedings; rather, a blind, imprudent, and immoderate zeal had originally brought it forth; and the insensibility of men, combined with laxity, indifference, and apathy, had then carried it further, and driven it to the extreme. The same imprudent zeal had also, not long before, called forth the religious movements; but the same laxity and indifference, at the pleasure of the rulers, had let religious convictions be prescribed to them, changed, and again and a third time other and ever other ones forced upon them. \[Page 426\]

The same negligence had given up almost everything that should be valuable to man in society---fatherland, freedom, constitution, unity, old customs and memories, even the language; and had brought about that state of complete dissolution in which the peoples became the mockery of their neighbors. When a feeling of such disgrace finally awoke, one had sought to shift the blame from oneself and roll it over onto forms and institutions, making them responsible for what one had sinned oneself. That is the way of men; they know full well what religion means, they also know the Gospels, and they understand very well how to speak of the love that Christianity demands of them; but in practice they know how to keep free from such transcendences. On the theaters they amuse themselves with the tragic struggles of their heroes with fate, and let themselves, with attentive emotion, be indoctrinated with great words and principles, and their Posa's, kneeling on one knee, hold grand speeches to the tyrant about pride and freedom; however, under a silent agreement, they take their own greatest servility not amiss, and mutually forgive each other the slight impropriety. So then, the princes and their tyrannical laws alone should answer for the common guilt; but chiefly it is the religion that has caused the whole scandal.

The Popes, especially Innocent VI, have given the signal, and the Inquisition has now gone forth like a ravenous-hungry lioness, seeking whom she may devour. But it had not been the forms that did it, the laws had not brought it about; rather, the way in which they were executed had caused the evil. The laws were indeed superfluously bloody, according to the spirit of that time; they had, in this spirit, also well incorporated the torture; but they had fenced it in carefully, as a fragile and dangerous thing; men, however, under the pretense of exceptional cases, had torn down the enclosure, and had now proceeded against heretics and hereticesses in their merciless manner. Thus this form of process had not flowed from the well of justice; rather, from the proud and cowardly thing, the human heart, it had found its way. Even less had religion cooperated in it, or the Church hired the torture-masters, and now through the Popes issued their full authority to them. \[Page 427\]

Just under the eyes of the Popes the evil raged most mildly; it had, as we have seen, already begun centuries before Innocent VI; all peoples on this side of the Alps and beyond were infected by it; but the proceedings had increased in cruelty in proportion as they withdrew from the direct influence of the Church; and had reached their utmost height precisely when those peoples had either decidedly fallen away from her, or at least inclined toward apostasy. The Popes had to take notice of so momentous a matter, in which the peoples believed, and had sent out the Inquisitors against the evil. That Bull of Innocent was intended only to protect the authority established for the regions along the Rhine, where the evil had recently spread anew, in its sphere of action against objections, and confirmed its right: to act in improving, arresting, and punishing ways; granting them permission, precisely in order to carry out the first part of this office, to expound the Word of God to the people in all the parish churches of their district as often as it might be needed, and to provide and arrange everything useful for their instruction according to their own discretion. Whatever they may have sinned in weakness, through excess or deficiency, and in error; the authorization for it lay at least not in the mandate that they had received. On the contrary, one must also bear witness here to the Popes, that they consistently proceeded in a moderating and mitigating manner, and, carefully following the spirit of the times, endeavored to incorporate the gained insight always into a better practice.

This relation of the Church to the whole abomination is best demonstrated from the Instructions for the Processes in Matters of Witches, Sorcerers, and Malefactors, which appeared in 1657 in the printing house of the Apostolic Chamber in Rome. At the beginning it states: Experience, the great teacher in all things, has clearly shown: how the gravest errors in the procedural conduct against the business of witchcraft are committed, to the detriment of justice and of the accused women; so that in the General Congregation of the holy, Roman, and universal Inquisition against heretical malfeasance, it has long been observed: how scarcely ever has a process of this kind been conducted regularly and in legal form. Therefore the necessity has often arisen to censure many judges reprovingly for the unjust vexations, inquisitions, incarcerations, and all manner of evil and inappropriate methods of procedure in conducting the processes; for unauthorized interrogation of the defendants, and the imposition of inhuman tortures; whereby it has come about that exceedingly many unjust death sentences or handovers to the secular arm have occurred. Many judges, as the same experience has shown, have proven so frivolous and credulous: that they, on the slightest grounds of suspicion, have held any woman to be a witch; and then have left nothing undone to extort from such an accused person, even by unlawful means, a confession that, improbable, changeable, and contradictory as it is, deserves little or no credence.

Therefore, so that the judges henceforth may conduct such processes more cautiously, they shall always keep the following before their eyes and consider it. The writing now sets forth at length on the subject, viewing it entirely from a sensible, equitable, and life-experienced perspective. A chief error of the judges, it says, is that they believe: one may proceed not only to inquisition, but even to arrest, indeed to torture, even if no corpus delicti of a maleficium is present. But such a maleficium must above all lie proven in a legal manner, and for that it is by no means sufficient, as many believe, that the maleficiated person has fallen ill, or even died; because illness and death do not necessarily follow from the maleficium. \[Page 428\]

With the greatest diligence, therefore, the physicians of the sick must first be questioned as to whether they regard the illness and death as natural. They must write down the entire course in a verbal process in full detail, so that in the event of their inexperience a better physician may review their judgment. Moreover, the household members of the sick person shall be examined regarding the origin and course of the illness, so that their statements may be compared with those of the physicians, and the judge may then form a well-founded judgment from all of it. Before a judge orders the arrest, he must first have carefully weighed all the indications against the accused, and not allow himself to be led into hasty arrest by the complaints of the alleged injured party and his kin; without any probable ground being present that might have induced the accused to the misdeed. But if the arrest is indeed imposed, then let the judge, in person or through a capable deputy, take good care to see what relevant things are found in her house; but not merely considering what accuses her, but also such things as may justify her.

He shall take impartial witnesses to his aid in this, but exclude the alleged injured parties and their kin. He shall not judge rashly that oil in vessels, ointments, powders, and the like belong to witchcraft; but rather let the things found be first carefully examined by experts. If the relatives of the sick person bring things that they claim to have found in the bed, then let him not hastily regard them as the corpus delicti; it may easily be that they were merely planted there to secure a conviction. Feathers and wool can easily become so intertwined during bed-making that very natural combinations arise which are passed off as maleficia. Needles too are plentiful everywhere women are present; one must therefore not be surprised if by chance many of them are found together. Already the casting out of such needles from the possessed can serve as a warning to proceed with caution.

Many exorcists are in the habit of imprudently questioning the demon: whether he gained entry through a maleficium, and who performed it? The answer then comes from the father of lies in the affirmative and accusatory, and upon this a process is sometimes immediately founded against those named; but the holy Congregation has always sharply rebuked exorcists and judges in such cases. Many judges imagine that because someone shows signs of being possessed, he must also have been bewitched; and thereon they have built unjust processes against persons who are hostile to the possessed, or otherwise denounced. But this is utterly absurd; for who can deny that the demon, by divine permission without any maleficium, may torment the body of a human being? Let the judges therefore beware of this snare; and also of that which false, deceitful possessed lay for them. \[Page 429\]

Judges shall not readily lend themselves to exercising violence upon a witch or a malefactress merely on the basis of outcry; although otherwise reputation is of great importance. For amid the common hatred against this class of people, all are easily inclined to rise up against them, and to raise such an outcry on slight occasion; especially if the woman is moreover old and ugly. Therefore no reliance shall be placed upon it, and the judge shall first investigate its origin. He shall always take into consideration that the female sex is superstitious, and devoted to all manner of arts, especially in matters of love; that therefore from the fact that one has practiced such things, and spoken charms to heal maleficia or to bind the will, it by no means immediately follows that she is a formal witch; because such practices are not necessarily conjoined with apostasy. The judge shall thus not immediately assume the merely possible as actual, and hold himself justified in leaving nothing undone to extort a confession of things to which she may perhaps never have given a thought, on the basis of such truly forbidden exercises of that sort.

The judges may therefore not permit that a woman arrested on this account should have intercourse with anyone from outside, or---if there have been several of them---with these among themselves; because many are of the opinion that it is permitted to bear false witness against themselves in matters of apostasy, in the hope of being set free sooner. They shall also never allow their guardians, or whoever it may be, to advise them what they should say in the interrogation; because experience has shown that the women, deceived by such counsel, often confess what they had never before dreamed of. Outside the interrogation, the judges themselves shall never engage with them on the matter. In the interrogation, nothing may be put into their mouths, but they shall only be questioned: whether they know or suspect the reason for their examination? what enemies they have, and what cause they have given for enmity? How they have conducted their lives, how they have observed the sacraments, who has been their confessor? and the like, what allows a conclusion about their conduct.

Then they may be questioned in general: whether they know anything of sorcery? If they deny it, then what is on record in the files concerning such matters may gradually be brought in; however, with the withholding of the names of the witnesses. If they persist in denial, then after the conclusion of the informational process, one may proceed to the witnesses of the accusatory process. The fiscal must articulate certain points for this purpose; a copy thereof shall be communicated to the defendants, and a suitable advocate shall be assigned to them; ex officio, if they, out of poverty or otherwise, have accepted none. Moreover, the necessary time limit shall also be granted to them. If this part of the process has also run its course, then a copy of the whole shall be given to them, and a new period for defense shall be set. If this has also been heard, then the judges shall convene an assembly of legal experts; the entire process shall be read to them, as before with the withholding of the names of the witnesses; and if these are not unanimous in their judgment, or if it is a grave matter, either with respect to the crime or to the person, one shall not proceed to torture until the holy Congregation has been consulted, to which a faithful copy of the double process must therefore be sent. \[Page 430\]

But if it should seem to the judges and their assembly that one could immediately proceed to torture in the face of pressing indications, they shall not be questioned on the crime in detail; but beforehand, the raised indications shall once more be laid before them, and on the rack itself they shall only be questioned on the truth in general, with respect to what has been presented. If they begin to confess, then in the further course nothing may be put into their mouths; but only the words of their testimony shall be written down, and the truth in the whole shall then be further inquired of them. The torture may not be of the rending kind (squasso), not torment with attached weights or sticks at the feet, nor constrict with ropes. The judges shall not lightly order a repetition of it, except in the gravest cases, and after obtaining approval from the holy Congregation.

The women shall not be shorn on the body, nor shall any weight be placed on alleged marks, if, for example, they shed no tears. The torture shall never be continued longer than one hour, and shall only reach this duration in the gravest cases and the most pressing indications, and the imposed duration shall also be noted in the records. In the case that women have also confessed to apostasy, and their presence at the Sabbath, the judges shall take care that the confessors, without any instigation, tell them: how they came to it in the beginning; they shall inform themselves about the time and circumstances, so that one may recognize therefrom whether their confession is probable.

In the case that they state facts pertaining to the verification, the judges shall apply all diligence to verify these truly; because, if they should be found false, the confession itself would also be invalidated, as one given perhaps through torture, a deceitful means, or through suggestion from somewhere, or through impatience over the imprisonment; whereby the judges must by no means allow themselves to be biased by what they may have read among the writers on the matter. But if such women have also confessed authentically, and named accomplices, then proceedings shall never be instituted against those named, on the basis of their testimony; because everything could have occurred through illusion, and justice does not require that one proceed against accomplices seen in the illusion.

The entire procedure of the judges shall be recorded precisely in the records; so that, upon reading them, one may always be able to judge it worthily. Many judges are accustomed to give no other cause for the trial than rumor; henceforth they shall avoid this error, and state the persons and circumstances that brought it to their ears, and record everything, omitting nothing. Children are often smothered in their beds by their caretakers; the judges should take care to see precisely whether, in order to conceal such things, it has not been stated in a given case: that the witch had killed them. In all these trials, the fees prescribed by the holy Congregation shall never be exceeded; and in the case of poverty, the judges shall guard against every unjust extortion. \[Page 431\]

This instruction, which we have communicated not by selection but in its entire scope, does the chamber all honor; it is pure, sound human understanding, a circumspect and insightful practice, humanity, equity, and mercy in it; to the shame of the torturers who instigated and carried out that abominable mischief. It must necessarily have put an end to the barbaric naturalism of the courts, and led the procedure back into an orderly course of trial; which, though it still does not guard against all error, yet makes it rarer and more accountable before God. The practice prescribed here was the same that, more than a century and a half earlier, the worthy judges of Del Rio had already followed; in it, therefore, the view of the Church on the matter is expressed.

Even in the particulars, the clerics who acted in its spirit and according to the mildness of the doctrine arranged their procedure according to similar principles. They understood: that everywhere it depends more on the improvement and instruction of the unfortunates than on the intervention of a bloody terrorism; which only incites the wild, rending beast in man to lust, in order to tear it to pieces. This is already evident in the manner in which Father Surin treated the obsessed in the convent of Loudun.

Here he did not wield the sharpness of the sword, not even did he make frequent use of exorcism; for he understood: that above all he himself, with his person, must stand surety for those entrusted to him. He therefore first turned in persistent prayer to God and his saints, the Virgin at their head, that help might come to him from there; and he held himself, during the course of many years, unceasingly in this prayerful communion. And the spirits cried out in the possessed: that this was the way to torment them and bring them to ruin. Into the same communion he soon also drew the obsessed Johanna; and as she too learned to maintain herself persistently in it, one of her spirits was thereby alone, without exorcism, compelled to depart.

He further judged that the main reason for the connection of man with the demon lay in the sins and evil habits of the former; all the more so, the deeper these were rooted; thus that in the measure in which sin was more present in a soul, all the more the devil would take root in it and triumph. Therefore, one must above all strive to eradicate this main cause, and thereby weaken the powers of the demon. This was also acknowledged by the spirits, as they cried out again: We have no more than what the vices of men give us; if these are eradicated, then we must succumb and depart from here.

He therefore continually exercised Johanna in the struggle with these her evil inclinations of the corrupted nature; her progress therein was soon attested by the spirits, who threatened him because he was introducing a completely new method, and offered themselves to all obedience if only he would cease therewith; for it was the greatest misfortune for them on earth to possess a mortified person, whose slaves they would be, instead of ruling her in her evil inclinations. She still had four spirits, and Father Surin devised the plan to attack each in his own stronghold. The one who drove her to all pranks, and the other who drove her to all pleasures; both he subdued by instilling in her the spirit of a earnestly strict penitence. She slept therefore on the hard ground, scarcely made any fire, scourged herself three times a day most sharply, wore a cilice and a chain around her body, fasted almost always, abstained from all fruits that she loved, and also ate with it many things that seemed to burden her in her stomach weakness. \[Page 432\]

Thereupon he also attacked the other spirits, who had taken up position in the proud-anger part, and combated them with humility and patience. When she therefore boasted under the impulse of her spirits; then he had her thrown down by beggars, trampled with muddy feet, and struck on the mouth. He sent her to the sister cook with the request: to give her a discipline, which the latter then performed quite simply. He made her publicly ashamed, for which she always thanked him afterward, and begged him to tell every man all her sins that she had confessed to him in a general confession. As she could not obtain this from him, she herself confessed before her fellow sisters her greatest and most shameful sins, and also made a vow to become a lay sister.

In the same way he combated the natural laziness in her, kept watch over all her gestures, words, and works, killed off in them everything that he noted as wrong, proceeding in each from the principle that the improvement of souls is more a work of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and of prayer than of science. The spirits let their impatience and displeasure appear in the course of the whole procedure: that they were forced to remain in a place where no nourishment and no space was left for them. But the purpose was achieved as desired; the demons departed one after another, each marking the forehead or hand with the name of a helpful saint or a cross.

The spiritual therapy of the father was, as one sees, not a palliative or symptomatic one; but a thorough one, which went to the root of the evil, and uprooted and mortified it. It was now certainly not the business of the judges to proceed in such ways; but they had to let the accused, through those called to it, first be guided on them; and if they showed themselves there unamendable and incurable, but to deny it is certainly impossible in any way, since the evil has become a great national scourge; that it would also have required a great institution extending over the infected parts of the land, in order to effectively combat the infection that had spread so widely.

The Church has always known how to set limits to such secular plagues through such institutions; and it is at first glance surprising that nothing of the sort was undertaken on a grand scale from her side. When in the preceding age Manichaeism, in the moral laxity of the century, took root in a threatening manner; then highly inspired men, Dominic and Francis of Assisi, set their orders against it: the one forming the spiritual knighthood of the Crusaders; the other sent out to instruct the misled people. The undertaking succeeded as desired; the poisonous mushroom that had grown out of the decay was eradicated; but the two orders outlived the danger against which they had been equipped. Manichaeism, gathering itself together and retreating precisely to its most poisonous principle, had shrouded itself in night and secrecy; and though it was thereby removed from the daylight side of humanity, it had for that very reason infected its night side all the more, and there laid out the entire apparatus of sorcery and witchcraft, in which it henceforth lost itself. The institutions that had combated it on its earlier exoteric side had now to follow it into this esoteric concealment, and continue the struggle begun on the outside now also in these inner realms. \[Page 433\]

Two things were to be done in this: first, to ward off the further spread of the evil through better instruction; and then to eradicate what had spread through suitable means, of which the last appeared to be punishment distributed according to justice. The two orders had to divide the work between them: the lesser brethren, hastening to the infected regions or summoned there, had to form unceasing missions that instructed the poor, downtrodden, ignorant, misled people, and enlightened them about the goal and end of the path that many had taken merely out of ignorance of a better one. They had to win it back from the deception to the truth, and know how to occupy the misled forces that, in the absence of a worthy counterforce, had attached themselves to the unworthy.

If the evil was in this way isolated by cutting off the tributaries and driven back to definite organs; then the other order, that of the Preachers, might take over the spiritual jurisdiction of this now surveyable and controllable herd of perdition; and make the ascetic improvement, guidance, and healing of the deadly wounds its vocation. Always having such a religious-moral influenza before their eyes in the most remarkable examples, it could not be difficult for the order, with some attention, to penetrate to the innermost core of them, to see through their nature and essence, and in its tradition a mass of facts had to accumulate in this way that made these Christian priests just as insightful physicians of the spiritual evil as those of antiquity had raised themselves to knowledgeable experts in poisonous ills on a similar path. What proved itself mortally struck and incurable could then be handed over to the secular arm; but even here the acquired insights still imposed on the members of the order the obligation to appear as advisers to the judges and defenders of the accused; and where a ray of hope was still present, to hold back the utmost from the unfortunate. Without doubt that shameful blot would then not have come into the history of many peoples, and the two orders would first have fully fulfilled the purpose of their foundation. But corporations, like individual persons, like to rest on the laurels they have once won.

It was necessary that this entry into a new form of their vocation should be preceded by a new metamorphosis of their own form; for this, a new generation of men equally inspired by God was required, such as their founders had been. But the times had grown old; the forces that had formerly been at work had dried up, the enthusiasm had cooled. The men whom the Church needed did not come forward; the peoples had withdrawn from the great history, and each one arranged its domestic affairs; the great institutions, which had formerly encompassed all things, therefore gradually fell into ruin, and every people was left to its own worldly understanding.

Thus have things turned out, not as they should have, but as they could; in miserably torn Germany, in the most miserable manner; and those who had forfeited their lives on the pyre became likewise the sacrificial victims of the bad order; just as later those thousands who bled to death on the battlefields of foreigners, sold by their leaders for base Mammon. The injustice that befell them---one must cherish faith in the higher world order, that they have found their compensation there anew; here below they have at least not died entirely in vain, even if the acquisition could have been gained at a cheaper price. However clumsily and unskillfully one may have proceeded, the experience could not be wholly lost; the facts have accumulated, and it has become possible for the spirit to order and penetrate them; so that the state of affairs lies clearly before one's eyes. \[Page 434\]

One knows better the scope of the means over which nature disposes; one has penetrated deeper into the secret workshop where her forces work wonders that no longer inspire terror and dismay. One knows better the nature of those nocturnal men who wander about dreaming by day, because the old night with all its horrors and monsters has taken up residence in the dark regions of their temperament, and there now broods something sinister, which one no longer holds to be worthy of death. One distinguishes those who have entangled themselves with evil and thereby caused harm from those who have refrained from misdeeds; already Charlemagne commanded that the former be duly punished, but the latter be handed over to the bishop so that he might convert them.

In future cases one would follow this example, and thus the return of the mischief has become impossible forever. But just as one has found occasion to recognize the bright side of human nature in the saints, so has one here also recognized the reverse side; opposite every radiant point there, one has found in it also a nodal point of the night: the one testifies for the other, as the one covers the other. Thus all phenomena have their place, and with it their guarantee; and it is no longer necessary to gaze at them with stupid, superstitious wonder, and to be excessively frightened by them; or with equal rationalistic stupidity to deny them, and for that reason senselessly to reject the testimony of incredible facts. The whole region is thus, with regard to its earthly side, taken up into the circle of our knowledge, and can henceforth neither oppress nor alarm us; because even the transcendent element in these phenomena, in this its knowable aspect, by no means withdraws itself from the laws of our spirit.

But thereby the sting is also drawn from evil for the future, that it, if it should perhaps emerge anew in masses, might become a terrible weapon of evil. It can no longer overawe or bewitch us; for even if malice should succeed in mastering it as an instrument for enforcing its claims, it could not succeed in mastering the masses with it in the long run.

But the Church, in that she would confront the enemy not only through the power entrusted to her, so now also through her knowledge and insight, and completely subdue him, would only find the opportunity to glorify herself in him.
