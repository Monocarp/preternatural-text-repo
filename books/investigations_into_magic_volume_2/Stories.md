'VAIN FUTILITY once conjoined with MARVEL in a furtive copulation and gave birth to a MAGIC with the name 'favourable'. Dreading lest by chance TRUTH, (with which [Vain Futility] is perpetually engaged in hostilities, which she has also fought in close combat, and in which she has often been beaten), would kill off her offspring, handed it over, by conjugal agreement, to a married couple, SHAMELESSNESS and FEAR. But straight away they secretly laid it in the lap of INCOMPREHENSIBILITY to be brought up under the influence of the cradle-songs of CONJURING-TRICKS. [Magic] soon grew up and then, furnished with little wings, it flew off to the FORTRESS OF FOOLS, and there built a nest and gave birth to CREDULITY who, in gratitude for the kindnesses of her parent, nourishes [Magic] and loves her back], as though [Magic] should shortly die if she did not.'

Caesarius of Heisterbach tells the story of a nobleman from the territory of Liège who made a pact of this kind.²² The evil spirit, however, was heard speaking but was not seen, and at this point the young man, along with everything else he did, was ill-advised enough to deny his Creator with a gesture of renunciation and do homage to the devil.

On this subject, too, I should make reference to what Archdeacon Theophilus did, according to Sigebert. 'In order to recover his position, he sought help from the Prince of evil spirits, who ordered him to deny Christ, the Son of God, and His mother Mary, along with every tenet of Christianity, to confirm this denial in writing, to sign what he had written, to hand over the signed document to him, and to bind himself to his service'. In the latter instance, the witness was a magician, in the former the Superintendent of Iniquity.²³

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 6-7</div>
Sometimes they do this via a little book of humble requests which they present to the Devil. In our own day, for example, magicians from Mantes-laJolie in Normandy, wrote a little book which they were going to offer to the Sibyls, the guardians of necromantic magic. Briefly, it said that (i) they begged the Ladies to deign to consecrate the [magicians'] books of magic so that evil spirits [spiritus] would obey them quickly in every way in conformity with the formulae of invocation contained in the books, and that when they were invoked they would appear to them, without doing them harm, in the shape of a good-looking human being, and that they would not have to make any circle or enter houses or go into the fields; (ii) that the Sibyls would stamp their sign or character on the books, (there were three of them), so that the books would have more effectiveness and dominance over the foresaid spirits [spiritus]; (iii) that the petitioners were to be kept safe from judges' traps and the punishment [they inflict]; (iv) that everything they started and their endeavours to get a friendly reception at the courts of princes were to be successful and prosper, and that they were to make money by gambling whenever they wanted; (v) that their enemies should not be able to do them harm. In return for these [requests], they promised in their turn that, on the very day their books were consecrated, they would regard the foresaid Sibyls as their mistresses and princes in perpetuity and offer them an individual soul every year for as long as they lived, (that is, they would murder and sacrifice a human being, or certainly initiate him into their ritual of unbelief.) But according to their binding agreement, the Sibyls were to provide these people in good faith with what they had demanded. (They were all burned in Paris, along with their books.

<div align="center"><b>The Witch's Confession Before the Devil</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 9-9</div>
'This woman, in hope of saving her life, gave an account of everything from beginning to end. This acknowledgement of her requires individual headings to express it all. First, she said that her [Novice] Mistress brought her in front of the judgement-seat of their prince, he being the Devil in the form of a king seated upon a throne of majesty. The [Novice] Mistress had instructed her beforehand what she should do, so she came forward and first was obliged to deny her baptism and abandon all the teachings of the Christian faith'. (Here you have apostasy.) 'Then she had to cast aside all the Church's sacraments, and trample underfoot the cross and images of the Blessed Virgin Mary and other saints.' (Here you have sacrilege.) 'They do not do these last in front of the Devil but do them elsewhere later on. It is enough that they promise to do them'. (Here you have the profession). 'Then she made her vow by means of a solemn engagement, [putting her hands] in the prince's hands. She vowed and promised she would always be faithful to him, be obedient to him, and obey all his commandments'. (Here you have the vow.)

'Then, in the midst of her oath-taking, she touched [some] characters written on the outside of a large book containing pages which were hidden away, and did homage or perpetual vassalage', (here you have homage,) '[saying] she would never return to the faith of Christ, or keep God's commandments, but that she would pay attention only to those [issued] by the prince himself, and that in future she would be obedient to him and could come every time when summoned to [his] revels and assemblies. [She also promised] to do what the other women did during those [assemblies], and also that she would be present at their nocturnal sacrifices and would [make] the customary prayers and attend the ceremony of adoration'. (Here you have idol-madness.) 'She would fulfil, to the best of her ability, whatever vows [the prince] might happen to put in front of her and bring as many people as she could to [make] this same profession'. (Here you have the declaration.) 'On his part, however, the prince himself, with surpassing effrontery, promised to give this woman in front of him everlasting happiness, grandiose things, immeasurable things, and whatever pleasures she wanted to have in this world, and that at long last, after this life, she would obtain greater gifts [than these]'.

<div align="center"><b>Théodore Maillot and the Evil Spirit's Deception</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 13-14</div>
In Book 1, chapter 9 of his Worship of Evil Spirits, Nicolas Rémy describes Théodore Maillot as follows.

'When he was an old man, he obtained the governorship of a province in a huge kingdom. [This province] comes under the jurisdiction of Lorraine. While he was still a young man, he was desperate to marry a young woman from a very splendid family. All hope of his being able to achieve this had been torn from him and snatched away because he had no money and was of humble stock. He was an apprentice engaged in trade which, at that time, meant he was low-born and despised. So, he saw no sufficiently honourable way of even making his love known. Therefore, as people in hopeless situations, when expectation itself deserts them, easily turn to any kind of plan and embrace it without any thought whether they should shun it or follow it, Maillot went to a fellow-servant from Germany [because] he had been told that this man had an evil spirit who was prepared to be compliant in every respect. He opened up to him and told him what was making him ill and begged him not to begrudge him a remedy if he could provide him with one. His kindness, [he said], would not go unrewarded. The German willingly seized his opportunity because, in accordance with his pact, in a few days' time he either had to free and disengage himself from the evil spirit by bringing him someone else who would transfer this debt to himself or incur another one, or be put to death and killed at the hands [of the evil spirit] who would twist and break his neck, (because this stipulation had been added to the pact.)

So, in order to carry out his plan, he agreed they should meet the following day at daybreak in an out-of-the-way room which would be locked and have its shutters drawn. They had scarcely got there when the doors suddenly opened and in came an elegant young woman with a generous figure. (The evil spirit wanted to show himself in this form first so that Maillot would not become terrified at his frightening appearance.) She announced she was the woman who would easily get him the marriage he wanted so badly, provided he was willing to follow the instructions she would give him. He was all agog and eagerly waited to hear whatever she would tell him [to do]. The first thing she started with was an instruction to abstain from theft, drunkenness, lust, blasphemy, and every other sin which defiles the soul. [Then she said] he should cultivate devout behaviour, support the needy from his resources, and weaken himself twice a week by fasting. He was not to neglect [the Church's] feast-days, he should pray every day, and he must unremittingly attend to all the things it was proper and fitting for a Christian to do. If he was willing to bind himself by a formal vow [to do] all this, the result would be that there would be no difficulty in his obtaining the marriage he wanted. Once she had said this and appointed a day by which she would receive his answer, she left hastily. Maillot, who could see that such holy and respectable conditions made a benefit of such importance to him obtainable, now began to think there was no point in delaying and that he should gratefully and willingly accept [her proposal]. But while he was giving the matter more and more thought and being driven hither and thither in different ways between hope and fear, a member of the household, who was a priest, guessed from the expression on his face that he was concealing something which was perplexing him. He approached him gently, found out what was troubling him, and with his advice prevailed on Maillot not to stoop to any further conversation with the evil spirit. The German was thus deceived in his expectation, and it was not long before he paid the penalty laid down in his pact, because not many days later, on a level open road, he tumbled from his horse, fell heavily to the ground, and was found to have died in an instant'. This is what Rémy says.

<div align="center"><b>The Exposed Fraud of the Vanishing Sacrificial Victim at Paneas</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 23-23</div>
Astyrius disclosed a fraud, the perpetration of which Eusebius rescued from oblivion. 'At Caesarea Philippi, which the Phoenicians calls "Paneas", a sacrificial victim is brought to springs which burst out there from the lower slopes of Mount Paneion. (These springs are said to be the source of the [River] Jordan.) On one of the pagans' feast-days [the victim] was slaughtered, thrown [into the water] and, through the force and power of an evil spirit, vanished from people's sight in an extraordinary way. Those who were present thought this a most remarkable miracle. Astyrius happened to be there on one occasion while this was taking place, and when he saw so many people astounded by it, he was very distressed by their mistaken belief. So, he looked up at the sky and humbly entreated God, the ruler of everything, through Christ to restrain the evil spirit who had shat⁷¹ on the people by leading them so badly astray, and to control him because of the fraud and deceits he is in the habit of practising against human beings. When he had prayed to God this way, the sacrificial victim suddenly floated on top of the springs, and so the [spectacle] it had been their custom to find so astonishing was completely ruined, so much so that in future no miracle would ever take place there again'.

In this category one must include the illusions of a Jew, Zedekiah, who lived at the time of Louis the Devout [778-840]. He would throw a man into the air, tear him to pieces, collect the pieces together, and reunite them again, and he would also swallow a cart laden with hay, together with its horses and driver, in the presence of the entire population.

<div align="center"><b>The Delusion of Praestantius's Father</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 25-25</div>
However, when an evil spirit convinces human beings they have been changed into animals, he does not merely change the organ but sometimes the medium as well, and he always changes the imagination at the same time, as in the case of Praestantius's father, described by St Augustine. The Devil, you see, can put together and arrange semblances of things in such a way that even while someone is awake, (which is what St Augustine says), he will dream as people who are asleep do, and think he is feeling things he does not feel, the way mad people do.

<div align="center"><b>Magicians' Illusion of a Springing River</b></div>

An example of the first is when magicians put a bow made from a particular wood in a room and shoot an arrow made from a different wood from a string of a particular thickness. When they do this, they make it seem as though a river as wide as the flight of the arrow has sprung up in that place.

Likewise in the incident reported by Nicetas about a counterfeit snake.
'When, from a rather high place in the palace at Constantinople, Michael Sicydites saw a skiff which was carrying pots and dishes, he [uttered] a magical incantation and made a sailor get up and carry on breaking the pottery until he had reduced it to dust. But not long afterwards he seized hold of his beard and began to weep and, once his mental blindness had cleared, he started to wail that he had been driven [to do it] as though by the wrath of a divinity. Asked why he had treated his merchandise this way, he told a painful story. He was concentrating on his rowing, [he said], when he saw a dreadful snake stretched out on top of the pots. With unblinking eyes, it turned towards him as though it was going to devour him and did not stop coiling itself up until the earthenware had been shattered. Then suddenly it vanished from his eyes'.

<div align="center"><b>Eon's Bewitching of Eyes</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 26-26</div>
William of Newburgh testifies to the conjuring-tricks of Eon, a heretic and a magician. 'He used to bewitch [fascinasse] people's eyes so that they thought there was a great crowd of men in front of them, and an abundance of delicious food fit for a king, and the most magnificent furniture'. At length, however, he was sentenced at the Council of Rheims, and while he was being led to his death he quite frequently said to the earth, 'Earth, open up!' a fruitless attempt we read about in Robert's Chronicle.

<div align="center"><b>Jakob Melstinki's Impersonation of Christ and the Apostles</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 26-28</div>
This is how the evil spirit amuses himself with conjuring-tricks and, not content with imitating miracles by means of conjuring-tricks, tries to represent those very conjuring-tricks to heretics [as miracles] by means of crafty deceits as well. I have read an example [of this] which was so delightful and amusing that, because it diverted me, I cannot deprive the readers of this book of it and so, for the sake of giving them respectable pleasure, I am now happy to undertake the trouble of transcribing it for them.

'At the time of Sigismund I, King of Poland, Jakob Melstinki, governor of the town of Brzeziny [Brezin], in a particularly frivolous frame of mind, appropriated to himself the authority and name of Christ and, as the Twelve, chose the two Zatorskis from Krakow, while the remaining [ten] were thieves like himself. He gave each of these the name of one of the Apostles and called himself Jesus Christ. While they were walking through villages all over the place, they used to work wonders after the fashion of jesters and conjurors. They would secretly suborn other cheats and thieves to play dead, and then resurrect them; they would first put fish in muddy bogs where fish could never be born, and then in the name of Christ catch them with their hands; they would put loaves in ovens when there weren't any there beforehand, and then draw them out in the name of their 'Christ', to the astonishment of the simple-minded common people.

On one occasion, [Melstinki] came with his apostles to the monastery of Czestochowa, famous for its icon of the Blessed Virgin. They stayed there for several days and secretly persuaded one of their number to act as though he were under the influence of an evil spirit, and by these means used to obtain food. He, you see, would walk through the guest-houses and snaffle pieces of meat from the kitchen, and throw them to his companions who would make the sign of the cross over them and eat them. When a large crowd of people had gathered in front of icon of the Blessed Virgin, [Melstinki's] tricksters brought their possessed companion to the altar, wearing two shirts so that he could put the things he needed into the space between. They actually put pebbles inside his undershirt and while they were bringing him to the altar, he broke free in a raging fury from the hands of those who were leading him, rushed up to the altar which was laden with offerings, snatched up some coins, and hid them in the space between his two shirts. At this interruption to the divine office, one monk fled from the altar. The other monks hurried to loosen [the possessed man's] belt. At that point, only the pebbles fell to the floor, while the money remained in his double shirt. The monks thought the money had been changed into pebbles by an artifice of the evil spirit and they tried, by means of exorcisms, to turn [the money] back into its former shape. 82 When the pebbles remained as they were, however, a monk full of indignation threw his holy book on the floor, saying, "We have never had an evil spirit like this one. Away with him to all the devils!"

These tricksters fled to Silesia with the genuine money, and there they turned aside in a certain village to the house of a noble married woman. But because her husband was not there, she was unwilling to give them admittance and they merely asked for a napkin or a piece of cloth so that they could celebrate Mass. The woman offered them a little bundle of cloth and then they said, 'We shall take this with us, and Christ will bless you so that your flax grows more abundantly. Tell us if you have another one'. Since they wanted to take this as well, the woman refused because she was afraid of her husband, but they secretly rolled up a scrap of kindling along with fire into the cloth and gave it back to the woman. Consequently, a chest was set on fire because of the cloth and the house was set alight because of the chest, and when the husband came back his wife said this had happened because she had treated Christ and His Apostles badly.

Her husband, however, incandescent with rage, said, 'This man was an absolutely good-for-nothing thief, not Christ!' So, he and his neighbours went in pursuit of them and caught up with them in one of the villages. Then the pseudo-Christ said to the man who was called Peter, 'My suffering and the cup I am about to drink are approaching'. Peter said, 'I see they are near at hand for me as well, Lord. But [Melstinki] said, 'Peter, I shall be obliged to escape through the window', and Peter said, 'I shall not abandon you as long as I live. Wherever you run away to, I shall follow'. So, he fled through the window and the rest of the 'apostles' also escaped in whatever way they could. The country folk followed them, and felled them with their sticks and clubs, saying, Prophesy to us, Christ and your apostles, in which wood did these sticks grow?' Having been punished by these blows, therefore, they later amended their life, saying, 'It is difficult for us to undergo Christ's Passion and the Apostles' sufferings'. This is what the chronicles of Poland say.

'In front of the Painted Porch [in Athens] I saw with my own two eyes a juggler swallow a cavalry-sword which was sharp at one end and had a dangerous point, and not long afterwards I saw the same man plunge a hunting-spear, lethal end first, right down into his guts; and, do you know, from behind the blade of the spear, where the shaft of the inverted weapon went into the man's throat, there appeared a pretty, effeminate boy who climbed up and did a dance, writhing round [the shaft] in a series of complicated bends and stretches, as though he had not a tendon or a bone in his body, to the astonishment of every one of us who was there'.

Dositheus performed wonders long ago, but his pupil, Simon Magus, surpassed him-I dealt with his marvels earlier-and Glykas writes briefly in Part 2 [of his chronicle] as follows. 'He made statues walk, and when he threw himself into a fire, he was not burned. He would fly into the air, make bread from stones, and flit from one shape to another. Sometimes he would have two faces. He used to change himself into a pillar. He would make closed doors open of their own accord and domestic crockery seem to move of its own accord to perform its duties for humans. [He made] ghosts walk in front of him and said they were the souls of dead people. Once, when the Emperor was asking after him, he was struck down by terror, abandoned his own shape, and fled to another one'. In a later passage, Glykas writes, 'He had a dog chained at the threshold of his house, and this would devour anyone who tried to visit Simon without being invited. The dog told [St] Peter to come in and, in a human voice, announced that Peter had arrived'. You notice the Devil's power yielded to the power of God which was in Peter, and that Cerberus fawned upon [St Peter] whom he was unable to harm.

<div align="center"><b>Julian the Chaldaean Checking the Plague in Rome</b></div>

Both Apuleius and Anastasius tell us that during the reign of Domitian this Julian surpassed Apollonius in this craft and when it came to checking a plague which had suddenly fallen on Rome. (There is a mention of Julian in Arnobius, Book 1, [52].) When two learned men have a rambling conversation while they are putting Vulcan back, Anastasius adds the same thing, and from him Cedrenus [repeats the information] that Manetho was so skilled in working magic that he was always openly contemptuous of Apollonius to his face.

<div align="center"><b>The Innkeeper Wise-Woman's Transformations</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 29-30</div>
Apuleius, himself a magician according to the evidence given by many people, writes about two women who were most deserving of astonishment. First of all he tells us about the landlady of an inn-a 'queen of wise women', to let you know that even in those days some of them were honoured with that title. 89 'A wise-woman', he says, 'has the power of a divinity to bring down the sky and lift up the earth, turn springs into stone and cause mountains to melt away, to raise the spirits of the dead to the surface of the earth and bring the gods down under it, to quench the stars and light up the underworld itself. Because her lover had dishonoured her with another woman, with a single word she turned him into a wild beaver, because when that animal is afraid of being caught, it escapes from those who are chasing it by biting off its genitals, [her idea being] that, because he had had sex with another woman, something similar would happen to him.

Since a neighbouring landlord was in competition with her, she changed him into a frog, and now the old man swims around in a barrel of his own wine and speaks to his former customers in polite croaks while he grovels abjectly in the lees. She changed someone else, an advocate who had spoken against her in court, into ram and now that is how he pleads his cases. This same woman condemned her lover's wife to perpetual pregnancy, (because she had said something satirical at her expense), by closing up the woman's womb and retarding the foetus's growth, and according to everyone's calculations the poor woman has now been distended for eight years, as though she were going to give birth to an elephant.90

<div align="center"><b>Pamphile the Magician's Powers</b></div>

Later on, he says of Pamphile, 'She is believed to be a magician [maga] with a very great reputation, and to be mistress of every kind of graveyard incantation. She knows how to plunge the entire light of the starry universe into the depths of the underworld and turn it into its ancient chaos, [simply] by breathing on twigs or pebbles or worthless things of that kind. As soon as she catches sight of a good looking young man, she is captivated by his beauty and immediately has no eyes or thoughts for anyone else. She instantly turns those who are of low rank and not complaisant enough into rocks and cattle and any other kind of creature. Others, however, she destroys completely.⁹¹

<div align="center"><b>Empedocles the Wind-Stopper</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 30-30</div>
According to [Diogenes] Laertius, Empedocles boasted considerably in the following vein:

'You will obtain the drugs with which to drive away illnesses and lighten old age,

And I am communicating them to you alone. By means of your rituals you will restrain the violence of winds Which suddenly spring up and devastate the fields with their raging blasts.

If you wish, you will soon rouse sluggish streams [to run] high And bring back fine weather from the midst of a storm. You will bring health-giving showers in the midst of summer, And the winds which blow over everything when the harvest is dry, And you will recall a dead person from the black underworld.

He also adds, from the histories of Timaeus, that whenever the etesian winds were blowing so strongly that they flattened the crops, Empedocles ordered that donkeys be flayed and after [their skins] had been turned into bags, he said they were to be moved to hills and the tops of mountains to collect the breezes.

Once the winds had stopped because of this, he was known as the xwhuoavéMas [wind-stopper].

<div align="center"><b>Circe's Love for Picus and Her Magical Transformations</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 30-31</div>
In his Metamorphoses, after Ovid has told the story of Ulysses's companions being turned into pigs, he expatiates on Circe's love and hatred for King Picus, among other things, and about Camens, or Canens, Picus's wife.

'She was remarkable for her beauty, but even more remarkable for the way she sang, Which is why she was called "Canens". She would make woods and rocks move, Soothe wild creatures, and interrupt the flow of long rivers With her voice and hold back roaming birds [from flying away]'.

A little later, he tells us about Circe herself, who had caught sight of Picus and had fallen violently in love with him. She says,

'But you will not escape, [even if] the wind is allowed to carry you away, If I know myself, if the power of my herbs has not vanished entirely, And my magical chants do not fail me'. She finished speaking and fashioned the likeness of a non-existent boar without a body, And told it to run across in front of the King's eyes And seem to go into a grove where the trees were thick.

While Picus came along with his horse in pursuit of the non-existent boar, she overtook him and, with words and a wicked spell, lured him into an act of passion.

'She took to prayer and spoke words of supplication, And entreated unknown gods with an unknown incantation, One with which she was also accustomed to disfigure the face of the snowwhite moon And affix to its ancient head clouds which suck up moisture. Then, too, by chanting an incantation she made the sky grow dense, And the earth breathed forth mists', etc.

But when the man chastely rejected the adulterous woman, she became mad with rage.

'Then she turned twice to the west and twice to the east. She touched the young man three times with her wand, and three times spoke her incantations'.

He was changed into a bird and saw feathers on his body. Finally, when his servants used threats to demand their king [be released] from the power of her harmful magic, She inflicted harm upon them by sprinkling them with poisonous slime and juices, And summoned Night and the gods of night from Erebus and Chaos, And prayed to Hecate with drawn-out wailing cries. The woods-marvellous to relate-leaped up from their place, The ground groaned, the neighbouring trees turned pale, She sprinkled the animals' fodder and made it wet with drops of blood. It seemed as though the stones were producing hoarse bellowings, That dogs were barking, that the earth was squalid with black snakes, And the thin souls of the silent [dead] were flitting about. These evil portents filled the astonished crowd with panic. She touched the amazed faces of the panic-stricken with her magically poisonous wand, And at its touch the monstrous appearances of various wild beasts Fell upon the young men. No one retained his own shape'.

Of Medea he says in his foolish way, 'She strives to draw down the unwilling moon from its course And to hide the horses of the sun in darkness. She curbs waters and makes winding streams stand still. She moves woods and living rocks from their place. She wanders among [newly-dug] graves, noticeable because of her loose hair, And collects particular bones from pyres which are still hot. She curses people who are not there, fashions images out of wax, And drives thin needles into their wretched liver', [Heroides 6.85-92].

She has split open the ground with an incantation, drawn the spirits of the dead from their graves, And called down bones form a pyre which was still hot. Now she rouses the companies of the underworld with her magical hissing, Now she sprinkles them with milk and sends them back again. When she pleases, she drives clouds from a gloomy sky. When she pleases, she calls up snows from the summer sky. She is said to be in possession of Medea's herbs And to be the only one who has tamed Hecate's dogs. She has composed for me incantations with which you could deceive [people]. Intone them three times and spit when you have finished chanting. [Your husband] will not be able to believe anyone who [tells him] about us, Not even himself if he were to see us [together] on a soft bed.

You must, however, have nothing to do with other men, because he will see everything else. It is only in my case he will see nothing at all. What shall I believe? This woman has certainly said She can destroy my loves with her incantations or herbs', [Elegies 1.2.4363].

'Whatever you see in the world obeys me. The earth, which abounds with flowers, Becomes listless when I wish it, and withers when its juices have dried up. It pours forth its riches when I wish it, and a crag with its bristling rocks Hurl out their native waters. The sea submits motionless Waves to me, and the west winds place their silent blasts At my feet. Rivers obey me. So do Hyrcanean tigresses, and snakes I have commanded to stand still. Why am I telling you about quite trivial things? The image of the moon comes down, Drawn by my incantations, and Phoebus in alarm is compelled To turn round his frenzied horses, once I have rolled back the vault [of the sky]. So great is the power of words. The fiery passion of bulls dies down, xtinguished by a virgin's rites, and Circe, Phoebus's daughter, too, Has changed Ulysses's companions with her magical incantations,' [Satyricon 134].

Will you come running back to me; and your right mind Will return, but not because it has been summoned by Marsian incantations. I shall prepare something stronger, since you disdain me. I shall pour you a stronger dose. And the sky will sink below the sea With the earth stretched out [over both] Before you fail to burn with love for me, Like pitch with its black fires'.

And presently [she says]:

'I can make waxen images move, As you know yourself, thanks to your curiosity; And with my incantations I can tear down the moon from the sky.

I can rouse the dead after they have been cremated, And make potions which excite desire.

<div align="center"><b>The Powers of the Thessalian Women and Erichtho</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 32-33</div>
More accurately than anyone else although, because of his overblown diction and lofty arrogance, somewhat obscurely, Marcus Lucan [says] of Erichtho:

'By means of Thessalian women's incantation love, which has not been prevailed on by the Fates, Has flooded into hearts hardened [against it], And grace old men have burned with illicit flames. Nor is it only their noxious Potions, or the pledges of future love for their young, which they remove, Swollen with juice, from [a foal's] forehead, which have an effect.⁹⁷ Even when it has not been defiled by the bloody matter of the poison someone has drunk, Once the mind has been enchanted, it perishes. Those whom the harmony of married sex And the power of a seductive shape does not bind together, [These women have influenced by means of the magic whirling of a twisted thread.⁹⁸ Nature's changes have ceased. Drawn out by a long night, Daylight sticks fast. The upper air has not obeyed the law. The headlong sky has become sluggish because it has listened to their incantation, And while he bears down on the heavens which are driven forward on their swift axles, Jupiter is amazed they are not loving. Now [the women fill everything With rain, and draw clouds in front of hot Phoebus, And the sky thunders without Jupiter's knowledge. With these same incantations
[The women], their hair flowing loose, have driven far away The damp mists and rainclouds. Since the winds are abating, The sea swells high. Forbidden once again to experience storms, It is silent while the south wind is throwing it into confusion, and the sails which carry the ship, Have swollen against the wind. A torrent has hung from a steep cliff, Stuck fast, and a deep-flowing stream has run In a quite different direction. Summer has not brought a rise in the [waters of the Nile; The Meander sends its waters in a straight line, and the Arar Has dashed headlong upon the sluggish Rhône. Mountains have lowered their summit and loosened their ridges. Olympus Has looked up at the clouds; and when winter was making things stiff [with ice], Even though the sun had not been shining, the snows in Scythia have melted away.

The Thessalian women's incantation has driven back from the shore they were defending The sea-goddess Tethys who was urged forward by the moon. The earth, too, has violently shaken the axes of her steady weight And, because of the exertion as she bends towards the centre of her sphere, has tottered. The cargo of such a great mass, struck by the incantation, Has fallen back and given a sight of the sky gliding round it. Every living creature with the power to kill, and which was born to do harm, Also dreads the Thessalian women and provides their practices with [the means of death. Greedy tigresses and the noble anger of lions Fawn upon these women. The snake unfolds his icy coils for them And stretches himself out upon the ploughed and frosty ground. Knotted vipers burst open their body and unite again, And a snake drops dead, breathed on by human poison,' [Pharsalia 6.452-491].

A few verses later, [he says]: 'By those women the stars were first Brought down from the sky as it rushed headlong, and the cloudless moon, Besieged by the dreadful poisons of their incantations, Looked pale and burned with dark light from the earth, Just as if the earth were stopping her brother's reflection, And inserting its shadows in the way of the flames from heaven. Pressed down [under the weight of the incantation, she suffers these great pains Until, having come nearer [the earth], she deposits foam on the herbs beneath her', [Pharsalia 6. 499-506].

No less learnedly, Lucan's uncle, famous for comedy and tragedy in what remains of [ancient] drama in Latin, my favourite, Seneca.

'Now, summoned by my rites, come, planet of the nights, Assume your most evil aspects, threatening in every one of your faces. For you, after the custom of my tribe, I have set free my hair from its bonds And have wandered your secret groves with naked feet. I have summoned water from clouds which have no rain, And driven the seas down to their depths; and Ocean Has sent his heavy waves further inland, since his tides have been overwhelmed. Because the law of the upper air has been thrown into confusion, The world has seen the sun and moon side by side and, 0 Bears, You have touched the sea which is forbidden to you. I have changed the sequence of the seasons. The summer earth has shuddered at my incantation And Ceres, under this compulsion, has seen harvest in winter. The Phasis has returned its violent streams to their source And the Ister, divided between so many mouths, has squeezed together Its savage waves and is sluggish on all its banks. The surge has resounded, the maddened sea thundered, Yet the wind is silent. The shelter of the ancient grove Has lost its shadows at the command of my incantation. Phoebus has abandoned the day and has come to rest in mid-sky; And the Hyades, moved by my incantations, are ready to fall', [Medea 750769].

I have stirred up a strait, Even though there was no wind, and I have calmed the wild sea; And the dry earth has opened up with fresh streams of water. Rocks have begun to move. I have burst open the doors Of the underworld and [scattered] its ghosts, and at my prayer of command The spirits of the dead talk, and the dog of the underworld has spoken. The sea, the land, the sky, and the underworld are my servants. The middle of the night has seen the sun, and day [has seen] night, And at my incantations, nothing keeps its laws', [Hercules Oetaeus 452463].

The juices which flow From trees and the power of deadly [herbs] are not unknown to meWhatever flourishes on the Caucasus, rich with lethal plants, and blooms on the crags of Scythia[Herbs] which savage Medea and cunning Circe gathered. I have quite often propitiated the frightening spirits of the dead, and Hecate, With rituals done at night, and by means of my incantations Dragged corpses back to life after they have been buried. I have also destroyed many people with my chanting, Even though the Parcae were still spinning their threads. I have compelled oak-trees to wander about and a lightning-bolt to halt in its tracks.

I have bent rivers and turned them round to flow backwards And return to their sources. So that you may not think That perhaps I have told you lies, see how your own house has changed'. She finished speaking. The snow-white pillars, to his amazement, began To change themselves into gold, and the roof-beams suddenly Started to gleam with precious metal, [Against Rufinus 1.145-163].

[The ancient writers] confirm this, because they tell us that a flame comes out of [a rock] at the waters of Scantia. 'It is weak when it comes out and cannot last long in a different material.

The ends of its fingers burned with a sulphurous, violet-coloured flame so that witches [striges] could pour all their wicked venom upon someone who was sleeping and complete what they had decided to do. When at length the flame was put out, the fingers were as whole and uninjured as if they had not been a source of light earlier.

I shall be content with a single example in which the merit of religious or blind obedience, along with faith, also shines forth. [Bernardino] Scardeone writes as follows. 'It happened once, perhaps by chance, that an Augustinian prior there was invited to lunch and sat down with these people', (the Jesuit followers of the Blessed [Giovanni] Colombini). 'After the food and drink had been removed and the spectators had withdrawn, and permission to speak had been given, he started to discourse, interminably and arrogantly, about the merits of the way Dominicans made their vows, tacitly reproving [the Jesuates] because, although they were counted as monks, they would not publicly and openly acknowledge their profession of the three vows along with all other monks in accordance with the usual form. To this the superior of the Jesuits, an uneducated individual, to be sure, but a clever man and one who was dear to God, craftily replied, "Father", (he said), "since we happen to be having conversation along these lines, do you want one of our brothers, who has offered himself to God in a straightforward way, or that companion of yours who has made his three vows in public, to show us who is the more genuinely obedient to his superior?" [The prior], not realising [what he was doing], willingly agreed. Then the Jesuit turned straight away to our Brother Marcus who happened to be serving those seated at table and said, "Brother Marcus, these friends of ours are cold.

By virtue of holy obedience, go quickly to the kitchen and bring them burning coals in your bare hands, so that they can warm up straight away". [Marcus] did not hesitate, (because he was quick to do as he was told), and believing there would be nothing he could not do if commanded under the rule of obedience, without any hesitation quickly carried from the kitchen to the table as many burning coals as he could in his cupped hands without any damage or harm to himself, and offered them to each man so that he could relieve his cold. Then, on the order of his superior, to everyone’s astonishment he took them back again whence he had brought them. The Dominican [i.e. Augustinian] prior I mentioned, immeasurably taken aback by this, looked at his companion as if he were about to tell him to do the same at once, but he, realising the situation, came to the conclusion he should not hesitate and immediately burst out as follows. "Reverend Father, for goodness’ sake don’t order me to tempt God. If you want, I shall bring fire in a sherd as I usually do, but not in my hands". But they, filled with astonishment on account of such a great miracle, were silent and stunned on the one hand, and on the other, pleased by their comrade’s unexpected reply, looked at each other and smiled.

It no more agrees with reason than the more recent silly notion of a certain nation in our time, which thinks that the moon was swallowed by an ass because a herd of animals in Arcadia drank from a river in which, as does happen, the face of the moon was shining while [the herd] was drinking, and when [the animals] moved away the moon could not be seen because it was suddenly hidden by a cloud. Consequently, the people threw the unfortunate rider of Silenus into prison, fell on a colt, cut open its belly, and disembowelled it in a most savage fashion in order to restore the moon to the world.

It is incredible that at Cleonae there were people publicly appointed to be халаÇopuráxas [hail-guards] to watch out for an approaching hail-storm. When these people had given the signal that such a hail-storm was near at hand, what do you think happened then? That people ran off to get their raincoats or get under cover? Not a bit of it! Each person would offer a sacrifice for his own benefit-one a lamb, another a chicken, and straight away, after they had tasted some of the blood, those clouds would start to veer off in another direction. Does this make you smile? Listen to something which will make you smile even more. If someone did not have a lamb or a chicken, he would lay hands on himself-but not to the extent of doing himself serious hurt, and I should not like to make you think that clouds are greedy or cruel. He would prick his finger with a really sharp pen and make his sacrifice with this blood. The hail would turn away from this man's little piece of ground just as much as it would [from the land] of someone who had persuaded it to do so by sacrificing bigger victims.

The Indians in Cianita procure rain by means of a ridiculous ceremony which is described in letters dated 1590 and 1591 from my Jesuit brethren in Peru. Gaspare Spitilli gives the following extract. 'When they are in need of rain, one of their magicians cries out in a loud, impassioned voice, speaking faster and faster, [saying] that they must all go to the mountain, and that when they get there everyone must abstain from food according to custom. (This "fast" of theirs, however, refers merely to salt, pepper, and cooked food.) When they have done this, they call earnestly upon the stars at the tops of their voices and pray for water. Then they return to their lands and pagan stronghold, taking a certain potion, which they drink when a young girl of a noble family offers it [to them]. It causes them to lose their senses and their reason, with the result that they look as though they are dead. After they have recovered, however, they mingle honey with water and maize and sprinkle the mixture in the direction of the clouds. Next day they place a well-born old man, or at any rate one of good reputation who is held in honour, on a couch and light a slow fire under it. When he starts to sweat, the magician catches the sweat in a jar, mixes it with goose-blood and the water from a crushed root, and again throws this liquid into the air as if to soak the clouds, asking, by the sweat, the blood, and the water, that the water they desire be bestowed upon them; and if by chance it rains on the day they carry out their superstitious ceremonies, they give thanks to the stars and shower the magician with many gifts'.

'I certainly remember this, which was testified and maintained by the free and voluntary assertion of two hundred people, more or less, whom I, in my capacity as a local magistrate, sentenced to be burned to atone for the crime of fortune-telling [sortilegii]. [They said] that it was their habit to meet on specific days and assemble on the bank of a fen or brook, especially if there was one which would be well hidden from the eyes of passers-by. There, with a wand they had been given by an evil spirit, they would keep on beating the water until they raised thick clouds of vapour and steam by which they were all borne aloft together. Then [they used] whatever they had stirred up in this fashion to clothe themselves in thick, dark clouds, and after they had enveloped themselves and their evil spirits in them, they would drive and thrust them wherever they wanted and at last shake out a lot of rain and hail on to the lands below. In this case I don't think there is any deception involved other than their thinking they are raising those vapours by thrashing [the water]. The evil spirit is doing it and carries the witches [striges] aloft through the air in those clouds and makes sure they do not suffocate. If those women are being carried along by the clouds, can it be denied that they could fall to earth from the clouds if the evil spirit abandons them? But more of this later. Rémy adds that before they beat the water like this, they would sometimes throw into it an earthenware jar in which the evil spirit had enclosed something secret, or even stones the same size they wanted the hail to be when it fell. Sometimes [they had] candles which they took down to the fen and held downwards while alight until drops [of wax] falling into it had sufficiently tainted the fen. In addition to this, they would sprinkle poisoned dust into the water. They would usually use black wands they had been given by an evil spirit to thrash the water and would beat the water with them without any kind of pause, at the same time repeating the words of dreadful imprecations. Certain women have also confessed that, with the help of an evil spirit, male and female witches drive big-mouthed jars through the clouds as far as a place they have in mind. [The jars] then hang upside down over it, are burst open with rocks and flames and, in a swift attack, destroy and pound to pieces anything in their path.

<div align="center"><b>Peasant's Daughter Summons Rain in the Garden</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 44-45</div>
Rémy gives many examples in chapters 25 and 29 of the same Book. Let me add two, one pleasantly amusing, the other ghastly. In the jurisdiction of Trier there was a peasant who, along with his eight-year old daughter, was planting cabbages in his garden. He happened to praise the little girl because she was carrying out this task well and she, a chatterbox because of her sex and age, said she knew how to do other, much more remarkable things. Her father asked her what she meant and she said, 'Stand aside a little and I shall make it rain all of a sudden on any part of the garden you like'. He was surprised and said, 'All right, I'll stand aside'. So he did so and the little girl dug a trench, poured water into it from her 'feet'-I'm using the Hebrew euphemism-stirred the water with a stick, muttered something or other under her breath, and lo and behold, suddenly rain [fell] from the clouds on to the designated spot. Her father was astounded. 'Who taught you this?' he asked. 'Mummy', she replied, 'and she's very good at this and other things like it, too'. After a few days the farmer, stirred by zeal, pretended that he, his wife, and his daughter had been invited to a wedding. Hastily they dressed up for the wedding and he put them into a wagon, drove them to the nearby town, and handed them over to a judge to pay the penalty for their crime of harmful magic [maleficium]. (I was told this story by men whom I find entirely worthy of being believed).

<div align="center"><b>Priests Summon Rain During Siege of Marcos</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 44-45</div>
The following exemplary story was recorded by [Giovanni] Gioviano Pontano. Ferdinand, King of Naples, was closely besieging the town of Marcos which lay near a fortress situated on Monte Dracone at the end of the Massican Hills, because it favoured the Angers party. A failure of its water-supply had almost forced it to surrender when a number of ungodly priests ventured to use magical practices to draw down rain. They were drawn from townspeople and the besieged who, under darkness of night, deceived the castle-guards and stealthily made their way along very uneven rocks to the shore, hauling with them an image of Christ nailed to the cross. First of all, they loaded it with abuse and frightful incantation, then they cursed it, plunged it into the sea, and invoked a storm from the sky upon the sea and the land. At the same time a number of priests, more villainous than anyone else, (seeing that they were busying themselves in carrying out unholy military manoeuvres to their satisfaction,) performed an abominable ritual whereby, it was said, they thought they could draw down the rain they needed. They stood an ass in front of the door of a church, chanted a deadly incantation, and then thrust a consecrated Host into the roof of [the animal's] mouth. They repeatedly addressed the ass in loud voices with deadly chants and then buried it alive on that spot in front of the church door. Scarcely had they completed the ritual than the air started to cloud over, winds began to stir up the sea, and darkness to pour over the brightness of midday. At one point the sky would flash with bolts of lightning, at another the light would be snatched away, and the sky and land would quake beneath the thunder. Trees ripped up by the winds were flying [through the air], and rocks split open by lightning were filling the air with their fragments. So much rain burst out of the clouds, and so heavy was the downpour, that not only were the cisterns incapable of collecting the water, but they poured out stones and rocks which had been burned and made thirsty by the sun, and torrents [of water] which spread out in every direction. Thus, the King, who had relied on taking the town by making it thirsty, was frustrated of his hope and returned to his former camp in Savo'.

<div align="center"><b>Magician Invokes Lightning with Black Chicken Sacrifice</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 45-46</div>
Andrea Cesalpino, an Aristotelian, writes as follows in chapter 11 of his Inquiry into Evil Spirits. 'We have come across men who would stir up not only hailstorms, but lightning, too, but used to say they could not harm anyone they wanted, only those whom God had abandoned'-that is, in my opinion, who had fallen from God's grace through mortal sin. 'One of these men used to do this. He would invoke the prince of evil spirits in open fields and beg him to send one of his servants to strike with lightning someone he [the magician] had chosen. Later he would sacrifice a black chicken to him at a crossroad and throw it into the air, and once the evil spirit had received it, the magician would stir up a very violent hurricane, accompanied by lightning. This, however, rarely fell on the individual he had chosen'.

while Maruthes, the Bishop of Mesopotamia, was doing his official duties at the court of Yazdegerd, King of Persia, and Yazdegerd was showing the bishop favour because of his religious devotion, the Magi, fearing for their religion in case the King was going to convert, raised an intolerable stench and made up a false accusation that his Christian friends were responsible for it.

They can make rivers temporarily cease to flow, dry up the channels of springs but still allow water to continue [bubbling up], wash away rocks and stones with springs they produce from the earth, and interrupt streams and drive them back to their source with the result that they seem to be flowing backwards-something Pliny says happened in his day.

In the land of Africa, there are certain groups of people who cast a spell \[effascinatium\] with their voice and what they say. If these people happen to bestow somewhat fulsome praise on beautiful trees, rather extensive cornfields, rather delightful children, very fine horses, or well-fed flocks in excellent condition, suddenly all these things die, punished for no reason other than this.

<div align="center"><b>Trier Wise-Woman's Milk Theft</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 47-47</div>
A few years ago, while I was staying in Mainz, a very notorious wise-woman \[saga\] was put to death in Trier. She had driven a stopcock in the wall of her house and would draw off all the milk from other people's cows-that is to say, an evil spirit would milk the cows and remove the milk very quickly by this means.

<div align="center"><b>Rémy's Insect and Animal Plagues</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 47-48</div>
According to Rémy, they have a habit of sprinkling a tiny bit of dust an evil spirit has given them, and this causes canker-worms, winged and wingless locusts, slugs, caterpillars, and this kind of noxious bane of fields and gardens, to make an immediate appearance. They lay waste to everything, pillage the standing corn, garden-vegetables, fruit, and sometimes the grass itself; and when they have done this, they sometimes raise a large number of mice which bury themselves in the earth straight away and eat the shoots and all the roots. Sometimes they attack draught-animals with a gadfly which, in the end, kills them cruelly with repeated stings. Sometimes they strike a particular herb against a tree and bring wolves out of what appears to be a hollow in the tree to the place where they want them to attack a sheepfold and its flock, and \[the wolves\] do not go away until they have caused great carnage. Rémy records the judicial confessions of all these people in Book 1, chapters 21 and 24, and thinks that the evil spirit does not produce these afflictions afresh for the occasion, but that he gathers things quickly from all over the place into a single spot. There is certainly no doubt at all that \[an evil spirit\] can do this.  
It seems likely that, because they harm and lie in ambush for precisely the particular flock and sheepfold to which they have been directed and which the person directing them wants them \[to attack\], those wolves are evil spirits who do this kind of damage under the guise of wolves. We may think that nothing stops an evil spirit from producing locusts and every other insect from material which has been placed here and there, by applying active things to passive, since they can be born from rottenness, although he does this at the time he needs and needs only a very short time \[to do it\].

<div align="center"><b>Mainz Evil Spirit Slanderer</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 48-48</div>
Such was the evil spirit of Mainz, an extraordinary slanderer, about whom \[Conrad\] Lycosthenes writes in his Extraordinary Events under the year 858, and another evil spirit who acknowledged that a monk in Santarém in Portugal was a saint.

<div align="center"><b>St Silvanus and St Kunegunda Slander</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 48-48</div>
There is also the well-known story about a large number of evil spirits who were celebrating a feast at night and, even though they were deceiving demons, lied that they had come from a neighbouring lodging-house. St Germanus disclosed the deception.  
God may be more ready to permit them to take on the appearances of magicians and of those who have sometimes been ensnared by this crime, but it should not be denied that an evil spirit can fully adopt the appearances of innocent people if God allows \[him to do so\], although when and if He does allow it, He soon either uncovers the deception, as I have said, or allows it either \[as a contribution\] towards the remission of other sins \[the innocents have committed\], or for their greater merit and glory in enduring \[the experience\]. (See Bartolomeo della Spina, Investigation into Night-Flying Witches, chapter 14 and \[Three\] Defences \[against Giovanni Ponzinibio\], Book 3, chapter 3). ... something I read in connection with St Silvanus, Bishop of Nazareth, and St Kunegunda, (this I read in \[Albert\] Kranz), who was slandered by an evil spirit with behaving licentiously.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 48-48</div>
I find that Mammon, an evil spirit who laid siege to the virgin St Eustochia of Padua, did this. God allowed her to be possessed this way for the whole of her life so that she could gain greater grace and glory, and when she was dead the name \'Jesus\' was found written in indelible writing on her little body. (Read Bernardino Scardoneo, The Antiquities of Padua, Book 2, class 6, folio 121).

\[Magicians\] can likewise harm a reputation by revealing hidden sins, as demoniacs usually do, or by making a false accusation, as someone did in Germany during the reign of Emperor Louis II, (a story told by Sigebert \[of Gembloux\] and Vincent de Beauvais); and another evil spirit made a false accusation against \[St\] Dorotheus in relation to the same crime, as \[Simeon\] Metaphrastes tells us in \[Laurent\] Sauer, \'January\'

<div align="center"><b>Magician's Failed Prison Escape for Duke Frederick</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 48-49</div>
\[Johannes\] Trithemius tells a story about Leopold, Duke of Austria, which is worth repeating. \'In 1533 Frederick, Duke of Austria, who had been elected Emperor instead of Ludwig of Bavaria, was beaten in a great battle between Ettingen and Moludorfum and handed over to Ludwig who sent him to a wellfortified tower to be kept under guard. Meanwhile, in Austria, a magician \[magus\] promised \[Frederick's\] brother Leopold that, if he were paid well, he would bring Frederick safely \[out of the tower\] within one hour by means of magic. The Duke made generous promises, and so an evil spirit was commissioned and flew to Bavaria. He assumed the appearance of a foreigner and came to the prison.  
\'If you want to be set free from captivity\', he said, \'mount this horse and I'll take you safe and sound to your brother Leopold in Austria\'.  
\'Who are you?\' asked the Duke.  
\'Don't ask me who I am\', replied the evil spirit, \'because that is beside the point. Just mount the horse I am showing you\'.  
At this point the Duke, who was in other circumstances a very courageous man, was seized with dread and protected himself with the sign of the cross. The spirit \[spiritus\], along with his black horse, disappeared and returned emptyhanded to the \[magician\] who had sent him. The magician loudly rebuked him for not bringing back the prisoner, and the spirit gave him an account of what had happened.

<div align="center"><b>Tartars' Magical Smoke Victory Over Poles</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 50-50</div>
\[Martin\] Cromer says this about a memorable victory of the Tartars over the Poles. \'In 1240AD the Poles were fighting with the Tartars and were beginning to drive them forcibly in the direction of Legnica and press hard on the fugitives. In the Tartars' rear-guard there was, among other banners, a prominent flag with the letter X on its leading side. On the pointed end \[of its pole\], however, was the dreadful black figure of a bearded head. When the flag-bearer shook this flag with a degree of force, the head would breathe out smoke and a very dense, most disgusting vapour. This vapour would not only stop the Poles from seeing the barbarians but would also kill them with its utterly loathsome smell. The Tartars had made this happen by means of certain incantations which they use in their soothsayings and the rest of their divinations, (just as they do on other occasions, and especially in war), and they are also accustomed to guess the course of future events from human entrails. When the barbarians sensed that the Poles were in disarray, they encouraged each other, made an assault on \[the enemy\], threw their ranks into confusion, and caused great slaughter. The number of Christians killed in this battle was so great that the single ears the Tartars cut off. filled nine enormous sacks.\'

<div align="center"><b>Noema's Magical Aid to Compus</b></div>

The Chinese worship Noema, a virgin, for her sanctity. \[Juan\] González de Mendoza writes about her in Book 2, chapter 2 of his history of China. \[He says\] she had acquired the worship because of her practice of magic. When, by order of the King, a war-leader called Compus was leading his fleet towards an island, he could not pull up anchor, however hard he tried, so that he could sail away. At last, he noticed Noema sitting, quite unexpectedly, on his ship's figurehead. He approached her, full of reverence, and begged her for help and advice. She replied that unless she guided them, they would not be victorious over the Chinese, and so he set sail with her and hemmed in the enemy who were putting their trust in rather powerful conjuring-tricks. They poured oil on the sea and wrapped everything around in pretended flames, as though to destroy the fleet with fire. Noema put them out and dispelled similar stunts by the enemy with her more efficacious magic, the result being that when they saw that their attempts were unsuccessful, they acknowledged they were beaten and surrendered to Compus. (Mendoza adds several other things, too.)

Suidas also testifies that a man from Miletus was taking part in a wrestling match with a man from Ephesus during the Olympics and was unable to win his bout because the Ephesian had \'Ephesian marks\' \[attached\] to his ankle, and it was noticed that as soon as these were removed by the referees the Ephesian, who had already exhausted thirty \[competitors\], was defeated.

<div align="center"><b>Chrysame's Poisoned Victory</b></div>

Next \[example\]: among the other causes of the great massacre of Flemings by the French in 1302, \[Jacob de\] Meyer in Book 10 of his chronicles records that the commander of the Flemish army, Willem van Gulik, personally employed diviners and necromancers \[sortilegos et necromanticos\], and conjured and consulted evil spirits. (\[Robert\] Gaguin and other French historians ascribe the same reason for the defeat and captivity of Ferdinand of Portugal, the Count of Flanders through his wife-\[namely\] the witchcraft \[sortilegium\] of his mother. The Flemings are silent on the subject). In connection with the year 1304, Jacob de Meyer also says this of the Willem I mentioned. \'Gossip has it that he was deceived by a necromancer from whom he had learned a \[magical\] technique which he promised would render him invisible whenever he wanted during danger, however great \[the danger might be\]. But the spell did him no good at all when it came to saving his life\'.

The people of Pergamum once tried to free themselves from a siege by using magic, but their attempt came to nothing and their effort was wasted, as Paul the Deacon tells us in Book 20 of his history of Rome;

<div align="center"><b>Saracens' Capture of Pergamum</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 51-51</div>
and during the reign of Leo the Isaurian, Masalmas \[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik\], the leader of the Saracens, seized Pergamum without any difficulty even though the citizens, who were relying on a certain magician, had made an appalling sacrifice to the Devil by cutting open a pregnant woman, removing the child alive, and boiling it in a cooking-pot while all the soldiers polluted the right-hand sleeve \[of their tunics\] with this wicked sacrifice. (For which, see Theophanes.)

<div align="center"><b>Bretislav's Battle and Stepmother's Curse</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 51-52</div>
I remember another noteworthy example of a \[magical\] stunt in connection with this topic, too. Bretislav, Duke of the Luczani-this is what Aeneas Silvius says-\'the founder of Bratislava, had started a war with his own nephew, Gremozislaus, Duke of Bohemia. The story is that when her stepson was about to go to war, there was a woman there who predicted that Bretislav would fall in battle and that the greater part of the populace would die with him, but that the young man \[her stepson\] could escape if he did as she told him. The youth replied that he would carry out her instructions, and so she told him he was to kill the first man he met, cut off both his ears, and stow them away in his wallet. Then he was to draw a cross on the ground with his sword between his horse's front legs, kiss it, and make a speedy retreat. Battle was joined on a plain called Thuscus, and Bretislav was killed. The young man who had done as his stepmother had told him escaped safely home, but he found that his wife, whom he loved dearly, had been killed. Her ears were missing and her breast had been pierced through. Aghast and unhappy, he realised that the ears of the enemy, which he had cut off, were those of his wife\'.

So, Pope Innocent acted no less judiciously than he did religiously when he took pains to expel from Rome magicians who had been invited there by pagans from Tuscany on the promise that they would free the city from a siege by Alaric, the same way they boasted they had rescued the town of Larina.

<div align="center"><b>Count of Allobroges Executes Magician</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 52-52</div>
Not unlike this was the good sense, (but more severe judicial punishment), in the case of the Count of the Allobroges. This man was a follower of the Duke of Anjou and had charge of the Castel dell'Ovo, a heavily fortified \[castle\] in Naples, washed on all sides by the sea. The Duke sent for him because he wanted his advice. Should a certain person's offer be accepted or not? The \'certain person\' was a magician who was boasting that he had surrendered this very fortress into the hands of Charles the Peacemaker who had withdrawn into it at the time, and that he was prepared to hand it over to the Angevins by using the same wily trick. He would create a thick cloud, \[he said\], build a bridge by using conjuring-tricks, and immediately extend it to the top of the fortress's walls; and once the defenders had been forced by fear to surrender, the soldiers who were going to come over the bridge would be so much on their guard that they would not be able to make any sign of the cross with their hand, their arms, their legs, or their weapons, and at that moment the bridge would be dispersed like smoke, and those who were crossing over it would die. The Count took note of this and argued that the Duke should send for the magician so that he could give him \[the Count\] more information about the whole business. The wretched man came and repeated his promise to the Count. The Count retorted that he would never commission him to convince such hard-working soldiers and experienced war-leaders that Charles the Peacemaker could not be vanquished without \[recourse to\] forbidden practices and such disgraceful behaviour. He then ordered that the magician be handed over to the public executioner and be beheaded. (These events took place in 1383.)

\[Nicholas\] Rémy confirms this in Book 1, chapter 4 of his Worship of Evil Spirits, with many examples from his personal experience \[as a judge\]. He says, \'In Dieuze on 30th September 1586, Sennel from Armentières received money-so she imagined-from an evil spirit and, in transports of delight, went home quickly to count it, but when she shook out her purse, she found nothing except bits of tile and pieces of charcoal. In Dieuze on 4th November 1586, Catharine from Metz found pig shit. Claudia Morèle in Serre, on 3rd December 1586: Benoît Drigie in Haraucourt, on 15th December 1585: Dominique Pétrone in Pagnysur-Moselle, on 20th October 1586, and very many others \[found\] tree leaves. In Masevaux, on 5th June, 1585, Jeanne le Ban found a gold coin wrapped in paper on the road, just as an evil spirit had predicted she would, and when she eagerly showed it to her husband she noticed, (not without embarrassment), that she had stumbled across a dark red pebble and not a gold coin after all; and what is more, at the very first touch it began to break up into little pieces. Catharina Ruffa from the Vallée de la Moselle, on 28th July 1586, was the only one to acknowledge she had once received three coins without being deceived by the \[evil spirit\]\'.

Rumour has it that when the magicians Faustus and Agrippa were on a journey, \[once they arrived at\] their lodging-houses they were in the habit of counting out coins which were real to look at, but after only one or two days those who had received them would find they were bits of horn or absolutely worthless scraps of rag.

<div align="center"><b>Basel Tailor's Snake-Woman Treasure Encounter</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 54-55</div>
\'In about 1520 in Basel, a simple-minded tailor with a stammer entered, (exactly how is not clear), the tunnel by which one can get into Augusta Raurica and, having gone further than anyone else had managed, he brought back a report of a number of extraordinary things he had seen. He lit a consecrated candle and went down into the tunnel. First, (he used to say), he had gone through an iron gate. Then he came out of one vault into another, and then into gardens which were in full, very beautiful bloom. In the middle he observed a hall, very richly decorated, and a young woman, very beautiful down to her private parts. Her head was circled with a golden crown, her hair was loose, and her lower half ended in \[the form of a frightening snake. She took him by the hand and led him to an iron chest. Two black hounds were lying on it and when they approached, \[the dogs\] set up a dreadful barking, but the young woman, with a menacing air, restrained them. Then she removed a bunch of keys she was in the habit of wearing tied round her neck, opened the chest, and brought out all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze coins, and he used to tell people that, as a result of the young woman's generosity, he had brought back not a few of these \[coins\] out of the tunnel itself.  
He added that the young woman told him more than once, with dreadful imprecations, that when she was born, she was already cursed by her royal descent, and had been changed into the kind of monster \[he saw before him\], and that she had no good reason to think she would recover her wholesomeness. But if she were kissed three times by a young man of undiminished propriety, her original form would be restored to her and the whole treasure which was lying hidden in that spot would be made over to her liberator as a dowry. He claimed he had indeed kissed the young woman twice, \[but\] that twice he observed her making such dreadful gestures in anticipation of her liberation that he was afraid she would tear him to pieces while he was still alive. Some of his grandchildren brought him to the theatre, but afterwards he could never find the entrance to the tunnel, let alone go into it\'.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 55-56</div>
and in his Inquiry into Evil Spirits, chapter 12, Andrea Cesalpino confirms these points when he writes as follows. \'I am certainly aware of many treasure hunters\', he says, \'because of their great skills, but I don't know any who have been successful in finding anything. In Pisa, during my lifetime, some of them tried to dig, but stopped because they were defeated by the difficulty of what they had undertaken. Finally, after a year, they started to dig in a spot where places built by Nero were said to have existed-the place is now occupied by a convent-and where there was an enormous pine tree. But they were so plagued by evil spirits that they were forced to give up the moment they began because they were afraid. (During this time, many of the sisters living there were obsessed by an evil spirit)\'.

One should also note in connection with this that certain people are said to have found treasures by the use of magic in which they are experts, and by clever guesswork-the Saracen, for example, in the time of Guiscard the Norman in Apulia, whose magical deed \[is described\] by \[Bartolomeo\] Platina and \[Pandolfo\] Collenuccio. But Petrarch ascribes it more to practical good sense, and as far as this is concerned one will refer to the maxim that everyone can weigh up the subject on a scale which is balanced true.

<div align="center"><b>The Harmless Viper in the Peruvian Festival</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 57-58</div>
They also celebrate another festival no less superstitious than the one I mentioned earlier. In a small room they shut up a boy who has a beautiful face and is considered by the whole stronghold to be very good-looking, and order him to fast until his hair has grown long. Then magical conjurors, along with the elders, fetch him out and bring him to the house of one of his friends who has, for example, a very close connection with him. In the house, elderly women weep plaintively over the boy, and the common folk who are assembled and come together while this is happening, gradually cut off the boy\'s hair, starting at the front. Each person is offered a cooked goose. On the next day the magician dispatches \[some\] of the younger men to hunt wild animals, deputes others to make ready a suitable feast, orders girls to boil up some good wine and older folk to assemble musical instruments. From that moment, they start to play them, and from then on, those whom the magician sent away on his errands are free to pillage whatever they find out with anyone\'s house. They invite the neighbouring tribes to come to the feast wearing a variety of weapons.
The boy, who has been garlanded at the time of the feast, has an offensive weapon in one hand and a living viper hanging from the other. He sits in a chair which has been placed in splendidly decorated spot, and it is easy to deduce from what I have said that an evil spirit is at work, because the viper does not bite him. Several other dead vipers, too, are tied to the boy\'s body. These were caught by the young men when they went hunting and are placed on one side of the boy along with boiled and roasted geese. His other side is hemmed in by a large amount of wine. After this, soldiers invited to the feast come in according to their military rank and distinction, make a reverence to the viper, go up to the boy, drink the wine next to him, and take the food which has been prepared and placed next to the boy. Then they retrace their steps, make a reverence to the viper again, and ask for a second helping of food and drink. They spend three whole days in this fashion, after which they kill the viper. Then the women, (who have been shut up indoors for the whole period of the festival), come out shouting, \"Victory!\" During this kind of celebration an evil spirit frequently appears, urging \[people\] to drink, eat, and spend the festal days in cheerfulness and merriment. 

<div align="center"><b>The Magician Killed by a Snake in Salzburg</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Page 58</div>
The well-known example of the magician from Salzburg makes this point. When he was trying to force all the snakes-and this means one thousand of them!-into a furnace, he was finally killed by one huge old \[snake\] which struck out at him. An evil spirit, of course, had driven the rest of them into the furnace, but was unwilling to compel this one, preferring to rouse it against the magician. After all, if the rest of them had been driven into the furnace by the power of an incantation, that same power would have extended to this snake as well.

<div align="center"><b>The Greek Magician and the Ferocious Bull</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Page 59</div>
\[Paolo\] Grillando quite rightly says at the end of Question 8, \'On another occasion, during the time of Hadrian VI, before he arrived in the city as Pontiff, I saw a Greek magician who had a remarkable reputation because with words alone he had restrained the violence of a very ferocious bull which was part of a herd living in a wooded place. He rooted \[the bull\] to the spot like this, as I said, and, having humbled it, got hold of it by the horns and, with a quite fragile piece of rope, (which, however, had been made by magic), tethered it and led it where he wanted, in the middle of the night, for about four or five miles. This was seen by two hundred and more men\'.

<div align="center"><b>The Dogs Found in the Rock Quarry</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Page 60</div>
I absolutely believe this is what happened in the case of the dogs William of Newburgh spoke about as follows. \'While \[workmen\] were splitting open a huge rock in a particular quarry with their iron tools, two dogs appeared. They filled to capacity the space available to them in that rock which had no hole at all through which they could breathe\', (meaning \"perceptible hole\").

\'They seemed to belong to the breed of dogs known as \"greyhounds\", but they looked ferocious, smelled bad, and had no hair. It is said one of them died not long afterwards, but they say that Henry, Bishop of Winchester, played with the other one, which had a quite extraordinary appetite, for a good many days\', (History of the English, Book 1, chapter 28).

<div align="center"><b>The Toad in the Stone with a Gold Chain</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Page 60</div>
He follows this by saying that a toad was found in another stone with a small gold chain round its neck. I think an evil spirit added the chain and that the toad itself could have been born there, just as enormous flints have been found in cola-mines in Liège, inside which live toads have been formed and were lying hidden as though in their birth-canal.

<div align="center"><b>The Woman and the Monkeys on the Uninhabited Island</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 61-62</div>
One \[story\] which caps the rest, extraordinary though they may be, is the one reported by Castanheda in his Annals of Portugal. Because of a crime \[she had committed\], a woman was taken away by ship to an uninhabited island, and when she had been put ashore there a troop of monkeys, in which the place abounded, stood round her, growling. Then one who was rather big, to whom the rest of them gave way, arrived on the scene, took her gently by the hand, and led her away into an enormous cave. There he and the rest of the troop set before her a large number of apples, nuts, and various roots and, with a nod, invited her to eat. When she had finished, the wild creature forced her to have sex with him, an outrage he continued without interruption for many days, the result being that she gave birth to two children. The unhappy woman how much more preferable would death have been!-lived like this for several years until God in His mercy sent a ship there from Portugal. The soldiers came ashore to fetch water from a spring which was next to the cave, and by good fortune the monkey was not there. The woman came running up to the first human beings she had seen for a long time, threw herself at their feet, and begged them to take her away from \[the monkey\'s\] villainy and \[her\] appalling slavery. They took pity on her misfortune and agreed to take her on board with them. But-and I\'d like you to notice this point-the monkey bore down on them and, with uncouth gestures and deep growls, called back his \'wife\' (nonwife). When he saw that the sails had been spread, he ran forward and held up one of the children to its mother, threatening that if she did not come back, he would hurl it into the sea; and he was not slow in carrying out his threat. Then he dashed back to the cave and just as quickly returned to the shore, holding up the other child, made his threat, and drowned it, after which he pursued the ship closely, raging all the time, and swimming after it as long as he could until the waves proved too strong for him. The whole of Portugal can bear witness to this very famous incident. The King condemned the woman to be burned in Lisbon, but because of the prayers of certain people who begged for her life, he commuted the death sentence to perpetual imprisonment.

They are wild and ugly, they do not speak but shriek in a terrifying manner, and the Indians themselves consider them to be monsters.

To these examples I add a story which is entirely true. Right here in the Spanish Netherlands there was an abominable individual who had sex with a cow. People later saw that the cow had become pregnant, and after a few months she gave birth to a male offspring-not a calf, but a boy. More than one person was present to see him falling from the womb of his mother, the cow.

They picked him up from the ground and handed him over to a wet nurse. The boy grew up, was baptised and instructed in the precepts of the Christian religion, dedicated himself to the practice of religion and, on his father\'s behalf, earnestly devoted himself to works of penitence. To be sure, he was a complete human being, but one whose mind had bovine leanings which made him want to graze in the fields and chew the cud.

It is certain that a monster is sometimes born as a punishment from God. The punishment meted out to the Frieslanders of Dokkum because they murdered the saintly bishop, Boniface, and his companions tells us as much. \'God,\' says Kempius, \'has avenged the shameful death of these saints upon the children \[of those people\'s\] children, with the result that to this day random members of the families whose ancestors carried out such a wicked crime have thick whitish hair on the back of their head, rather like a brute animal\'s tail.

In Book 13 of his English History, Polydore Vergil writes to this effect. King Henry II was beginning to reveal himself as an enemy of the holy man, St Thomas of Canterbury. \'\[St Thomas\] started to be so slighted, despised, and hated by the common people that on one occasion when he came to Strode, a village on the bank of the River Medway, a river which flows near Rochester, the inhabitants of that area, eager to inflict some dishonour on the good Father they so despised, did not hesitate to cut off the tail of the horse he was riding, thus bringing down a perpetual disgrace on themselves: because afterwards, in accordance with God\'s will, it turned out that all the members of the family which had committed that crime were born with tails, as though they were brute beasts. But that mark of infamy, together with the family of those individuals, has long since disappeared.\'

She convinced her husband [of this] and conceived children by him.

Fifteen years ago, a beggar was carrying a child very painfully on his shoulders through Galicia and the Asturias in Spain, and I think [the child was one of these changelings. One of my Jesuit brethren found him en route near a river and, moved by pity, took a back seat on his mule so that he could take them across. The strong beast was scarcely able to land them on the other bank. A little later, he caught hold of the beggar who told him that the child was not a child but a devil who had promised him he would inveigle everyone into giving him alms, as long as he would carry [the devil] round in the guise of an ailing child swathed in bandages.

In order to guard her modesty, her father used to keep her in his bed. [But] when he defiled himself while he was dreaming, his semen descended into his daughter\'s womb and therefore the girl became pregnant. This was the result, and in his commentary on Genesis 19, [Alonso Tostado of Ávila] claims that an evil spirit can make the same thing happen.

<div align="center"><b>Discoveries of Giant Corpses in Sicily</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 71-71</div>
The subject is clearly an extensive one. I shall write down brief extracts [from Fazello]. In 1342, a corpse was found in a cave on Mt Eryx. It was of a quite extraordinary size and part of the back of its skull had the capacity of several Sicilian pecks. (Boccaccio mentions it, too, in Book 4, chapter 28 of his Genealogy of the Gods). In 1516 in the territory of Mazzarino, masons dug up the corpse of someone about twenty cubits tall. Its head was the size of a large round cask, and each of its molars weighed five ounces. [Fazello] says he saw them, and that he had in possession not a few other teeth belonging to giants which were dug up in Melilli, [each] weighing four ounces, and that he also possessed the almost preternaturally wide shoulder-blade of another giant from Hyccara [Carini]. In 1547, Simeone Pigliono gave him two other molars, each weighing four ounces, from a corpse eighteen cubits tall, [which had been found] near Palermo. In the following year, another corpse was discovered there by Giorgio Adorno, twenty cubits tall; and in 1550 a corpse was found at Calatrasi about twenty-two cubits tall, whose head measured about ten feet round. [Fazello] adds many similar [examples], but there is no reason for me to spend time enumerating each one of them. He notes the fact that although the rest of the bones fell to dust at a touch, the teeth remained intact. They were like ours, but bigger, whitish in colour, and free from decay. One used to see this long ago in the tooth from Antwerp as well.

He came across some [creatures] which had the shape and appearance of human beings but were very short in stature and black in colour. Their whole body was covered in thick hair. Their women came along with them, and their children who were even shorter than the men.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 76-76</div>
In Yorkshire, not far from where I was born, something extraordinary happened which I knew about from the time I was a child. Several miles away from the sea in the east there is a village, and next to it are the well-known waters commonly known as the "Vipse".

A peasant from this village, who had gone to see a friend in the next village, was returning, somewhat less than sober, late at night and (listen to this!) he heard the sounds of people singing and having a good time [which were coming] from a nearby hillock. (I have seen this hillock quite often. It is two or three furlongs away from the village.) Astonished that anyone would be rupturing the silence in the dead of night with cheerful celebrations, he wanted to investigate more closely and noticed an opening in the side of the hillock. He went up to it, looked inside, and saw a big house, brightly lit, full of men and women who were sitting down to what looked like a formal dinner. One of the waiters noticed him standing in the doorway and offered him a cup.

He took it, but deliberately refrained from drinking, poured the contents away, but kept the cup, and left quickly. The removal of the cup caused an uproar at the party and the guests chased after him, but he escaped because of the speed of the mule he was riding and retreated to his village along with his remarkable plunder. In the end, this vessel, which [was made] of an unknown material and had a strange colour and unusual shape, was offered as a gift to the King of England, Henry the Elder, and then, after he had refused it, to the Queen's brother David, (namely, the King of Scots) and was kept for very many years as one of the treasures of Scotland. A few years ago, I am reliably informed, William, King of Scots, surrendered it to Henry II who wanted to see it', [History] of English Affairs Book 1, chapter 38.

This distinguished man was in love with a woman and was unable to enjoy her companionship. So he invited an evil spirit to be his patron, and worshipped him under the guise of a ram. Later [the spirit] taught him how to pick up a besom and put it between his thighs, as though it were a horse. It would then take him instantaneously where he wanted [to go]'.

Among the Avignon witches [striges], (as [Sébastien] Michaëlis tells us in his Discourse of Spirits, annotation 6), they arrested a boy who told the judges that his father has taken him to the 'synagogue', (which is what they call their meeting), and that while he was there he had seen them carry out many wicked, dreadful things. In consequence, [he said], he was terrified and crossed himself and said Jesus, what is the meaning of this?' As soon as he had said it, the entire mob disappeared, and he found he was alone in that place. Next day he came back to his home which was about three miles away from the 'synagogue', and denounced his father to the judges, and this is why the boy's neighbours gave him the name 'masquillon', that is, 'little sorcerer' [sortiarius]. This boy was still a prisoner in Avignon when Michaëlis was writing his account in 1582.

Listen to another eye-witness [account] taken from [Paolo] Grillando whose words I am quite happy to write down. 'When this', (that is, of course, homage), 'has been done, he,' (the principal evil spirit), 'appoints an evil spirit to take custody of the woman, whom he must never leave, but serve her every wish; and whenever she happens to come to the theatricals, he will tell the woman this, bring her there, and give her instruction. Actually, this evil spirit keeps her company the way a husband does his wife. They often go to those assemblies, where a very large number of women get together, and they do not see the things I have mentioned mentally or intellectually or apparently.

They come to the foresaid places in their real, natural person in the following manner and ordernamely, first of all, one or two days before the assembly takes place, [the woman] is informed by the evil spirit who has been given custody of the woman how to prepare herself at such and such a time to come to the show. If the woman were to have a good reason which prevented [her attendance], he takes her and, provided her reason is genuine, excusable, and one she can legitimately offer as an excuse, she is given a hearing. Otherwise, if she were to pretend to have a reason which was not a reason for non-attendance, she would not be taken there against her will, but would stay at home. Nevertheless, as punishment for her lie, the evil spirit would torture her so vigorously and distress her so powerfully in mind and body with very great, continual pains and sickness internal and external, that she would have no peace inwardly day or night but would always be suffering affliction.

Everything she might do would have no effect and would come to nothing as she did it, to the point where, to make all her sufferings cease, she would confess her fault and promise, even to the extent of swearing an oath, that she would not refuse any more to go [to the meetings]. Now, when she promised to go, the moment the night and hour arrived, a voice like that of a human would summon her. [It came] from the evil spirit himself, although they do not call him an evil spirit, but 'little teacher'. (Some women [call] their teacher "Martinet" or "Little Martin".) she had been summoned this way, she would pick up a small box of ointment and smear certain parts and bits of her body with it. After doing this, she would leave the house and would always find her "little teacher" waiting for her at the door, in the form of a goat. The woman said she would mount on his back and cling hard with her hands on to his hair. The goat would immediately rise through the air and, in a very short time, carry her off to an almond-tree in Benevento where he would put her down gently', etc. [Question 7, no. 28]. It is worth noting that the rest [of the passage] agrees with what the other scholars I cited have written usually takes place in a meeting.

<div align="center"><b>Lucrezia Abandoned Naked in the Thorn Field</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 81-82</div>
In Book 2, question 7 of his Divinatory Magicians, Paolo Grillando relates that in 1524 a woman called Lucrezia was brought before him in his capacity as inquisitor. While she was being taken home from a witches' meeting [congregatione ludorum] immediately after dawn, she heard the bell being rung to call the people to morning prayer, and all of a sudden, the evil spirit who was carrying her abandoned her in a field full of thorns. By chance a young man she knew was passing through [the field] and the wretched woman call to him by his name. The young man, seeing she was completely naked, was afraid to approach unless she covered her private parts with her thighs and unbound hair. She kept on coaxing him gently and finally he came near her and asked how she was feeling and why she was there. At first, she hid all the other details and told him a lot of lies until the young man did not believe her and said he would not help her unless she told him the truth. She made him promise to keep it secret and [then] confessed what had happened to her and why it had happened. The young man took her home and she showered him with presents, but in the end, forgetting he had given his word [to keep quiet], he told the story to one person and then to another and so, little by little, the story leaked out. The woman was arrested, and the young man forced to provide evidence of the truth. (All this is what Grillando tells us.)

<div align="center"><b>The Husband's Discovery and Journey to the Benevento Sabbat</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 81-82</div>
He adds another [exemplary story] which is as follows. A woman from the diocese of Sabina used to profess this devilish craft, and because her husband had his suspicions about it, he questioned her on several occasions, but she always denied [any knowledge of it]. Her husband, however, continued to be suspicious and anxiously kept on pressing her for the truth. He acted in such a cunning way that one night he saw her smearing herself with an ointment. Once she had done this, he saw her leaving very quickly, like a bird, swooping down from the upper storey of the house to the lower. Her husband followed her in order to see where she was going, [but then] he saw her no longer, and when he came to the front door of the house, he found it closed. This caused him great astonishment. The next day, however, the husband questioned his wife again about what he was anxious to know, and she, (as one might expect), kept on saying she had no idea [what he was talking about]. But so that the woman would not be able to deny things any more, her husband told her plainly everything he had seen her do the previous night and then gave her a good beating with his cudgel, threatening to beat her harder if she did not tell the truth. But he did promise to forgive her if she told him everything.

So, the woman understood she could not keep her secret any longer, told her husband the truth frankly, and asked his forgiveness, which her husband granted on condition she take him to gatherings of this kind. In order to make sure of his forgiveness, she readily promised what he asked, and fulfilled her promise with Satan's permission. So, she took her husband to the place where the entertainments [ludi] were taking place. He had a good look at the sport, the dances, and everything else, and finally sat down at table with everyone else to eat. He thought the food was tasteless and asked for salt. There was none on the table and although he asked for it again and again, he was never given any. Finally, after he persisted in asking and had waited for a very long time, he was given salt, at which he said, 'Now praise be to God the salt has arrived!' When he said these words, the evil spirits, who run away when they hear God being praised, made an immediate retreat. Everyone else disappeared, the lamps were extinguished, and he stayed there, alone and naked, until dawn broke and he saw some shepherds.

He asked them the name of the district in which he was, and they replied, 'the countryside of Benevento in the Kingdom of Naples'. This was a hundred miles away from where the man lived and in consequence, even though he was rich, he was forced to beg along the road so that he could get back to his own home. The moment he arrived he accused his wife of being a vampire-witch [lamiae], and related everything that had happened, (the way it has been told here), to the judges and they, upon investigating the whole business thoroughly, as was proper, found that everything I have been saying was true, and the woman's confession confirmed it.

<div align="center"><b>The Daughter Transported to Her Cousin's Bedroom in Venice</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 82-83</div>
The Franciscan Alfonso a Castro, in his chapter 16, adds that he can give an account of many other pieces of evidence which he had come to know, from entirely trustworthy witnesses, [referred to events which] had taken place in Spain. Bartolomeo della Spina, Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace, gives us examples which are no less reliable in chapter 17 ff. of his [Inquiry into] Night-Flying Witches, and I shall write down one of them. 'A young woman', he says, 'who was living with her mother in Bergamo, was found one night in Venice in the bedroom of a kinsman. She was discovered naked in the morning and was recognised because she was his cousin. When they asked her how she had come there, or what she was doing there and why, she started to wail, and after they got her dressed, she suddenly told them the following story. "Last night, I was lying awake in bed and saw my mother, who thought I was asleep, get out of bed, pull of her underwear, and smear her body with an ointment she took out of a little pot she removed from underneath some bricks.

Then she took a stick she had ready there, climbed on it the way one mounts a horse, and was carried away out of the window, and after that I did not see her at all. Then I got out of bed, too, and anointed my body the way I had seen my mother do and was carried away out of the window. I was immediately brought here where I saw my mother waiting in ambush for a boy who was lying in the bed. I was frightened when I saw that my mother was also startled by my arrival and was threatening to attack me, so I invoked the name of the Lord Jesus and the Blessed Virgin, and after that I did not see my mother and was left there, naked and alone". Once the girl had told her story, her cousin wrote down everything she had said for the Father Inquisitor in Bergamo.

[The Inquisitor] arrested the woman and when she was put to the torture, she confessed everything and added that she had been carried off by her evil spirit more than fifty times so that she could kill the foresaid cousin's child, but that she never been successful because his parents always protected him well with the sign of the cross and holy prayers'.

<div align="center"><b>The Coal-Miner's Pursuit to the Count's Wine-Cellar</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 83-83</div>
[Bartolomeo] also adds another example, and I shall write this one down, too. 'One Antonio Leo, a coal-miner from Ferrara [a Montagna] in Valtellina, told me this year that he had found out the things written below from someone in his home district, to whom they had actually happened. Because of what many people told him, this man became suspicious that his wife was going on a "voyage", (that is, to a meeting of witches [sagarum]), 'while he was asleep at night. One night he pretended to be fast asleep and observed his wife get out of bed, anoint herself with ointment from a small pot she had kept hidden, and straight away she was nowhere to be seen. Her husband was stunned and, drawn by curiosity, got out of bed and did the same as his wife. Immediately, (so it seemed to him), he was carried off up the chimney-which was how, (he thought), his wife had also risen upwards-and was brought to the wine-cellar of a noble Count.There he found his wife along with several other people. When she saw him, his wife immediately made a sign and she and the others left, leaving her husband in that place. He was found by the house-servants next morning and, amid uproar, arrested as a thief and brought before the Count. He was given time to speak and gave a vigorous account of what had happened, as a result of which his wife was arraigned before the inquisitor and at length confessed and paid the appropriate penalty for her crimes.'

<div align="center"><b>Claude Choteau's Encounter with the Morèle Cleft Dancers</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 83-84</div>
This is what Bartolomeo della Spina tells us. Still better witnesses are three examples of witch-transportation Nicholas Rémy adds to these three Italian ones in his Worship of Evil Spirits Book 1, chapter 14, of which I cannot deprive the reader. This is what he writes. 'In May 1589, villagers were celebrating a rural festival in Luz, which is a village not without a certain reputation in the foothills of the Vosges. Claude Choteau was coming back from this village at nightfall to a neighbouring village called Wisembach and had already climbed up a good part of the hill which rises between the two villages when he was battered by a sudden whirlwind. Astonished, he stood still and looked around [to see if there was any reason anywhere for such an uncommon occurrence, since the air was perfectly calm and still everywhere else. He noticed six masked women in a retired spot-the locals call it the Morèle cleft. They were dancing round a table set with a lot of gold and silver, throwing their heads all over the place as they did so and [acting like] people who are driven hither and thither by fits of madness.

There was also a man on a black bull, standing near them. He was looking at them as though he were someone in the street with nothing else to do. In the meantime, [Claude] stood where he was while he recovered himself and looked at the whole scene more closely. While he was doing this, the entire mob disappeared in an instant, as if it withdrew from his sight. So, his fear left him, and he resumed his journey. He had already got over the summit of the hill when would you believe it!-those women started following him closely behind, throwing their heads about as before and preserving a deep or agreed silence. A man with a coal-black face was walking ahead of them. His hands were curved, like grappling-hooks, and he was preparing to let them loose on [Claude's] face, had not [Claude] not drawn his sword and thwarted him. But because he did so, [the man] stopped taunting him and, as though in fear of his life, vanished.

Nevertheless, the women made another appearance and the man who, as I said, was seated on a bull and was watching their dances, was with them. Choteau, who had now become more confident, came closer to him and said, "Oh, there you are, Didier Gaxet!"-that being the man's name-Please, protect me if you can. Honestly, I give you my solemn word I'll not say anything at all about what I have seen". Hardly had he finished speaking when a whirlwind or cloud swept round him again, and when at last he spun himself round and freed himself from it, he found he was alone on the ground in a place a long way away from the path. But, by retracing his steps to where he had last been on it, he stumbled on to it and took himself back home as fast as he could.

Three days after giving this testimony, he was summoned before the investigating judge again and added the following to the very large number of details he had given earlier. He remembered, (he said), that when he had gone closer to the table to see what kind of a banquet has been set out on it, an evil spirit had immediately flown at his face with his nails, and while he was engaged in defending himself with his sword, he had been lifted up once again by a rather violent wind and carried off to the Combrimons Falls, a spot not less than two hundred paces away.

Lest anyone think this was perhaps the raving of a drunk frightened by the loneliness of the night and the place, in Sandeodat, on 22nd May, 1589, one of those women, Barbelline Caxet, had also said the same thing to the investigating [judge] a month earlier in almost the same words, adding that Desiré Gaxet and his wife had given Choteau two measures of wheat and two cows' milk cheeses to keep his mouth shut about what he had seen. Consequently, when the two of them were brought face to face, they agreed in every particular except one which was that Barbelline said the evil spirit had not tried to lay hands on Choteau because he had gone near the table-this was a lie he had told during his statement-but because he had been on the point of stealing a gold cup from it'.

<div align="center"><b>Johann von Hembach's Fall from the Meeting Tree</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 84-85</div>
Rémy gives another example of the same thing. 'Johann von Hembach had scarcely ceased being a youngster when his mother, a worker of poisonous magic [venefica], took him with her to nocturnal meetings of evil spirits and, on the grounds that he knew how to play the pipes, told him to play them and to climb a tree close by so that he could be heard more clearly. He did so and, being free to have a good look at their jumping and dancing, was astonished at their noveltyeverything there was so preposterous and ridiculous-and casually said, "Good God, where has this silly, stupid mob come from?" Scarcely had he said this than he fell to the ground and hurt one of his shoulders. He begged those who were standing near him to help him but found himself alone.

He talked about this quite openly, and people had different opinions about it-some maintained it was a vision, others that it had actually taken place. But them something happened which removed people's doubts, because one of the women who had taken part in the dancing, Catherine Prevost, was arrested not long afterwards in Freissen on 2nd September 1589 on suspicion of casting lots for divination [sortilegii]. She gave an account of the whole business as written above without being interrogated first, unaware of the version Von Hembach had already propagated. Otilla Kervers and Agnes Eisarbz, who were sentenced for [practising] poisonous magic [veneficii] the following year-Kervers in Werderst on 6th and 7th August 1590 and Eisarbz in Dieuze on 3rd November 1590-each in turn made the same declaration and in addition made it evidentially stronger by giving the name, (Mayebuch), of the place where it happened'.

<div align="center"><b>Nicole Lagbernhard's Encounter with Cloven-Footed Dancers</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 85-85</div>
The third [example] is not only a clear piece of testimony, but also makes as clear as daylight what had happened. It goes as follows. 'Nicole Lagbernhard was coming back from the mill in Guermange to Assenoncourt on 25th July 1590 and was making her way, at full noon, next to a hedge which was part of a wood, when she noticed men and women dancing in a circle and jumping about in the neighbouring ploughed field. But because they were doing so with their backs turned to each other, contrary to the usual way other people did it, she took a closer look and saw that, in addition to this, there were, mixed with those who were dancing and jumping in the circle, some who were deformed because they had the feet of goats and oxen. Almost dead with fear, she began to invoke the saving name of Jesus, (as people do when something unlucky and inauspicious threatens them), and to ask Him humbly that it might be possible for her to return home safe and sound. At that, all the dancers seemed to vanish, except for one called Petter Gross-Petter who was borne quickly into the air. But a small brush, such as bakers usually use to clean their oven before they put their bread in it, was seen to escape [his grasp] and fall; and while this was going on, Nichole, too, was swept up by a rather strong wind, started panting and puffing, and could scarcely draw breath, and when she got home she lay in bed, ill, for three whole days.

She and her neighbours talked about this, and the news spread through the whole district. At the first opportunity, the Petter I mentioned rather hot-headedly brought an action before a judge, so that he might not seem to be acknowledging and confessing to such a great crime by keeping quiet about it. In the end, however, he made up his mind to abandon [his action] because he was afraid that, since he was having no success with his case, he would be creating greater danger for himself. So, after due reflection, he abandoned it. This increased the suspicion against him even more, and many people considered it was because he had a bad conscience that he was [now] taking no notice of a wrong of which he had at first been so acutely aware.

So, the judge investigated his life and behaviour the more carefully, and when he discovered, by means of reliable tokens of proof, that the case [against Petter] was not without grounds, he arrested him and prevailed on him to co-operate and confess his crime and, in the end, to expose and convict the others who had taken part in the crime with him. Among them were Barbelline, wife of Jean Latome [who was tried] at Dieuze on 27th January 1591 and Mayette, wife of Laurent Grosmaire, likewise [tried] at Dieuze on 16th February 1591. They acknowledged, separately but in the same words, that the information their accomplice Petter had disclosed about the Sabbat, when they danced back-toback along with cloven-footed individuals in their midst, was true.

On 1st March, 1591, a third person, Jean Michel, a herdsman from Dieuze, agreed with [what] these women [had said in their] confession, and added that while all this was taking place he was doing the job of pipe-player by putting to his mouth a sheep-hook someone happened to offer him, and letting his fingers flutter over it, as though he were playing notes on real pipes. When Nicole, (as has been said), full of fear, called upon Jesus and made the sign of the cross, he fell headlong from the rather high branch of the oak-tree on which he was sitting. Then he was caught up in a whirlwind and carried off to a meadow called "Weiller" where, not long before, he had left his flock grazing.

But in the end, the weightiest and most powerful piece of evidence relating to this incident was that the day after Nichole had told [people about it], the place where they had been dancing in a circle appeared to have been trodden down in a ring-the kind horse-trainers have to exercise their horses in a circuit. It was also chequered with recent traces of hooves belong to goats and oxen, and these remained visible until the field was brought under the plough and furrowed the following winter. Verbal evidence was given by Nicel Klein, Didier Vernex, and Gaspar Schneider, and they were all brought quickly to court and questioned about it by the judge.'

<div align="center"><b>The Servant's Hay Trough Transportation to the Wyck Cavern</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 86-87</div>
No less confirmatory is another [example] from Baudouin van Ronss's Letters on Medicine, [chapter] 50 which tells us something which had happened in Holland in his own day.²⁴² 'In the village of Oostbroek, not far from Utrecht, there was a widow who had taken in a male servant because her situation demanded she get help with her household expenses. Quite often, in the dead of night, as soon as the house-servants had gone to bed, he would look through the lattice [over his window] in the usual nosy way servants have, and see his mistress come into the stable, make her way to a specific, pre-arranged spot, and then stretch out her hands and grasp hold of the hay trough next to the horse's stall. Wondering what on earth she meant by this behaviour, he decided to try doing the same thing at the same time, without his mistress's knowledge.

So, on the spur of the moment when his mistress came and did what she usually did and seemed to have gone away, he followed quickly, took a good look at the spot and then, imitating his mistress's example, threw his arms round the hay trough. Immediately he was snatched up into the air and carried off to the town of Wyck, to a cavern hidden underground, where he found a company of female workers of harmful magic [maleficarum] talking to each other about the acts of harmful magic [maleficiis] they had done. His mistress and her companions were astonished at her servant's unexpected appearance, and she asked him what trick he had used to get there in an instant, and why he had done so.

He told her, step by step, how he had done it and she immediately began to turn incandescent with rage, afraid that the result would be that those clandestine meetings at night would be brought to an end. So, she decided to talk to her partners in crime and [ask them] what they thought should be done in this awkward situation. Finally, they agreed among themselves to be friendly and make an exception of him, but that they would make him promise and swear an oath to remain silent and not communicate or reveal to anyone the secrets which he-beyond his merit or comprehension-might happen to see. He, for his part, made no such promise, but spoke to them in soothing tones and, with a view to getting them to behave with greater mildness, pretended that all his desires were fixed on one thing-that they would be gracious enough at some future date to let him attend their "witches' guild" [sortilegiarum collegio].

In the meantime, while they were discussing this, the minutes glided by, and it was time to go. Once again, his mistress stirred up uncertainty about whether he should be sent home, which would be dangerous for the whole assembly, or killed for the general good. In the end they all agreed to choose the more merciful of the two and decided to send him back once they had bound him by an oath [of silence]. His mistress undertook this task and promised that, once he had given his word, she would take him home on her shoulders. They got themselves ready and were [then] carried swiftly through the air by a wind from the east. But now, listen to this! They had covered a good part of their journey when there came into view a lake covered with a jungle of reeds. This provided the maleficent old woman with an opportunity and, fearful lest the youth repent of his (pretended) initiation into their ghastly festivals, she saw a way of getting rid of him. She shot forward suddenly and threw him off her back, hoping, one must suspect, that the violence of the fall would kill him and that he would be swallowed up on the depths of the lake. But how very merciful is God, who does not seek the death of a sinner, but rather that he be converted and live, because God put a stop to the madwoman's

intention and did not allow the innocent youth to be drowned. Indeed, He gave the young man the considerably fairer boon of living right up to the present day. You see, as chance and good luck would have it, he did not receive a fatal blow when he fell into the lake, and the violent impetus of his descent was somehow broken by the reeds. It was starting to become light. The poor wretch's body was tortured by a thousand agonising pains, and the only part of it which worked was his tongue. So, he kept on groaning and gasping for a long time until some huntsmen who were passing gathered round him, extremely surprised by the unexpected sound of wailing, and found a man who had dislocated both his hips. They asked where he had come from, and what kind of misfortune had happened to him, and he told them everything, just as it had happened. He was brought back in a carriage to Utrecht where the noble Johan van Culemborg, the city magistrate, struck with consternation and full of astonishment because of the strangeness of what had happened to the man, subjected the details [of his story] to close examination and then ordered his men to hunt down the lady with the evil eye [fascinatrix era], arrest her, and put her in chains; and the moment she came into the magistrate's hands, she confessed everything', etc.

<div align="center"><b>The Inquisitor's Curious Witnesses Beaten by Witches</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 88-89</div>
[Bernard da] Como tells us the same exemplary story when he makes clear the truth of a denunciation. Unbelievers may put it to the test. 'Almost fifty years ago now, in Mendrisio', he says, 'a town which was right next to Como, an inquisitor by the name of Master Bartolommeo de Homate, an official called Signior Lorenzo de Concorezio, and a notary, Giovanni de Fossato, were proceeding against these witches [striges]. One day the official, drawn by curiosity and wanting to test whether witches [strigae] would really go to their "play" physically, arranged a meeting [with one of them] and on a Wednesday came, with his notary and someone else, to a certain spot outwith the town, just as he had told the witch [strigae] in advance.

When the three men were almost there, they saw several people gathered together in the presence of someone-the Devil in the form of a goat-who was sitting in the manner of a great lord and, do you know, suddenly, at the Devil's command-and God permitted this because of the men's inquisitiveness-all the people in that gathering struck the official and his companions with sticks so hard that within fifteen days the official, the notary, and the third man died from the beating they had received. This is what he says.

'Another witness of this apparent transformation of night-flying witches [striges] into cats, a cobbler from Ferrara by the name of Filippo, made the following declaration to me under oath in court earlier this year. Three months previously, he said, a certain witch [strix] had undertaken to cure his child of a bewitchment for which, perhaps, she herself may have been responsible, on condition he would not stop her from coming near his child if he were to see any female cats fawning or behaving in a playful manner round him. Well now, that same day, an hour after she had left the house, Filippo and his wife notice a large female cat they had never seen before, coming towards the child at a fast pace. This frightened his parents, and they made several attempts to drive it away but were distressed to see that it kept coming back. Finally, they lost both their patience and their temper with it. So, they shut the door and, while the cat raced round looking all over the place for a way to escape, Filippo took his time and then threw a spear at it and at last landed it a very heavy blow which forced it to hurl itself out of a window high up in the wall. As a result, the whole of the cat's body looked as though it been squashed flat. Now, from that moment onwards the elderly witch [strix] was confined to her bed for a good long time, since every bone in her body had been broken, a fact which strengthened [the parents'] suspicion that the woman was indeed a witch [stiga] and had subjected their child to the enchantment which was causing him very serious distress. The marks and blows the cat had received, you see, looking like the marks one finds on the bodies of the sick, were found on the elderly woman'.

<div align="center"><b>Peasant's Boat Stuck by Toad-Witch in Flanders</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 96-97</div>
Not quite five years ago, in a village in the west of Flanders, not far from Diksmuide, very near the confluence of the Iperlee and the IJzer, while a plague caused by the evil eye [pestis fascinaria] was spreading in a remarkable fashion, I happened to hear the following story from a monk, a trustworthy individual, who was in the neighbourhood at the time. A peasant and his son were drinking in an ale-house, and out of the corner of his eye the man noticed that the serving-trollop was chalking up double the amount of ale when, as is their custom, he drank a toast to her. He pretended not to notice, but when he and his son had had enough, he called the landlady over and asked her for his bill. He was charged the sum which had been marked up in chalk, but refused to pay, and after the two of them had traded many words, he flung down on the table the amount he knew was correct and left. Boiling with indignation the woman called out, 'You won't be able to get back home today, or I'm not the woman I am!' But he paid her threats no heed and walked off. When he reached the stream where he had left his boat, however, neither he nor his son, (who was pretty strong), could shift it from the bank, even though they leaned on their poles with all their strength. You would think it had been nailed down in the mud. Now, it so happened that two or three soldiers were marching past, so the peasant hailed them. 'Hey, mates! Come and help us get this boat off the bank. I'll pay you for it, and you can have a good drink on me'. They answered his call, came along, and pushed as hard as they could, but they pushed for a long time to no purpose. Then one of them, sweating and gasping for breath, said, 'Why don't be unload all this stuff from the boat? Perhaps we'll find it easier to get it down to the water if it's empty'. So that's what they did and then-pay attention to this!-they saw a huge sallow toad in the bottom of the boat, looking at them with glittering eyes. One of the soldiers did not pick it up but drilled a hole in its swollen throat with the point of his sword and threw it into the water. There, as if dead, it rolled over on to its back, belly upwards. The rest of the soldiers inflicted further wounds on it while it was afloat, and suddenly the boat came free. The peasant was pleased and brought his helpers back to the same alehouse he had left earlier. He asked for a drink, and the waitress brought him one. He asked after the landlady and was told she had become very ill and was in bed, dying. 'Stupid woman!' he said. 'Do you think I'm drunk? I left her standing over there scarcely half an hour ago, and she was in good health and a nasty frame of mind, just like you. I'm going to go and see what's going on'. He went into the bedroom and found that the woman had died of wounds which had dug into and slashed open her neck and stomach. 'How did she get these wounds?' he exclaimed. The waitress insisted she did not know and was sure the woman had not set foot outwith the house. The case went before a magistrate who came to the conclusion that the wounds had been caused by both slashing and stabbing blows, and that they had appeared in the very same places in which the soldiers had struck the toad. The toad itself was nowhere to be found.

It is about ten years ago that one Peter Stumpf was put to death in Bedburg, a small town in the territory of Köln, because for more than twenty years he had consorted with an evil spirit in the form of a succuba. She had given him a wide belt, and when he put it on, he and others thought he was turned into a wolf. In this form he had ripped out the throats of fifteen children and eaten their brains. He had tried to devour his two daughters-in-law, and he had treated his own daughter and his godmother as his wives. All this is well-known from court records and from engravings which are openly on sale.

produce a single piece of evidence from Holy Scripture, which it is worth our while to explain-Nebuchadnezzar's [change] into an ox, and that of Lot's wife into a statue of salt. But since both these happened as the result of divine power, they can have no importance for changes brought about by evil spirits. In the case of Nebuchadnezzar, too, most Fathers [of the Church] deny that he assumed the form of an OX or the likeness of an ox's body. They interpret [the incident] simply [by saying] that his reason was so estranged that he believed he was an OX. Not to drag out the argument, it seems to me that an explanation more consonant with what Holy Scripture says, the explanation of St Gregory in his Moralia Book 5, chapter 8, and reason, is that of interpreters [who say] that the condition of the King's body changed into the constitution of an ox, that his human shape had degenerated to some extent into that of a wild animal, and that he had received internal senses which were like those of brute beasts. So as a result, he started to walk on all fours, as cattle do, to eat hay, avoid human beings, and spend his time in the open air.

They found a speaking head among the corpses, and when it realised there were people in its vicinity, it said, \"Why are you standing there so amazed, gentlemen?

I am a Christian. I fell, unconfessed and unshriven, in this war. Mother Mary is not allowing me to be condemned to eternal torture. She has kept me still in control of my tongue so that I can confess my wrong-doings and purify my mind with Apostolic rites. So please, send for a priest to hear my confession and give me absolution\". Asked why he had deserved such a great favour from the Virgin, he replied that during life he had had a particular devotion to her, celebrated her seven feast-days every year with very great reverence, and honoured her on religious fast-days \[by taking\] only bread and water. So, they sent for a priest from the nearest village, and he duly heard \[the man\'s\] confession, who received remission of all his sins and, after receiving this final cleansing, suddenly fell silent and remained quiet ever after\'.

Polycritus married Locrides and slept with her for three nights. On the third day he died, leaving her pregnant, and she gave birth to a monster of both sexes. It was brought into the midst of a meeting of the people so that they could be consulted about what this presaged, or what should be done about it. Polycritus appeared as a ghost in the middle of the people and predicted that a disaster would come to the Aetolians and Locrians, and that the people would have no power to resist it. He removed his monstrous son\'s head, swallowed \[the rest of\] him, and vanished, and not long afterwards the head spoke of the same disasters.

But divine justice wanted to put an end to his roguery, and at length his enemies discovered him sitting gingerly on a stove near a window; and since he had no fear of them while they were laying siege to him, they ran him through with their swords and spears without warning via the window, and he died a miserable death in that place because of his crimes\'.

She revealed to the mayor of the city the part of her body which had been marked in this fashion by her evil spirit, and he had the idea of carrying out a test \[to see\] whether what people used to say about its insensitivity was true. So, he ordered a small pin to be thrust into it and rammed down as far as it would go. This was done in front of quite a large crowd of people. No blood at all appeared from the wound and the wise-woman \[saga\] gave those who were watching not the slightest sign that she was feeling pain. Thus Rémy, Book 1, chapter 5.

Her skin had been shaved in accordance with the usual practice, and because of this a scar on top of her bare forehead became visible. The investigating judge therefore suspected the truth-namely, that this was an imprint of her evil spirit\'s fingernail, which used to be hidden by her hair before \[she was shaved\]. He ordered a small pin to be thrust very deeply into it, and when this had been done it was seen that she had no sense of being hurt, and that no blood, or very little, flowed from the wound. But she persisted in denying the truth and kept on saying that the numbness stemmed from an old blow from a stone. Not long afterwards, however, when she had been put to the torture, she not only admitted that \[the mark\] had been inflicted on her by an evil spirit, but she also gave a detailed account of the very many other things she had suffered most undeservedly at his hands.

In the book by Claude Caron I have already recommended, he writes that the mark of the notorious wise-woman \[sagae\], Bayaronne, which was well hidden on her left thigh, very indistinctly outlined, the size of a penny-piece with, as it were, fine threads running out from its centre to the periphery, was entirely and completely insensitive.

<div align="center"><b>The Reactive Mark of Jean Del Vaulx</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 107-107</div>
Just such a mark was seen on the back of Jean Del Vaulx, and Pierre Dheure, the investigating judge in the affair, noticed something remarkable. If you ran a needle or a pen-nib quite deeply into it, the accused did not feel any pain and did not ask what was going on. But if you threatened his chain-mark from behind at a distance with a finger held out stiff, in such a way that he could not see you, the accused man would suddenly be convulsed as though he were being tortured severely. I find no physical cause for this. I suspect a moral one-that \[the man\'s\] utterly arrogant evil spirit was smarting at being despised, and that this made him angry and furious at the torture of his slave.

While looking for a sheep, he went into a cave during the midday heat, was overcome by deep sleep, and slept, according to Pausanias, for 77 years, (67, according to Eudemus, and slightly fewer, according to others). Later on he woke up, thought he had had forty winks, and began to look for his little sheep. Perhaps there is a natural explanation for why these people slept, although in the case of Epimenides I should rather attribute it to an evil spirit.

(She would, however, frequently burst into tears). She had the usual dirt in her nostrils and ears, and she used to sleep and stay quiet for quite a long time. But she did not discharge faeces or urine either from her anus or from her female parts. This gave rise to a great deal of argument-among the Italians, by Simone Porzio, and among the Germans by an eye-witness, one of the physicians who was observing the girl, Gerhard Buchholtz.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 109-110</div>
In the town of Esgueira in Portugal, nine leagues from Coimbra, there lived a man of good family who had a daughter called Maria Pacecho. When she was of the age at which she would begin to menstruate, a male member burst from her places instead of a fluid humour-it had either lain hidden inside her or came out of her in some other fashion-and so a post-pubertal young man suddenly appeared out of the girl. When she became a man, she also took the name Manoel Pacecho. He went on board ship, set out for India, performed brave deeds, acquired the reputation of being an active soldier, as well as great wealth, and on his return to his own country, took as his wife a woman of good family. Amato makes no mention of children, but says he remained beardless, and that his face had a feminine look to it-signs that his manliness was not altogether complete.

Secondly, Torquemada tells us he had heard from a friend, a man with a considerable reputation and who was entirely trustworthy, that not far from the city of Beneventana in Spain, the wife of a peasant who was moderately well-off was treated in less than kindly fashion by her husband because she was barren. Sick of being treated badly, she ran away one night, dressed as a male house-servant and, thus accoutred, she passed herself off as a man in various places and earned her living by working as a servant. After some time, either because the natural heat \[she had\] inside her would have this power, or because her imagination, produced and strengthened by her continually wearing men\'s clothes and doing men\'s work, acquired this power, the fact is she discovered she had turned into a man. So, having been a wife for a long time, she decided to act as a husband and joined herself in matrimony to a woman. Her secret remained hidden for a long time because \'he\' did not dare to tell it to anyone, until somebody who had known her very well before noticed that her face was very similar to that of the peasant\'s wife who had run away. He asked whether, by chance, she was the woman\'s brother, and she told him the whole story, just as it had happened, and this is how it came to light.

She was dancing rather energetically when, all of a sudden, male organs burst out of her, and she was changed into a man. During the sacrament of confirmation, the Bishop of Soissons gave her the name \'Germain\', and this is what people started to call her. Later on, a beard grew on her chin. She lived a long time-into very old age-but never married. \[Montaigne\] attributes the change to her vivid imagination, but I add that her physical constitution was tending in that direction.

Her teeth grew back, her hair turned dark, the wrinkles and folds in her skin filled out, her pendulous, shrivelled breasts swelled up like those of a young girl, and in the end her features, face, and entire bodily carriage made her look like a young woman. As a result, shocked by the novelty of her situation, out of modesty she began to withdraw from everyone's gaze.

Another lengthy period of forgetfulness happened to the Englishman, Simon Thurway. \[His memory\] drained away because of God\'s just punishment.

He was a very clever logician and had a great reputation as Professor of the Liberal Arts in Paris, \[but\] he was filled more with knowledge which puffs a man up than with charity which edifies and was not afraid to boast in the Schools that he knew the whole of Christ\'s law and could demolish it by overruling it. But he was struck so suddenly by forgetfulness that he could not remember his basic letters, could not recite the Lord\'s Prayer, and did not know how to read. While Nicholas of Durham was still a young man, he saw him being taught his letters by his own son, and \'\[Nicholas\]\', says Matthew Paris in Book 7 of his History of the English, \'told me about it while I was writing this\'. It happened in about 1201. (Trithemius says that Simon came from Tournai, but he is wrong because \[Simon\] was an Englishman from Cornwall. He is also mentioned in Book 15 of Polydore \[Vergil\'s\] History of England).

Johannes Nider has left us a passage about the initiation of vampire-witches \[lamiarum\], and in this \[passage\] there is a confession by one of them. \'We lay siege to little children who have not yet been baptised, or even to those who have been baptised, especially if they are not protected by the sign of the cross and prayers. We kill them with our rituals while there are in their cradles or lying beside their parents, and afterwards it is thought they have been smothered or have died in some other way. We take them secretly from their graves, boil them down in a cauldron until the flesh has almost entirely come away from the bones and one can swallow it and drink it. From the more solid part of this matter, we make an ointment which is suitable for what we want to do-our \[magical\] practices and our shape-changing. We fill a flask or a bottle with the runnier humour, and once anyone has drunk any of this, to the accompaniment of a few rituals, he immediately becomes a participant in and a master of our sect\', \[The Ant-Hill 5.3\] This is the confession of a woman. It is followed by another which seems to be that of a man. It adds the other ceremonies used in their abominable initiation and advancement to the hellish office of \'Master\'. This is the order in which I was led astray. First, on Sunday, before the holy water is blessed, the person who is about to become an apprentice enters the church with the Masters \[of the craft\] and there, in front of them, he denies Christ, his faith, his baptism, and the Catholic Church. Next, he pays homage to the \"Magisterulus\", that is, \"the Little Master\", which is the only title they use for the evil spirit, and finally he drinks from the bottle I mentioned earlier. Once he has done this, he immediately feels himself receiving and retaining a mental image of our craft and of the principal rituals of this sect. This is how I was led astray, as was my wife\', etc.

<div align="center"><b>The Devil's Temptation of Ignatius</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Page 119</div>
This was undoubtedly the stratagem whereby the ancient serpent tried unsuccessfully to deceive Ignatius, the founder of my Society. Let me write down the whole thing in the words of \[Pedro de\] Ribadaneira. \'But visions, which he saw in the midst of his studies\'-he is talking about grammatical studies\'began to disturb him very frequently and in large numbers. He wanted to commit to memory the inflections of nouns and verbs, but such a great abundance of divine thoughts started to pour into his mind that he was unable to learn anything new at all, and if anything had stuck in his memory before this, it started to flow away utterly and completely. Nor was he able either to prevent thoughts of this kind from coming, or to drive them away when they started, even though he zealously made every effort \[to do so\]. Shocked by the strangeness of the situation, he asked, why does this happen when I am praying, when I am making my confession and receiving the bread which transcends its substance, when I am awake, and when I scourge myself? When I survey all the spiritual gifts I receive from God, such frequent, such great, and such powerful \[moments of enlightenment do not present themselves to me. So, when I am engaged in doing unimportant things and am not thinking about God when I am close to God, why do such beautiful images and heavenly illuminations come to my mind? I recognise, I do recognise how clever this most troublesome Enemy is. I recognise the Old Fox\'s tricks and cunning\', etc. The \[Enemy\] got hold of Ignatius\'s mind, which had already long been actively engaged in receiving intimations of heavenly things, because he knew in advance that if Ignatius\'s teaching were to be consonant with his religious devotion it would threaten him \[the Enemy\] with a greater harm. So he tried, with this display of better doctrine, to make \[Ignatius\'s\] task of the learning the rudiments of letters ineffectual, \'at this time especially\', (as \[Giovanni\] Mattei says), \'offering his understanding frequent illuminations, and throwing light on the abstruse mysteries of Holy Scripture\'.

<div align="center"><b>The Magical Exploits of Román Ramírez</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 119-122</div>
These examples, however, are superior to teaching received from the Devil. In March in the year, 1600, in accordance with the sentence of the Inquisitors of the Faith, the bones of one Román Ramírez, together with a statue, were burned to ashes in Toledo. Ramírez had died in prison while awaiting trial. He was accused, among other things, of having received skill in medicine from an evil spirit, and since this criminal united in his person many aspects of magic, I shall not regard it as a chore to translate the \[procurator\] fiscal\'s accusation faithfully from Spanish into Latin.

\(a\) He said \[Ramírez\] had already been accused of the Muslim error and had abjured it, but added that he had relapsed-which is what that kind of muck usually does-and returned to his vomit. For many years he had kept the great fast they call \'Ramadan\', and observed the rites and ceremonies of Muhammad by first saying \'guadoc\' and \'zála, washing his whole body, putting on a clean outer garment, reciting the \'azoras\', (i.e. prayers), of that sect with his face turned to \'al-quibla\', (i.e. the rising sun), raising and lowering his head and bowing himself to the ground, extending his palms upwards to the sky while he was saying \'Alaqueur\', (i.e. God is great), and rising before daybreak to celebrate the fast \'zahor. Thus absolved \[of his sins\], he solemnly celebrated his Easter, \[called\] \'Ramadan\', for three days. This he did by abstaining from all work and manual labour, especially on the first day, by putting on a clean outer garment, and by making the declaration \'guadoc\' and \'zála\', along with many other Muslim rites and ceremonies. Then, adding crime to crime and sin to sin, he revived the overt pact and treaty he had made with an evil spirit many years before with the intention of doing something wicked. He worshipped this evil spirit, did him homage, and dedicated his soul to him on condition he assist him with his favour and advice as often as he might be needed or asked in connection with anything at all. So Ramírez asked and obtained from the evil spirit knowledge of and expertise in how to cure many secret concealed illnesses with herbs, fumigations, and superstitious incantations: and, as a matter of fact, he cured not a few people this way.

\(b\) He persuaded people he had a wide and detailed knowledge of literature, both sacred and profane, and so they would give him the titles of stories and he would-quite openly for money-recite them, more or less word for word, as though he were reading them from a book open in front of him, something he did with the help of his evil spirit. In this way he amassed not a little power because of the money he was given by his audiences, and when someone asked him how he had acquired such a reliable memory, he replied that someone very close to him, a person very knowledgeable about the properties of herbs, who had an evil spirit as a close friend, had given him some kind of drink. He also said that on one occasion, when this same person wanted to go to Saragossa, which was fifteen leagues away, he made an invocation-de bon varón, as they say-and a horse suddenly appeared. They both mounted it and very soon afterwards arrived at the city gates where they left the horse after removing its bridle. They then did the business which was the reason for their journey, returned to the gate, threw the bridle on the horse again, and were brought back home almost in an instant.

\(c\) There was an incident which took place in the town of Deza. A woman went to bed angry, (as it happened), and put herself in the hands of an evil spirit. Suddenly someone-she had no idea who-removed her from that place and because she had disappeared completely, her husband came to Ramírez and asked him for his help. Ramírez replied that the man should not be downcast, and that he would restore his wife to him. He gave him a letter and told him to go to a particular place among the vineyards, make a circle there, and stand in the middle of it, and when he heard a crowd of people passing by, even if he saw no one he was to ask, \'Where is the King going to be?\' If the answer was that the King was crossing by on that side, he should throw the letter to the ground in front of him \[self\]. The man did as he was told and got his wife back, although he did not see who had brought her back or how he had done it.

\(d\) The procurator fiscal added that \[Ramírez\] said a good many very obscure things, and things which had happened in places very far away, about which he could not have known anything at the time he was revealing them, except through his pact with an evil spirit. On one occasion, (said the fiscal), while Ramírez was leaving the house he said a traveller was about to come and ask and entreat him to come and free his daughter from an evil spirit which was obsessing her, and so they should summon him at once. The other man came and Ramírez was summoned. While he was curing the illness, Ramírez behaved in such a way that it seemed perfectly clear that an evil spirit had been dispatched against the sick woman beforehand through an act of harmful magic \[maleficio\] by Ramírez himself. \[People thought this\] because, first of all, on the day of her marriage the unfortunate girl had suffered a flux of blood together with a mental blackout and pressure round her heart; and not long afterwards she had frequent, long-lasting fainting fits, and began to hate her parents and her husband, and could not endure the sight of him or sleeping with him.

They came to the conclusion she was obsessed. A priest was sent for and for eighteen days he tried to drive away her wicked guest with exorcisms and the usual remedies of the Catholic Church. Finally, one evil spirit spoke up and said that a hundred and one evil spirits had been dispatched against the woman\'s body, but that now he was the only one because all the others had gone away. So when the priest began to repeat the usual exorcisms from the Church\'s servicebook and to urge him to say where the rest had gone, he replied they had left for the town of Deza to visit the foresaid Román Ramírez and ask him what he wanted them to do, and that they would not leave until he had given them permission to do so. At this point, the unfortunate girl was cruelly beaten to the floor and stayed there the whole day in a swoon. When the priest began to order him to stop harassing the woman and to let her live with her husband as a wife should, and to give her back a precious jewel he had stolen, \[the evil spirit\] replied that he was under Román\'s control and that he \[himself\] had the jewel but could not give it back. It was after this that the parents, affected by what the evil spirit said, had sent for Román Ramírez to cure their daughter.

The moment he entered the house, the woman began to say and do extraordinary things, crying out that she knew he had come, but did not know why he had done so. Then, as he entered her room and she saw him, she fainted, her mouth became contorted, and she remained like this for three days, unable to eat or drink, having no power to swallow anything at all. So the magician drenched her with a strong suffumigation composed of \[smoke from\] burning shoe-leather, juniper oil, and other things, summoned her back from her fainting fit and then, addressing the spirit which was obsessing her, said, \'Leave her alone. Leave her alone and go away. Flee, unless you want me to repeat the suffumigation\'.

The evil spirit, however, was unwilling to reply, so Ramírez told everyone to leave the room and, thinking no one could hear him, started to question the spirit and demand, \'Why don\'t you answer me? The spirit which attended my grandfather had more humility! What have I done that you do not deign to speak to me? Isn\'t it enough that I have devoted myself to you entirely for such a long time? So now make this woman sleep so that she doesn\'t hear anything we say\'.

Meanwhile, another evil spirit arrived, and the accused said to him, \'You\'ve come at the right moment. What did you do while you were in Deza? How are my wife and children?\'

\'Your son\', said \[the evil spirit\], \'was not well, but he\'s now out of danger. Your wife was worse. She has now recovered. Your grandson is still sick, and there is a danger he may die.

Then Ramírez replied that since they knew he had served them faithfully every day, and how much he was bound to them, they were not unaware he was being pressed for a debt of two hundred reals as payment for a garden he had rented. It was fair, \[he said\], that they do him a favour and leave the obsessed woman\'s body, at least for the space of fifteen days, and leave her healthy and sound in the meantime, so that he could receive payment of a large fee and increase his future reputation and good character, which would otherwise receive a notable blow. After that, they could attack her again, and take possession of her as far as he was concerned. The evil spirit then promised he would do this and obey him. But when Ramírez noticed his conversation had been overheard by other people, and that he had been found out as someone who had power, so to speak, over an evil spirit, he became angry and threatened he would throw \[the evil spirit\] into chains, and the memory of this would make sure he would not dare do anything like that again.

The evil spirit was expelled, but because the woman\'s parents had not paid a large enough fee for what he had done, Ramírez threatened that they would soon need his help again. Immediately, he transferred the condition \[caused by\] his harmful magic \[maleficii\] into the husband of the woman who was now free and told his evil spirits to go into him and molest him. They did so and afflicted him very cruelly for the entire day, inspiring him with a thousand frightening mental images and temptations to despair. So, they sent for \[Ramírez\] again and when he came to the man he said, \'You have been struggling valiantly with an evil spirit, my friend\', then, employing suffumigations, he drove the evil spirits out of him. He left the town, discontented with the tiny fee \[he had received\]. After he had gone, the parents discovered that not only had their daughter not been cured, but that she was growing worse day by day. So, they wrote to the magician and sent no small a sum of money along with the letter, promising a larger sum if he would cure the woman completely. He deigned to come, gave the courier the material for another fumigation, and wrote down the ritual he should use, adding that when he got back to the house, he would find her somewhat better and dancing with female friends: and that is how it turned out. But since the wife was still not willing to sleep with her husband, he suffumigated her and added the words he had been told \[to use\], namely, \'Evil spirits, leave this woman, because Román tells you \[to do so\]. Otherwise, I shall send for him, and he will come and drive you out by force, because this is what he has promised me\'. At this invocation, the woman gave a loud cry, was cured, and remained free and lived with her husband the way married couples usually do. (This comes from the court records I mentioned).

<div align="center"><b>Blessed Angela da Foligno's Torments by Evil Spirits</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 123-125</div>
But in order to make clear by means of a particular example how far an evil spirit is sometimes accustomed to go in trying to constrain the will-not with complete success, but close to it, and not in actuality, but in appearance-for the consolation of those who have been tempted I shall record the words of Blessed Angela da Foligno. In chapter 19 of her Life, she describes one of her experiences.

\'I suffer more or less continually at the hands of evil spirits torments and sufferings of the soul and, I am telling you, there are more of them, and they are and incomparably more grievous than those suffered by the body. I don\'t know how to tell you what they are like, other than to say, think of somebody suspended by a rope upon a beam, with his hands tied behind his back and his eyes blindfolded, left on the gibbet still alive, without any help, any remedy, or any support. I am saying I am tortured in a greater state of hopelessness and more cruelly by evil spirits, because I see that the evil spirits are hanging my soul in such a way that, just as the hanged man has nothing to support him, so my soul does not appear to have any support left, and all my soul\'s courage is overthrown while my soul knows \[what is happening\] and looks on. When my soul sees that all its courage is being overthrown and is leaving, and that it cannot set oppose this, there is such great pain to my soul that sometimes I can scarcely weep because of my hopeless grief and anger. Sometimes, on the other hand, I can\'t stop weeping, and sometimes such great anger comes over me that I can scarcely hold myself back from ripping myself to pieces. Sometimes I can\'t stop myself from hitting myself dreadfully, and when I do that, I have sometimes made my head and other parts of my body swell up. When my soul sees all my courage vanishing and leaving, my soul starts to lament and I cry out to my God.

I also suffer another torment-that all my defects have come alive in me again and are now beginning to gather strength, \[and I suffer\], not because during my life-time they bring my reason under their control, but because they cause and bring me great punishment. Even vices which never existed in my body enter into me and are set on fire and bring me great punishment. But they do not last, and when they die again, they bring me great consolation because I see that I have been handed over to many evil spirits who cause the vices I abhor, and which were dead, to come alive again; and \[it is\] they who add the vices which never existed. When I remember that God was afflicted and despised here \[on earth\], I should like, (in as much as it is proper), all the evil things happening to be to be doubled. Whenever I am in the utterly dreadful darkness caused by the evil spirits, when it seems that all hope of good is entirely absent, the darkness is dreadful and the vices in my body, (which I realise inwardly are dead in my soul), are being revived. Outwith my soul, however, the evil spirits are reviving them and even those vices which did not exist are being revived. I also suffer physically in at least three places, because in my shameful places there is such a great fire that it was my habit to put physical fire to them to put out the fire of lust, until my confessor told me not to.

When I am in that darkness, I believe I should more readily choose to be roasted than to suffer the things I have just been talking about. At that point, indeed, I cry aloud and call for death, \[begging\] God to allow it to come to me in any way at all. On those occasions I say to God, \'O Lord, if you must send me to Hell, please do it quickly and don\'t put it off and, since you have abandoned me, finish the job and plunge me into the deep\'. Then I realise it is the work of evil spirits and that those vices are not alive in my soul, because my soul never consents to them. My body, however, suffers violence, and there is such great pain and disgust that if it were to last, my body could not bear it. But my soul also sees that all power has been taken away from it, even though it does not consent to the vices. In spite of the fact that it does not have the power to resist the vices entirely, it also sees that it is opposed to God, and so falls and is tortured in them. There is also a particular sin which God has allowed to come into me, which never existed in me \[before\]. I recognise clearly this sin which God has allowed to come into me, and this sin is so great that it surpasses all my other sins. There is also a particular strength which God has clearly given me to counter that sin, and by this God sets me free by His special supernatural power. If I did not have a sure faith in God, the responsibility would lie with me and not with anyone else; and in that case a sure, untroubled hope in which I could have no doubt would be my responsibility. But the strength always prevails and the sin \[always\] fails, and the strength is in control of me and does not allow me to fall into sin.

The strength is so great that not only is it in control of me, it actually gives me so much of its strength that I really do recognise God in this \[situation\] and am illumined and strengthened to such a degree that I could not be moved to the smallest sin by anyone in the world, or any of the demons in Hell, or anything else; and my faith in God rests in me, along with this power. The sin, however, is so great that I am ashamed to mention it and \[to say\] that whenever the foresaid courage has been taken away from me, I also have the impression that what has abandoned me is not something which could protect me, either because of my feelings of shame or \[because it is\] a torment \[intended\] to stop me from rushing into sin straight away. But then the courage I mentioned comes over me and sets me free with its special supernatural power in such a way that I could not sin for all the good or evil in the world. These hardships I have borne for two years and more\'.

Thus far St Angela\'s translator, with insufficient Latin.

<div align="center"><b>Lapp Magician's Trance for Distant Knowledge</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 126-126</div>
This is the kind of thing Olaus Magnus tells us about Lapp magicians. If any traveller wants to find out exactly what is going on back home, they undertake that within twenty-four hours he will find out what is happening there, even if home is three hundred miles away. This is how they do it. A shaman \[incantator\] ceremonially summons his gods and then suddenly collapses and becomes unconscious as though his soul had suddenly left his body, because either he has no breath left in him, nor does any sensation, movement, or life seem to remain with him. But to make sure they are \[actually\] still there, there must always be someone with him to guard the body while it is abandoned and lying unconscious, because if this is not done evil spirits make off with it. Once twenty-four hours have elapsed, his breath comes back and the unconscious body wakes up with a groan, as from a deep sleep, as though the man who had fallen down were being called back to life from death. After he has been restored this way, he replies to questions and, to create trust in his questioner, tells him something his questioner recognises and knows for certain has taken place in his own home or in those of his relatives.

In the case of the virgin from Zaragoza-this is what I call her because her deception was finally uncovered in that city by the Archbishop in 1585-who pretended she had the stigmata of Christ, her \'raptures\'-and every one of them stemmed from a pact she had made with an evil spirit while she was feeding her sheep-were as frequent as those of Magdalena de la Cruz from Cordoba who was a notorious wise-woman \[saga\].

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 126-126</div>
This was an error of the Kabbalists, and I suspect the Platonists were not averse from it, because of a well-known story told by Plato himself. Er, the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth, had lain dead for ten days among the corpses of those slain in battle. He was brought home and afterwards, on the second day, when he should have been put on his funeral pyre, he came back to life and gave an account of some of the extraordinary things he had seen while he was among the dead.

<div align="center"><b>Clazomenae Man's Apparent Soul Journey</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 126-126</div>
There was a similar story about someone from Clazomenae in Book 3 of Origen\'s Against Celsus,

<div align="center"><b>Aristeas of Proconnesus's Repeated Revivals and Soul as Crow</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 126-127</div>
and one about Aristeas of Proconnesus which Pliny tells in \[Inquiry into Nature\] Book 7, chapter 52, and in his Life of Romulus, Plutarch, relying on Herodotus, tells us that the dead man came back to life many times and could recover his soul wherever he wanted, and that those who were standing nearby could see his soul in the shape of a crow, flying out of his mouth.

<div align="center"><b>White Weasel Emerging from Soldier's Mouth</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 127-127</div>
This man, however, was not dead, but in a magical trance, and it was not his soul which was flying out of his mouth, but a devilish conjuring-trick. The same has to be said about the white weasel which emerged from the sleeping soldier\'s mouth and went back in again, and then went back and forth across a small brook over a sword which someone had laid down. This story, told by Hélinand \[de Froidmont\], was a joke by an evil spirit who did it in order to impress on \[people\'s\] minds this error about the soul\'s migration, and to convince old women\'s fantasies and children still wet behind the ears, rather than natural philosophers.

<div align="center"><b>St Giles of Assisi on Soul Separation in Ecstasy</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 127-128</div>
I think this is how one must understand what is said about St Giles \[of Assisi\] in The Deeds of Franciscans. When he was asked whether during this life the soul sometimes left its body during an ecstasy or during contemplation, he replied that it did and that he knew a man to whom it happened; and he said it \[happened\] either because once every bodily function was removed, \[the soul\] forgot it completely, or because divine power was removed from the body and was then brought back into it. (Juan Salvador Trados tells the story in volume 1 of The Deeds and Sayings of the Illustrious Order of St Francis, p. 205).

<div align="center"><b>Burgos Virgin's Daily Raptures from Eucharist</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 128-129</div>
I know, and a thousand people still living know as well, that there was a virgin dedicated to God who was still alive in Burgos in Castile, in 1585-one of those they call \'beatas\' there. The moment she caught sight of the Eucharist and, scarcely had she received it in her mouth, than she was lifted into a rapture. This happened every day and to such an extent that she could not feel small pins applied to and driven into her feet, and because she was someone who was averse from human glory, she was in the habit of begging God, very ardently, (since she preferred to be holy rather than talked about or seen), not to let anything of this kind happen to her in front of other people; and when she came back to herself, she would hurry home as fast as possible, full of embarrassment and shamefacedness, and lock the door.

<div align="center"><b>Damme Crucifix Image Growing Hair and Beard</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 131-132</div>
So that I can pass over everything else, \[let me tell you this\]. In Damme, a town near Bruges, I once saw a very large wooden image of the crucified Saviour which had grown hair and a beard. These were shaved off every year but would grow back again. The devout considered this to be a miracle because of the frequent cures God used to confer upon the sick there, and other records of God\'s munificence were noted on a large number of tablets there until Calvinists, in their irreligious, obstinate folly, destroyed the image with fire and, as is their custom, razed the church to the ground.

<div align="center"><b>Linz Child Born with Post-Death Stigmata</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 132-132</div>
I can also quite happily class the following \[anecdote\] as a portent from God. \'While Charles of Austria was holding courts of justice in Linz\', says Pietro Bizzarri, \'a child was born to a peasant. There was nothing healthy about him at all. He lived for fourteen days, sweated for three days before his death, and sweated until he died. Immediately the stigmata began to appear on the dead child\'s hands and feet and in his side, just the way we see Christ\'s wounds depicted in paintings. A crown like a crown of thorns also made its appearance on his head, on the skull itself. When the Emperor heard this, he sent some of his people. They looked very carefully at the portent, and then gave him a detailed account of the whole thing, which made him realise that the situation was exactly as people had said it was.\' (See Bizzarri\'s Epitome of Remarkable Things in Europe, p. 302).

<div align="center"><b>The Shade of Creusa Appears to Aeneas</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 133-133</div>
Why, (unless it was because what the common people believed was also the opinion of those in the know as well), would the Phoebus of poets say of Anchises's son, 'The unhappy figure and shade of Creusa herself Appeared in front of my eyes, an image larger than the one I knew, [Aeneid 2.722-723].

<div align="center"><b>Cynthia's Post-Death Recounting</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 133-133</div>
Why, too, would the Latin Callimachus introduce Cynthia recounting such things as this after her death?

'The spirits of the dead do have a kind of existence. Death is not the end of everything, And the wan shade overcomes and escapes its pyre At night we are borne away and wander. Night sets free the shades which have been imprisoned, And Cerberus himself casts aside his padlock and goes wandering. Laws bid us return to Lethe’s fens at dawn. We are borne along, and the ferryman surveys the freight he is carrying', [Propertius, Elegies, 4.7.1-2, 89-92].

<div align="center"><b>Apuleius's Curse Involving Apparitions of the Dead</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 134-134</div>
Apuleius also says, in the first part of his Defence, Aemilianus, may the god Mercury who goes between the gods of the upper world and those of the lower grant you the ill favour of the gods of both, and always keep on casting in your way apparitions [species] of the dead, any shades [umbrarum] at any time, any spectres [lemurum], any spirits of the dead [Manium], and any goblin creatures [larvarum], and may he thrust upon your eyes all the terrors of the night, all the nightmares of the sepulchre, and all the horrors of the grave'.

<div align="center"><b>Moses Appears on Mount Tabor</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 138-139</div>
There is the suggestion that this is the way the law-giver Moses appeared along with Christ, our Lord, on the summit of Mt Tabor. I do not think [the idea] that Moses appeared in a body made of air for that occasion, as [Walafrid] Strabo and St Thomas [Aquinas] thought, is objectionable. One will be able to say that this was a genuine apparition in which Moses's real soul appeared, and one will also be accurate in saying that Moses 'appeared', because that is the preferable way of describing it. In his Care for the Dead [18], St Augustine, too, hints that he thought this apparition of Moses was not unlike that of Samuel, and no one says of Samuel that he appeared in his own body.

All the arguments brought against St Thomas [Aquinas], too, are irrelevant with the result that one cannot take the authority of the Fathers [of the Church], who use the word 'resurrection' in its broad sense, and apply it to Moses, saying that he is like someone 'rising up again' in a body he has assumed, which is an opinion to which [Cornelius] Jansen inclined in chapter 67 of his Harmony. But because in fact St Jerome, Epiphanius, and most of the Fathers use the word of a real resurrection-you have their words in [Francisco] Suárez-I shall not drag out the argument further.

I say, rather, that real resurrections have nothing to do with the subject I am discussing here, because I am talking about the appearance of the dead and Moses's [appearance] was no more going to be that of a dead man than [the appearance] of Elias, since Moses would have been alive at the time, and so would Elias. But what did a certain [author] say in The Transgressor Bound?³⁷¹ When Moses answers the evil spirit's question, 'Where have you come from, Moses?' he says, From the upper air, of course. Where I, fortunate man, was carried up with Enoch and Elias, And am awaiting God's final Day [of Judgement]'.

This must be read with caution, because if it means that Moses was carried up while he was still alive with Enoch and Elias who were not yet dead, that is undoubtedly a rash thing to say and contrary to Holy Scripture. If [it means he was carried up] with Elias and Enoch and will come at the Final Time, that is equally rash. If [it means] Enoch and Elias were carried up into the highest fiery heaven, this is clearly novel and unheard of, because anyone who has a share in that glory before death is a saint, a pilgrim who has attained his goal. More dangerous by far in the same work are Michael's and the good angels' bewailing the punishment of Lucifer and even accusing God of cruelty. Plainly that was about as valuable a thing to do as transforming Aeschylus's Prometheus into Lucifer and the Nereids into good angels! This was how daring the poet was prepared to be.

But to return to what I said about Moses: one needs to make the same answer about those who rose and appeared with the rising Lord. They, too, had returned to life and perhaps followed the Lord as He ascended into Heaven, and had no more part in death, if they merely appeared in their own body and informed it, as is very likely. Therefore, I deny that spirits [spiritus] assume their own bodies, (in order to appear in them, at any rate), and that they do so in order to inform them and give them life, because under those circumstances they are not returning in order to be what they are seen to be. They are doing so in order to furnish, by means of these [bodies] which are well-known [to others], a way in which they can be recognised, for which purpose a feigned body is perfectly adequate.

<div align="center"><b>Samuel's Apparition</b></div>

So, what, (someone may say), do you say about those people whose souls, we read, have been told to go into their body again and, indeed, some [souls] which have been sentenced to the tortures of Hell and have been released therefrom? (An example is Andreas of Rome in 1070, whose story is well worth reading and can be found in Book 1, chapter 33 of the life of St Hanno of Köln in [Laurent] Sauer, Volume 6, for 4th December.)

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 143-143</div>
There is a very wellknown story about St Augustine. While he was giving thought to his commentaries on the Trinity, a child appeared to him. The child was making a vain, useless attempt to pour the sea, regardless of how big it is, into a small ditch with a spoon.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 143-143</div>
He could not be mistaken for an angel, any more than the other [apparition] in the very old story about St Dorothea's struggle. This one was like a very pretty, delicate four-year old child and had brought delightfully blushing roses and fresh apples to Theophilus in the middle of winter, just as the virgin, boldly trusting in God, had promised, even though everything in the area was bristling with frost and shrivelled up because it was so cold.

Rufinus [of Aquileia] and St Bonaventure testify that Wisdom and Chastity presented themselves to St Gregory of Naziazenus's sight and, unless this had happened to him while he was asleep, one might suspect they were angels in female form.

<div align="center"><b>Virgin Appears to St Lorenzo Giustiniani</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 143-143</div>
St Lorenzo Giustiniani claims that a virgin, brighter than the sun, appeared to him to tell him she was God's Wisdom who had taken human form for the sake of reforming humankind, and that God had given her to him [St Lorenzo as his bride. She then gave him the kiss of peace and withdrew. His biographers say this was our Lord Jesus appearing to him in that form. I should think it was an angel rather than [Jesus], because if Christ Himself appeared in female form, why do we not believe that angels sometimes make themselves seen in that same guise?

<div align="center"><b>Angel Appears as Dove to St Gommar</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 143-144</div>
There is a life of St Gommar who is venerated by my fellow Brabantines, recorded either by Theobald or some other ancient eloquent writer, in which you can find that an angel, sent by God, presented itself to be seen in the guise of a dove glowing with a remarkable brilliance on top of his sleeve. It advised him against a pilgrimage he intended to make, and suggested he change to loftier studies and labours. The holy man obeyed, and in nothing which took place afterwards can one detect the mocking deception of an evil spirit. On the contrary, several things [happened] from which it appears that this took place on God's instructions.

(I am not unmindful that evil spirits have, in the past, misused the image of a dove which has been set apart as [a symbol of] the Holy Spirit). So I am persuaded that this apparition was that of a good angel.

<div align="center"><b>Angel Appears as Eagle to Wambert</b></div>

Another vision, conferred upon Wambert while he was awake, seems to tell us that an angel appeared to him in the form of an enormous eagle-see [Laurent] Sauer, the Life of St Bertulf, chapter 12, under 5th January-although if anyone were to argue that this was a real bird, (as it seems was the one Bishop Noger writes about in The Translation of St Laudoaldus, in Sauer, volume 2), I should not particularly object.³⁸¹

<div align="center"><b>The Apparition of Samuel to Saul</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 145-146</div>
It is proved in the time of the Old Testament because Samuel's soul appeared to Saul, not because it has been roused by the power of a magical incantation, but because it has been sent by God. This appears to be the more accurate opinion. God sent Samuel to reprove the disobedient king, threaten him with immediate punishment, and so encourage him to repent. And after this he fell asleep and showed and made known to the King the end of his life. He lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy to destroy the ungodliness of the nation.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 147-147</div>
After His resurrection, Christ our Lord came to the Apostles even though the doors were closed, something they did not think possible unless it was done by a spirit [spiritu]. They thought they were seeing a spirit and were therefore extremely disturbed and terrified. Indeed, Theophilus expressly declares that they thought it was some soul which had come back from another life. St Augustine, Eucherius, Bede, Cardinal Hugo, and many others had the same idea, but they thought it was Christ’s soul in an assumed body [made of air, not His own body, and that [the Apostles] were not yet certain He had risen again. Christ knew what they were thinking and replied that by touching His real body they could know He was not a spirit.

<div align="center"><b>Apostles See Christ Walking on Water as a Spirit</b></div>

The Apostles had had the same suspicion and fear before the Passion when they saw Him walking on water. They had been reproved on that occasion, not because they thought that ghosts [spectra] sometimes do exist, but because they thought it was not Christ who was then appearing to them.

<div align="center"><b>Rhoda Sees Peter's Apparition</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 147-147</div>
When Rhoda told the whole Church which was in Jerusalem that Peter had been freed from prison and was standing at the gate, [Acts 12.1415] they said she was mad, because they were fully persuaded that Peter was alive and being kept in prison. They knew the soul of a living person could not appear outwith his body, and so they rebuked the girl’s mistake [in thinking] it was the soul of a living person. They thought it was an angel disguised as Peter. Had they believed Peter was dead, they would have agreed with the girl.

We had the first church in Spain, perhaps in the whole of Europe, dedicated by St James, son of Zebedee, to the Mother of God, St Mary of the Pillar, near the Ebro at Zaragoza. This was reported in the annals of Celtiberia and also accepted by such a firm tradition of the church there that no Catholic in that area has any doubts about it. The tradition is that the Blessed Virgin appeared to the Apostle of Spain standing on a pillar and ordered him to dedicate a small shrine to her on that spot. It is now a rich and noble church.

and Origen himself, in Against Celsus Book 1, \[chapter 46\], testifies, \'Many have been brought to the Christian religion, more or less unwillingly, by some kind of spirit \[spiritu\] which suddenly changed their mind in such a way that, after they had been shown visions either while they were asleep or while they were awake, they would then not hesitate to go to meet death on behalf of the Word whom they had hated. I have seen many such instances, and if, in what I am writing here, I were to recount merely what they did, unbelievers would start to jeer, thinking I was making it up just like those they wrongly suspect are doing so. God, however, is witness to my conscience that I am trying to make people favourable towards Jesus\'s teaching, not by telling deceitful anecdotes, but by giving true examples.\'

Socrates, (\[History of the Church\] Book 1, chapter 8 \[12\]) and Rufinus, (\[History of the Church\] Book 1, chapter 5), say this in connection with that same Spiridion. Let me quote what Rufinus says. \'He had a daughter called Irene and when she had looked after him well, she died, a virgin. After her death, someone came along saying he had entrusted something to her keeping. Her father said he had no knowledge of this, \[but\] he searched the whole house diligently. He did not find what he was looking for anywhere, but the man who had entrusted it \[to Irene\] persisted and went on pressing the matter with wailing and tears. He kept swearing he would put an end to his life unless he recovered what he had entrusted to her. Moved by the man\'s tears, the elderly \[father\] hurried off to his daughter\'s tomb and started calling her by name. Then, from the tomb, she said, \"What do you want, Father?\" \"Where did you put what that man entrusted to you?\" he asked. She told him where it was. \"You will find it buried there\", she said. He went back home, found the object, just as his daughter had told him from the tomb in answer to his question, and handed it back to the man who had kept on asking for it\'.

Gregory of Caesarea, a priest, reported an extraordinary story. (See \[Luigi\] Lippomano, Volume 6, \'A Discourse on the Synod of Nicaea\'.) \'Two holy bishops\', he said, \'Chrysanthus and Musonius, had not yet appended their signatures to \[the Synod\'s\] decree, and it happened that, by divine providence, they departed this human life. So, the holy fathers \[of the Synod\] came to the place where \[the two bishops\] were sleeping together \[in death\], and once \[the Fathers\] were with them, \[the bishops\] heard what was being said. \"Brethren and fathers\", said \[the Synod Fathers\], \"you have fought a magnificent fight along with us, you have finished the race, you have preserved the Faith. So, if you decide that what \[the Synod\] has done is pleasing to God, (because you now perceive \[things\] in a purer way), let there be nothing to stop you from signing this decree as well\". They all said this together, put their seals on the decree, put it in the bishops\' coffin, and spent the whole of that night awake in prayer. Next day, when they came to the coffin, they found that the seals they had attached \[to the decree had been broken, and when they unrolled the holy decree, they found that the holy bishops\' signatures had been added to it\'. Nicephorus, (\[History of the Church\] Book 8, chapter 23), adds the words which had been written at the bottom. \'Chrysanthus and Musonius. We took part in the first holy ecumenical Synod \[of Nicaea\] with all the fathers, and even though we have been removed in body, we have still appended our signatures to this document in our own hand.\'

In 366 the Emperor Julian was killed by the spearhead of an unidentified individual. St Basil had a vision of this before it happened. St Mercurius appeared to him, along with the Blessed Virgin, and as \[the saint was leaving, he was carrying a bloody spear, as St \[John\] of Damascus, relying on Helladius, one of St Basil\'s disciples, reported in his Holy Images 1.

At the same time, too, someone else, while making his way to the camp, saw, either while he was awake or while he was dreaming, several of the Apostles and prophets gathered together, looking into the wrongs Julian had done to the Church and generally reflecting upon them. Two of their number urged the rest to be of good courage and left and, returning to the company not long afterwards, informed it that the tyrant had been killed. Sozomen tells this story in his \[History of the Church\] Book 6, chapter 2, but leaves out the names of the two men. Nicephorus, however, added that the two were once the famous soldiers and martyrs, Mercurius and Artemius. (See his \[History\] Book 10, chapter 35).

Herodias had ordered that St John the Baptist\'s head be buried very deep, and many centuries later the saint himself appeared to two monks while they were asleep and showed them where it was; and although the memory of that place was lost and people did not know where \[the head\] was hidden, before Marcian became Emperor St John pointed out, in an extraordinary way, to a monk, Marcellus, the spot where his head was buried.

At this, the citizens\' spirits were raised, and on the second day Stilicho arrived with his army and was victorious over the enemy.

He appeared to Mazcezel, who was despairing of his own safety and that of the army he was leading against Gildo, in a vision at night. He was holding a walking-stick in his hand and when Mazcezel prostrated himself at the saint\'s feet, the old man struck the earth with the stick he was using to help himself along, (and this was the third time he had appeared to Mazcezel in this guise), and said, \"Here, here, here!\" indicating the spot and giving then man whom he had thought worthy of this visitation to understand that he should realise he would gain victory on the third day in the very place in which he had seen the Lord\'s saintly priest. Thus, he began and ended the war, free from anxiety. (When I was appointed to Milan, I learned all this from what Mazcezel himself had said because in the see in which I now hold an appointment, \[Mazcezel\] had given an account of it to a very large number of priests, and so I thought I could quite safely add to this book what I found out earlier from them.)

I found out that a blind man arrived and said he had received his sight on the same day he touched the coffin in which the saints\' relics were being carried. In a vision at night, \[he said\], he had seen a ship approaching the coast, and in it there was a large number of men clad in white. While they were disembarking, he begged one of them to inform him who those men were and was told they were \[St\] Ambrose and his companions. When he heard that name, he prayed he might receive his sight, and the man said to him, \"Go to Milan and present yourself to my brethren who are going to come on\", (and he named the day), \"and you will receive your sight\". The \[blind\] man was from the coast of Dalmatia and kept saying he had never come to the city before until he made his way straight to the saints\' relics.

In chapter 17 of his biography of St Germain d\'Auxerre, the priest Constantinus writes, \'The holy man was staying, undaunted, in a house infested with spectres when suddenly, right in front of a man who was reading a book, there stood a dreadful ghost \[umbra\] which, little by little drew itself erect before his eyes as he looked at it. Showers of stones were being thrown at the walls, too, so the man who had been reading was absolutely terrified and begged the priest to protect him. \[The saint\] immediately jumped up, looked the dreadful figure in the face and, first invoking the name of Christ, ordered it to say who it was and what it was doing there. \[The ghost\] laid aside its frightening lack of reality at once and spoke in a humble voice, like a suppliant, \[saying\] that he and a close friend had committed many crimes and were lying unburied, and that the reason they were disturbing people was that they themselves were unable to be at peace. He asked \[the saint\] to pray to the Lord for them so that they might deserve to receive rest. This made the holy man feel sorry \[for them\] and he told \[the ghost\] to show him where they were lying. Then, carrying a taper in front of him, the ghost led the way ahead and, in the dead of night, pointed out the spot where they had been thrown out among buildings which were in a state of complete ruin. When daylight had returned to the world, \[the saint\] called together people from the neighbourhood and, giving them a good example, applied himself to the work and encouraged them to clear away the old rubbish which had been thrown hurriedly on top of \[the bodies\]. When they had pulled it off with rakes, they found the bodies spreadeagled in a disorderly fashion, their bones still bound tightly with iron \[chains\]. \[The saint\] arranged for a grave to be dug in accordance with the law; the bodies were freed from their chains and clothed in pieces of linen; soil was thrown on top of them and they were buried; a prayer of intercession was said over \[the grave\], and the dead obtained their rest. As a result, after that day the house flourished, many people came to live in it, and there was no sign of \[its former\] horror\'.

He tells a story, of which he was an eye-witness, about the delegation of Bishop John of Caesarea and Bishop Porphyrius of Gaza to \[the Emperor\] Arcadius \[seeking permission to demolish the Marneion. In this account along with everything else he describes a very severe storm which God had allowed to rise because of the heretical wickedness of a ship\'s captain. \'We began to call upon \[him, using\] the prayers of St Procopius the Hermit, and when evening had come and the storm had not abated, we remained awake the whole night. Round about morning, however, after a great deal of suffering, the very holy bishops slept a little and, during sleep, my lord Porphyrius saw St Procopius the Hermit who spoke to them. \"Teach the ship\'s captain the catechism\", he said, \"seal him again-because he is a member of Arius\'s hateful sect-make sure he curses Arius and his wicked faith, and this great storm will abate at once\".

<div align="center"><b>Dead Evagrius Appears with Signed Bond to Synesius</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 156-157</div>
But an anecdote about Synesius, Bishop of Cyrene, and Evagrius the Philosopher, which Sophronius wrote, (relying on Leontius), in his Spiritual Meadow, chapter 195 is perfectly trustworthy. Synesius was constantly trying to convert \[Evagrius\] to the Christian religion, and \[Evagrius\] kept on objecting to Christian teaching on the resurrection of the body, the reward for good works, especially the hundredfold return after this life for one\'s almsgiving, and used to say he could not but think this was a fairy-tale. But in the end the Bishop, who spared no pains \[to convert him\], persuaded him to become a Christian and baptised him along with his children. \'Not long after he had been baptised, he gave the Bishop three hundred gold pieces to be used for the benefit of the poor, saying, \"Take this gold, distribute it to the poor, and write me a bond in your own hand, saying that Christ will honour it in the next life\". \[Synesius\] took the gold and readily wrote the bond, as Evagrius had asked. The philosopher lived for several years after his baptism, but at length he became mortally ill, and when he was near death he said to his sons, \"When you are making the arrangements for my funeral, put this document in my hands and bury it with me\". After his death, his sons did as he had instructed and buried him with the handwritten bond. On the third day after the burial, he appeared to Bishop Synesius while he was sleeping at night, and said, \"Come to the tomb where I am lying and take your bond, because I have received what I was owed and have had satisfaction; and so that you can be assured of this, I have signed it in my own hand\". Now, the Bishop did not know the bond had been buried with him, but next morning he summoned Evagrius\'s sons and said, \"Tell me, did you put anything in the tomb with your father?\" Thinking he was asking about money, they said, \"Nothing, my lord, except the usual grave clothes. Why do you ask?\" \"Did you, by any chance, bury a document with him?\" The sons still did not know he was talking about a bond but, after thinking about it, said, \"Oh yes, my lord, when he was dying, he did give us some kind of document and said, \"When you bury me, put this document in my hands, but no one is to know about it\". Then the Bishop told them the dream he had had that night and took them, along with some clerics and some of the most important of the citizens, to the philosopher\'s tomb. They opened it and found the philosopher lying there, holding in his hands the bond in the Bishop\'s handwriting. They took the bond from his hands, opened it, and found that the following had recently been added to it in the philosopher\'s handwriting. \"I, Evagrius, a philosopher, greet you, most holy Synesius, my lord Bishop. I have received what I was owed according to what you wrote in your own hand in this paper, have been given satisfaction, and have no further claim against you for the gold I have you and, through you, to Christ, our God and Saviour\", etc.

St Gamaliel, St Paul\'s teacher, appeared three times on different nights to Lucianus, a holy man and a priest, who was half awake at the time. (\[This happened\] not during the reign of Constantine-Nicetas makes this mistake in his oration on the martyrdom and discovery of St Stephen-but during that of Honorius and Archidius). He pointed out to him where the relics of his body were, and those of St Stephen, the first martyr, St Nicodemus, and St Abibus. They were found there and brought to the west by Orosius.

He said that a church in Rome had a written document which said that when \[Leo\] had written a letter to Flavianus, the holy Bishop of Constantinople, against the irreligious Eutyches and Nestorius, he placed it on top of the grave of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, and then spent time in prayer and vigils and fasts. He begged the chief of the Apostles, \"If, because I am simply a human being, I have written something here I should not have done, \[I ask\] you, to whom our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has entrusted both the Church and this See, to put it right\". After four days the Apostle appeared to him and said, \"I have read it and corrected it\". \[Then Leo\] picked up the letter from St Peter\'s tomb, opened it, and found that the Apostle had corrected it in his own hand.

He said to me, \"Tell Pope Eulogius I have come\". I said to him, \"Who is it who is telling me to make this announcement?\" He replied, \"I am Leo, the Roman Pontiff\". So, I went in and announced, \"The very holy and blessed Pope Leo, Bishop of the See of Rome, wants to meet you\". When he heard this, Pope Eulogius rose from his seat and ran quickly to meet him. They greeted one another, said a prayer, and then sat down. The distinguished lord Leo said to holy Eulogius, \"Do you know why I have come here to you?\" \"No\", replied Eulogius. \"I have come\", said Leo, \"to thank you for your splendidly correct and proper reply to the letter I sent my brother Flavianus, the Patriarch of Constantinople. You explained my meaning and intention and shut the mouths of the heretics.

Musa wanted to join their company but did not dare do so. The voice of the blessed Virgin Mary asked if she wanted to be with them and live in her service. The girl said, "I do", and immediately received an instruction not to behave in a light-minded and girlish fashion and to refrain from laughing and joking, knowing full well that in thirty days' time she would be entering [the Virgin's] service along with the virgins she had seen.

After seeing this [vision], the girl changed her behaviour entirely and wiped away her girlish light-mindedness with the heavy hand of seriousness. Her parents were astonished at the change in her and when they asked her about it, she told them what the blessed Mother of God had instructed her to do, and on which day she told her she would be entering her service.

But if you want to help me, offer this bread to Almighty God on my behalf and intercede [for me] on account of my sins. You will know He has heard you when you come here to wash and don't find me at all." With these words he vanished and he, who was a spirit,' etc.

St Leocadia rose from her grave and appeared to him and the King and the whole clergy and people and seemed to be holding out a large cloth in her hand. In order to test whether this apparition was genuine, the King handed St Ildephonsus a knife and [Ildephonsus] cut off some of the cloth. (This piece of cloth, along with the knife, has been deposited among the treasures of the Church). Julianus Pomerius, a bishop of the same church, testifies to both [stories].

<div align="center"><b>Translation of St Euphemia's Relics</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 162-163</div>
What Bishop Constantine says is entirely worthy of astonishment. He was an eyewitness of the translation of the relics of St Euphemia the Martyr, (see [Luigi] Lippomano, Volume 6). Blinded by the splendour of her miracles, Leo Isauricus secretly removed the martyr's relics and put dry bones in their place, and threw the genuine relics, along with their reliquary, into the sea waves. Some sailors came upon the reliquary but did not know what it was and, thinking some kind of treasure had been put in it, they took it and opened it and, drenched in the sweet scent which breathed miraculously from it, realised these were holy relics, and although they remained ignorant of whose [relics] they were, that same night they saw lights and candles and men shining wonderfully white and praising God.

'When they landed in Levinum and had gone to sleep, during their repose they saw the martyr Glyceria meet the virgin Euphemia, embrace her, exchange a kiss with her, and congratulate her on her arrival. Then they realised whose the relics were. Three times they set sail from Levinum, and three times they were driven back by contrary winds. Finally, Euphemia stood in front of them in their dreams and told them who she was. She said she wanted to stay there because of what had happened to her after she had been thrown into the sea by the irreligious Leo.'

A little later Zonaras writes of Leo the Armenian as follows. 'These things disturbed the Emperor and a dream his mother had also frightened him. She thought she was in the Church of the Mother of God in Blachernia and saw a lady accompanied by young people who were wearing white garments. The floor of the church was awash with blood, and she heard the lady giving instructions that a dish filled with that blood was to be given to the Emperor's mother. When the Emperor's mother objected, the lady said, "But your son fills those who venerate me with blood and does not realise that he is moving God and my Son to anger". (These words make it clear that the lady was the Blessed Virgin.)

In that year Ramirez, King of Spain, fought very bravely for a whole day with a very large number of Saracens and then, under cover of night, retreated with a tiny band of his own men to a particular hill. While the King was staying awake and praying to God, the saint stood near him and told everyone to cleanse themselves by confession and receive the eucharist, and they would win the battle. In the morning everyone to a man complied with the saint's instructions, and then they picked up the standards and cut sixty thousand of the enemy to pieces. The Apostle was seen mounted on a white horse during this battle, waving a white flag with a distinctive transverse red cross on it.

He was being dropped into the deep [water] and immediately hauled out again with ropes by two jet-black spirits [spiritibus]. The child asked him why this was happening, and he replied, 'Because I stole a golden chalice from St Benedict's monastery and failed to put it back [before] I was in the throes of death'. Chapter 84 [says] a hermit saw Aethiopians, who said they were evil spirits, laden with straw and preparing a pyre for that same Pandulf: and it was found he had died at that very hour.

<div align="center"><b>Elderly Ecclesiastic's Bier Moves</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 167-167</div>
I shall add at least some of the more notable examples from these last centuries, because my opponents make little of more recent [examples]. First, therefore-and I cannot be sure of the century-I shall relate here what Glykas [says] in part 4 of his Annals. 'In the history of the Church by the historian Philo, one finds that at a particular moment during the ancient persecutions, a bishop banned a rather elderly ecclesiastic from [holding] church services. But when that elderly man went elsewhere to do something he had to do, it happened he was seized by natives and gave witness in his own person to the truth. In consequence, a church was founded on the spot and the ceremonies of consecration carried out. When the Bishop started to pronounce the words, "Peace be to everyone", the bier went out the church, and this happened not once, but two or three times. From there the elderly man addressed the Bishop from the sleep [of death]. "I'm going", he said, "but please intercede for me with my bishop [and ask] him to come here and release me from my bonds, because he excluded me from my sacred office and so I can't be present with you at religious services. I have obtained the crown of my witnessing, but I have not yet seen God's face. But if [the Bishop] comes here and does not release me, no one else will be able to do so". Accordingly, when [his Bishop] complied with these [requests], the bier ceased leaving the church.'

<div align="center"><b>Udo Bishop of Magdeburg's Judgment</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 167-168</div>
This is an appropriate place to record the revenge taken by divine providence upon a wicked bishop. It happened during the tenth century but was omitted from my earlier account. 'When Udo, Bishop of Magdeburg, was not moved even by signs and prophetic voices to refrain from lewd behaviour, the clergy asked God either to amend or to remove him. One of their number, Canon Frederik, was praying after this fashion in the Cathedral of St Maurice at night, when he noticed that all the lights in the church were extinguished by a rather strong gust of wind, and not long afterwards that two youths carrying two candelabra with lighted candles came in, followed closely by Christ, His mother, and the Apostles. They summoned the holy people whose bodies were lying at rest in the church, and [St] Maurice was seen to come along with them. In a long, serious speech he laid an accusation against Bishop Udo and not long after that Christ ordered the two [youths] to fetch him, stripped of his clothes. He passed sentence against him, but the bishop put up a fight and one of the two who were bringing him struck him a violent blow in the midst of his kidneys, [whereupon], into a chalice which had been placed on the altar, the Bishop vomited up the Host of Christ which he had taken in communion the previous day. Then Udo was struck down by an axe and the vision and everyone in it vanished. Frederik was therefore absolutely terrified when he went up to the altar, looked in the chalice, [and saw] that it contained the Host of Christ and that the Bishop was lying dead on the ground. He woke the other clergy and they removed the Bishop's body and buried it in a field'.

<div align="center"><b>Galeazzo Sforza's Spirit Warns Merchants</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 168-168</div>
'Two wealthy merchants who came from not undistinguished families were making their way to France via the Mont Genèvre Pass when they met a man of larger than human appearance and received an instruction from him which went as follows. "Speak to my brother Lodovico Sforza and give him this letter on my behalf". They were rendered speechless and wondered who he was. He told them he was Galeazzo Sforza, and not long afterwards vanished from their eyes. They hastily returned to Milan and from there went to Vigevano where [Ludovico] 'The Moor' was staying and delivered the Duke's letter whose contents were as follows.

"Oh, oh, oh, Ludovico! Watch out! The Venetians and the French are about to come and destroy you and overthrow your House, but if you give me three thousand gold pieces, I shall help you to mollify the spirits [spiritibus] and get them to avert your hapless fate: and I promise this will be the result, provided you agree and don't oppose me. Goodbye", signed, "The spirit of your brother, Galeazzo".

Some people may laugh at this as an invention, but not long afterwards the prince was ejected from his principality by Louis XII, King of France, and taken into captivity'.

'Not long after he died,' (says [Marc Antonio] Sabellico), 'Lodovico's father, the lord of Imola, appeared to a secretary who was being sent to Ferrara by his son, Lodovico. [He appeared] while the man was on his way and told him to tell his son to meet him there the next day because he had something of great importance to say to him. When Lodovico heard this, he sent someone else in his place because he did not believe it and because he was afraid it was a trap. The same ghost [umbra] who had appeared before met the man and was deeply pained that his son had not come, because he said he had a good many things to tell him. On this occasion, however, he wanted to say just this-that after twenty-two years and one month had passed, (and he added a specific day), Lodovico would lose the control of the city which he now enjoyed; and when the time predicted by the ghost arrived, even though great care had been taken on the very night his father's spirit [manes] had cast suspicion, the confederate army of Duke Filippo of Milan got as far as the walls, since most of the ditches were frozen solid, set up ladders, and captured the city along with its prince,'

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 168-169</div>
In Book 1 of his History [of Italy], Francesco Guicciardini says that a rumour spread around that the spirit of Ferdinand, King of Naples, appeared on three different nights to Jacopo, a surgeon [in the household] of his son King Alfonso, and ordered him, in mild and gentle language at first, but later with threats and reproaches, to tell Alfonso, in the words he was actually using, that there was no reason for him to flatter himself with the worthless hope that he could keep French power in check, because it had been decided and determined by the law of Fate that the House of Aragon was to be shaken by an endless number of misfortunes and, in the end, deprived of its kingdom.

Guicciardini, however, does add, 'One is, however, at liberty not to disparage such things entirely', and he added it, not in relation to the apparition, but to the trustworthiness of the prediction. He was quite right to do so, because we see it was not true.

Not long afterwards, Girolamo told people about this in one of his public addresses and commended Pico to everyone's prayers.

<div align="center"><b>Marsilio Ficino Appears to Michele Mercati</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 169-169</div>
Cesare Baronio testifies of the elder Michele Mercati that Michele and Marsilio [Ficino] were very close friends because they were deeply interested in the same things and were closely bound together by [their belonging to] the School of Plato. One day, however, it happened 'that as usual [they were discussing] Plato's opinion on which part of a human being survives after death and, not without consternation, they came to the conclusion that [his arguments] were unstable and needed to be propped up by the mysteries of the Christian faith. (A learned letter from Marsilio to Michele Mercati about the immortality of the spirit and God, [with a reference] to this deduction still exists).

But when they had argued their differences for quite a long time, they brought their discussion to an end and closed it by agreeing to make a pact that whichever one of them should die first would, if he were permitted, tell the other about his state in the next life. Having made this agreement, they both swore their oath and then went their separate ways. After only a brief lapse of time it happened that Michele the elder was engaged in philosophical studies in the middle of the morning when he suddenly began to hear the racket made by a horse galloping at speed. It stopped at his door and Marsilio's voice cried out, "Michele, Michele, it's true, it's true!" Surprised by his friend Marsilio's voive, Michele got up, opened the window, and saw the man he had heard riding away again, mounted on a white horse. He shouted after the white figure, calling him by name, "Marsilio, Marsilio!" and pursuing him with his eyes. But he vanished from them.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 169-170</div>
[But] I do include one [example of an apparition] which one can rely on because of the evidence of many perfectly serious soldiers who solemnly swore they had seen it. Some years ago, when Alessandro Farnese was conducting his remarkable siege of Antwerp, in order to help the besieged the Dutch and English made a sally, and so did the besieged at the same time with a view to keeping the enemy occupied. They fought very fiercely, seized, and took possession of the royal army's earthwork, and appeared to be free from danger. At that moment, the more distinguished of the King's soldiers started to see Pedro de Paz near the earth-work-a Spanish commander and a man very much praised for his military qualities and the attention to duty which marked him out. He had died a few months earlier and on this occasion was seen fully armed as he used to be when leading his regiment. He signalled to his former soldiers and gave them the order to follow him. The front rank pointed him out to the second, the second to the third, and the third to those behind them. They all saw the same thing and, full of astonishment, plucked up their spirits and followed the leader they knew so well. He went in front of them and led them straight towards the enemy, and the fighting started. The Dutch, however, were driven back to their ships, leaving the earthwork to the King's troops, and at that moment the town, which was very well fortified, lost its hope of victory and of defending itself.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 170-170</div>
A quite dreadful thing to read is something which happened in Pavia earlier this year (1601) in April, in the diocese of a small town called Corretto. A notary's funeral was taking place in the church, when suddenly the corpse raised himself from his bier, turned to one of his relatives who was attending the funeral, and told him to hurry to his house, and to take a number of [hand-]written documents which were there and put them straight back in a holy place. Because he had concealed them, the dead man [said], God had justly sentenced him to the torments of Hell, having said which, he laid his head down as before. God permitted this so that mortals might realise what serious penalties await treacherous clerks of this kind who embezzle the legacies of people who are devout.

<div align="center"><b>Katarina's Damnation and Hauntings</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 170-172</div>
I shall also write down a second anecdote, one worthier of being remembered, about an apparition [spectri]-I do not know whether it was of an evil spirit or a damned soul-which I did not recall I had read. I hope the pleasure and use [the reader will gain] from reading it will overcome its length. It has been taken from a letter from Peru, dated 1590, and is told in the actual words either of Francesco Benci or Gaspar Spitilli.

'An extraordinary thing, well worthy thinking about, happened to this same Fr Samaniego during the mission', (the one to Itata), 'and the inhabitants of the city where it took place have known nothing like the one which has happened to him. It is confirmed by so many testimonies, too, that there is no room left for doubt. It was experienced by people who saw it with their own eyes and heard it. This event, unfortunate in its outcome, was allowed [to happen] -and one can believe this about similar things which people have confessed have happenedso that a population newly converted could learn that the sacrament of penance, in which one finds it difficult [to confess] sins which are not inconsiderable, must be treated with good faith and integrity. Consequently, the Indian woman who, everyone could see, was violating the strict rule that confession must be complete, was punished and chastised in sight of everyone, so that the salvation of many souls could be procured by the downfall of one. What happened was this.

In the house of a distinguished lady of this locality lived a young girl aged about sixteen, who had been captured during war and baptised. She was called Katarina. As she grew older, so did her lack of self-restraint and dissolute behaviour, even though she was not infrequently rebuked and punished by her mistress. The girl came to such a pitch of wickedness that she began secretly to frequent [the company of certain profligate individuals. Yet she did not fail to go to confession, although she kept her mouth shut about this sin in case people would think she was a little tart, or someone whose morals were past recovery. On 1st August 1590 she fell ill and sent for a priest, to whom she laid bare her soul's offences. She did not do so entirely, however. The priest came and went nine times during her illness, but she would laugh scornfully [and say] something like this to the other servants who were there. "That other sort of thing I was doing-it wasn't what I'd confess as one of my sins", and she used such shameful, disgraceful language as she said it that all the other servants were offended and reported it, word for word, to their mistress. She quite rightly shouted at Katarina, but then changed her expression and tone and asked in a friendly way what were those [sins] she was unwilling to confess to the Father. Katarina had no problem in telling her, and said that every time she sent for the Father during her illness so that she could cleanse herself in confession, someone looking like an Aethiopian stood on her left and kept telling her not to confess because those [particular] sins were very slight and of no importance, and if she confessed them the Father would be able to think she was more dissolute [than she was]. But on her right St Mary Magdalene appeared and urged her to purge herself frankly of whatever it was.

The Father came again, and the lady acquainted him with everything that had happened, and he tried in every possible way to get her to make a full atonement for [the benefit of her soul. He did so, however, in vain. The more he exhorted, the more stubborn she became-to the extent that she was unwilling to pronounce the word "Jesus". On another occasion, too, they offered her a holy picture of the crucifixion so that she could contemplate it and reflect that Christ was nailed to the cross and died on the cross for us. But with the greatest disdain and emotional agitation she replied, "I already know that. What do you want me to do about it?" Her mistress said to her, "We want you to turn to Christ so that if you acknowledge [the sins you have committed, He can forgive them". Katarina answered, "Please stop bothering me", and when her mistress had gone away, she started to talk in a sing-song voice about her loves and her shameful behaviour. She kept this up for several days, [talking about] the things she did and said, until one night her mistress came along with [some of the female servants, and Katarina burst out, "I'm on the rack and in agony because I have profaned confession; and from that very moment until midnight her whole body became stiff.

They thought she had died and began to think about digging her grave and giving her a funeral. But she came to, and the priest was sent for. She, however, made no change at all from the way she had usually spoken before. Three hours later, not long before she died, the servants urged her to take a cross and a holy candle in her hand and invoke the name of Jesus. But she replied, "Who is that Jesus? I don't know the name of Jesus", and she turned back to the end of the bed, sat on it, and was heard having a conversation with someone they could not see. Another female servant who was lying sick in the same room earnestly begged her mistress to have her moved to another bedroom because, she said, she could see a number of black hobgoblins [larvas] and she was absolutely terrified of them. On the night Katarina died, the whole house was pervaded by such a foetid stench of corruption that the corpse had to be put in a place open to the air.

The lady's brother was dragged out of bed by his arm; a female servant was hit on the shoulder by a small stone and carried the marks of her injury for several days; stones rained against a wall, and a horse which in other respects was perfectly tame ran hither and thither and went mad all night long; and dogs did the same, running about and barking. After the body had been buried, one of the female servants went into the room in which Katarina had lain ill, and even though she saw no one, she had the experience of having a dish, which had been put on the wooden floor, being thrown at her. The greater part of the town saw a very large number of slates and roof-tiles hurled about, with a great deal of crashing and noise, up to a distance of two miles-although there is not any slate or roof-tile on the big house because, for the most part, all this city's buildings are roofed with palm leaf. Another female slave was dragged by the foot a very long way while many people looked on, and yet they could not see who was dragging her.

On 7th October, when a female servant went into the wardrobe to fetch a dress for herself, she saw Katarina slowly rising to her feet to seize hold of a plate, and when she ran away, Katarina threw the plate at the wall so violently that it broke into a thousand pieces. Next day a paper crucifix was pinned to the wardrobe, but it was torn down from the wall in front of everyone's eyes and ripped into three pieces. On the same day, while the lady was having her dinner in the garden, a slate was thrown into the middle of her plate, all the food fell on the ground, and her four-year old son started shouting, "Mummy, Mummy! Katarina's strangling me!" They hung holy relics round his neck and he was free from that torment. These [events] forced the lady to change house, and she took herself off to her cousin's house, leaving her own house in the charge of some of her female servants. On the tenth of that month, one of the servants went into the housekeeper's room and felt herself being called three times by Katarina.

She went to pieces in an excess of fear, and the rest of the female staff urged her to call upon our Lord for help and to go back into the room with a lighted holy candle. She chose two of the women who seemed to be bolder than the rest and went back, feeling secure. But the dead woman told her to send the other women away, get rid of the candle, because it was causing her pain, and stay there alone. Katarina then started to discharge flames, along with an unbelievable stench, from every joint in her body. She was burning from head to foot and had a band of fire, as it were, round her, eight or ten fingers wide, which extended right down to the ground. At the sight of this apparition, the servant began to tremble and turn white, and the unfortunate dead woman said to her, "Come here! How many times have I summoned you!" Almost half-dead [with fear], the servant replied, "Holy Jesus, who would not be terrified at the sight of you?" The moment she said this, there came down into that place a very beautiful child, dressed in white, who urged the servingwoman to lay aside her fear, take courage, and note carefully what Katarina was [going to] say to her, so that she could tell other people and atone for all her sins by [going to] confession as soon as she left that place.

Then Katarina spoke as follows. "Please be aware that I have been delivered up to Hell and subjected to the heaviest of punishments because when I went to the priest to confess my sins, I told him only those which were not very serious-that I was a chatter-box and talkative, prone to anger, and other things of that kindbut I said absolutely nothing about my wanton behaviour and my habitual sex with young men. Learn, then, to make a good confession and not keep silent about anything you have done wrong. I am impressing this on you because I have been commanded to do so, and I am forced to be frank about this as an example to others."

Then they heard the bell ringing for the Angelus and the dead woman quickly drew back into a corner [of the room] and vanished. But the angel-because the serving-woman was convinced the child she had seen was an angel-told her to go away home, and that is what she did.'

I decided to leave this well-attested anecdote till last because of kinds of apparition come into it: angels, St Mary Magdalene, an evil spirit looking like an 'Aithiopian', and a damned soul in an assumed body-not, I think, its own, but one made of air in the likeness of its own body.

As evidence of his torture, he pressed his hand on a thick wooden table and made a very deep burn-mark on it. I have been told by eye-witnesses that the scorch-mark of a hand still exists on the table and, as a perpetual reminder of what happened, has been covered with a small piece of iron lattice-work. (Father Antonio of Siena writes in his history of the Dominicans that one can have no doubts about this incident at all).

He gives the example of drunks about whom St Ambrose gives a very good account. \'This is why meaningless images come to drunks, whose sight is untrustworthy and unsteady. They often jump over shadows as though these were little pits; the ground shakes, along with their face, and seems to rear itself up and lean away from them, and thinking it is whirling around them, they rush straight ahead in fear and clutch at the earth with their hand-or they think mountains are racing together and imprisoning them. They suffer from a roaring in their ears like the crashing of sea waves and the thunder of the surf on the sea-shore. If they see dogs, they think they are lions and take to their heels. Some dissolve into confused laughter; others wail in inconsolable grief, and others see things which make them irrationally afraid; and they dream while they are awake and quarrel while they are asleep.

This man was restored to health by his kinsfolk\'s help and care. But when his sickness and its bile had been driven out of him by a strong dose of hellebore And he came to himself again, he said, \"Oh dear, oh dear, my friends, you have killed me, Not saved me, because you have taken away a pleasure, And removed by force a delusion of my mind which gave me much delight,\" [Epistles 2.2.vv.129-140].

<div align="center"><b>The Trireme House in Agrigentum</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 182-183</div>
But let us return to imaginary apparitions. I don\'t know of anything which has happened less frequently than an incident related by Timaeus of Locri. \'There was a house in Agrigentum which was called \"The Trireme\" because of the following incident. Some young men\', (from Tauromenium), \'were attending a drinks party there. They started to become somewhat merry and, as usually happens not long afterwards, when they had become well and truly flushed, they were at such mental cross-purposes and so beside themselves that they thought they had been deposited in a trireme, and that a dreadful storm was tossing them on a sea full of swelling and plunging waves. So, as though they were afraid that the ship would be wrecked because the things in the house were being thrown around, in order to lessen [the effects of that shipwreck, they started to throw all the plates and anything else they came across in the fuddled state, into the road, or \"sea\", and people ran from all over the place to plunder what had been thrown away. The next day, when they came before magistrates who charged them with what they had done, they replied, (because they had not had enough sleep), that the fear of death had made them prefer to destroy what was in the ship rather than be devoured, themselves, by the waves. Everyone was amazed at their stupidity, and one of their number who seemed to be somewhat older, said, \"Sons of Neptune, I was so afraid, I threw myself under the beds and lay down in the bottom [of the boat]\". Since they were seen to be even more out of their wits, they were dismissed by the examining magistrate, who quite seriously impressed upon them that they should be wary of any other brutish invitation of this kind. They, however, pretending to thank him, said, \"If we are preserved from such stormy waves and make our way back to harbour, we shall raise statues to you in our own country as our saviours, along with [those] of other gods of the sea, Sons of Neptune\". (Thus Caelius Rhodiginus, deriving [the story] from Athenaeus.)

\'This evil, says St Augustine, \'which comes from the Devil, creeps through every entrance of the senses, gives itself to shapes, adapts itself to colours, adheres to sounds, underlies smells, pours itself in by means of flavours, and fills all the pathways of understanding with little clouds. Sometimes it tortures cruelly with grief and fear; sometimes it distracts by means of jokes, or mocks by means of stageplays,\' [Book of Eighty-Three Questions].

<div align="center"><b>The Evil Spirits Disturbing the Loreto College</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 184-185</div>
I can confirm this, because it actually happened at the start of my own Society, when a college was founded by Fr. Ignatius [Loyola] in Loreto. Its rector-in charge was Fr. Olivier Manare, who was still with us at the time, and who gave me an absolutely accurate account of it, which I shall add now. In 1555 malicious spirits [spiritus] were disturbing first one place, then another with loud crashing and banging, causing a remarkable amount of trouble, and depriving a very large number [of brethren] of their rest, among whom several were novices in the religious life. They also used to appear in broad daylight in different shapes. An evil spirit appeared to one brother in the form of an 'Aithiopian' with many enticing and persuasive words to make him leave the religious life. But when he saw that his effort was in vain, he went away, accompanied by very heavy breathing and a foul stench which lasted the whole day.

He manifested himself to another brother in the likeness of St Paul and began to urge him to a devout reading and study of his Epistles so that, on this specious pretext, he could draw him away from his attention to his liberal studies and thus push him into disobedience and out of the religious community-which he was successful in doing. He met Olivier [Manare] himself, in the shape of a very large black Molossian hound, jumped up at him and nearly threw him to the ground. He would thrust and push in the form of a mewing cat against the bench on which brethren were resting while they prayed, and rub up against them more than once, in order to divert or destroy their concentration.

There was no peace while the brethren were asleep, and meal-times were not allowed to pass without disturbance. Those who were resting would repeatedly feel little cats climbing on to the bed and getting under the covers, and this filled many brethren with fear and would deprive them of sleep and make them get out from under their blankets. While he was having breakfast, one brother was struck so hard on his side by the fist of an unseen assailant that he turned very pale at once, and almost fell backwards off his bench.

This molestation of his flock caused the rector a lot of annoyance. He tried [those of] the Church's remedies which would meet the case-Masses, prayers, exorcisms, holy water, holy relics, and other such things. But God did not want the evil to be removed entirely by these. Therefore, Olivier had recourse to the father they all had in common, St Ignatius, and asked for his prayers and help in this molestation. Because he was clearly depressed, Ignatius wrote him a letter, exhorting him to patience and urging him to use those remedies the Church usually employs in similar situations. 'We have already looked to these and tried them all', said Olivier in a letter, 'but the evil is still with us and is becoming worse'.

When he received this letter, Fr. Ignatius replied, 'Put your trust in the Lord, and in His goodness. He will set you free, and I shall pray earnestly for you.' When he received this letter, the rector read it to a circle of Fathers and brethren who by chance had gathered together at the time and, (marvellous to relate), that infestation of apparitions and phantasms instantly stopped, with the result that nothing of the kind was heard or seen again afterwards in Loreto. From a letter written later, we are left in no doubt that the best of Fathers began to pray for his sons and kept on praying as long as letters were carried from Rome to Loreto.

<div align="center"><b>The Deacon Gerontius and She with Asses' Legs</b></div>

Sozomen tells us in his [History of the Church] Book 8, chapter 6, where he mentions Gerontius, the deacon, who was punished by St Ambrose and discharged from his service by Nectarius because he kept on insisting he had got hold of 'She with asses' legs' at night by her shaved head and thrown her into a mill. The holy men thought, not without good reason, that this meant he had been trafficking with the demon 'She with asses' legs', although they did not condemn him for maintaining his belief in evil spirits of this name. This is how one should interpret what Nectarius and Ambrose did.

<div align="center"><b>The Dancing Troops of Subterranean Spirits</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Page 189</div>
\'Sometimes at night, adds \[Trithemius\], \'troops of them come out from the mountains and lead wonderful, amazing dances on the plains \[below\] and, as though they are in fear of their single leader, at his signal they suddenly vanish and return to their lurking places.

Occasionally one hears the sound of little bells in the midst of them, and sometimes they pretend they are the spirits of dead human beings.\' Pliny tells a memorable story about their dances and the different sound \[they make\] on Mt Atlas, (Inquiry into Nature Book 5, chapter 1.) So does Solinus, The Wonders of the World, chapter 37. He calls these evil spirits \'Aegipanes\', and Saxo the Grammarian describes the dance and gives the names of every kind of evil spirit in Book 1 of his history of Denmark.

\'The savage troop of dancing ghosts is carried forward and runs to and fro along the wind, And makes harsh noises in the direction of the stars. Fauns come together with satyrs, and a body of Pans Mingled with spirits of the dead fights with a wild look on their faces. Swarthy \[spirits\]⁴⁷⁸ come together with those who dwell in forests, and hobgoblins who do harm Are eager to share the stony footpath with vampire witches. Furies leap forward and the hobgoblins crowd together with them; And a prophetess, together with sub-nosed \[spirits\], jostles them\'.

<div align="center"><b>The Necromancer's Encounter with the Sybil of Nursus</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 190-191</div>
In his book, The Hatred of Satan, discourse 6, \[Crespet\] refers to a Domenico Mirabelli from Arpino. He, along with his step-mother, Marguerite Garnier and other accomplices, was arrested in Mantes la Jolie in France and brought to Paris, along with books on magic which they were taking to be consecrated by the presiding sybils of magic.

This Domenico confessed in court that an associate of his, known as \'the Scotsman\', who had lived in France for a long time, had the reputation of being a necromancer and had carried out remarkable trials of his skill in front of various princes. Quite a few of them had become his students, \[although\] he had taught them nothing worthwhile. This Scotsman had made his way to and met the famous Sybil who, people said, lived in the Cave of Nursus in Italy. He reported that she was a tiny woman who sat on a low stool, and that her hair was loose and hung down to the ground. She gave him a consecrated book and an evil spirit enclosed in a ring to wear on his finger. The book and the evil spirit could be made to work anywhere he might wish, as long as an adverse wind was not blowing on him as he was about to go there. (Do laugh, Reader! The wind is stronger than the evil spirit? Do laugh, too, at the following pieces of fiction regarding magic).

He also said that the supreme Pontiff had placed guards who guard the cave with the utmost care so that no one can take himself off, go there, and consult the sibyl, and that no one can reach her except those who have been initiated into magic and know how to make themselves invisible. This is because when anyone is speaking with her, whether he is a magician or not, dreadful storms and lightning-flashes disturb the whole surrounding countryside.

This is what \[Marco\] Stellato meant to imply in these verses from Book 2:

\'Either the gods of the air or the stars send these winds. Indeed, often when a magician wants to remove Treasure which is lying hidden in the earth, Or to consecrate a book, Or to bring any deity under his control by means of a magic ritual, I have been told he raises a wind and a sudden storm\'.

(Crespet adds that these Sibyls willingly guard flocks of sheep and live among cattle. This is not the reason. It is because shepherds and herdsmen are usually rather simple-minded and somewhat dull-witted, and have plenty of time on their hands, and so are more exposed to being ambushed by these evil spirits.)

In the salt-pits of Peru, behind the River Consata, an apparition of gigantic size appeared to the Indians. Its stomach had been cut open and it had been disembowelled. It was carrying two small children in its arms, made dire threats, and then vanished. The ignorant people made light of it because it appeared while the sun was shining, but a dreadful, fatal plague followed its threats, as \[Pedro\] Cieza confirms in Part 1, chapter 24 of his history of Peru.

They struck down those they met, and those whom they had struck down were immediately wasted by disease, (\'a particularly virulent, burning blast which is why the Jews call these evil spirits Mererim and Rhessaphim, \'deadly\' and \'burning\' or \'fiery\'\'). \[Procopius says\] this happened to some people while they were awake in broad daylight, (there you have the evil spirit at midday), and to some while they were asleep at night, (there you have the evil spirit of the night).

Another was \'Gelo\' about whom Nicephorus tells us the following while, among other things, he is talking about the things which foretold Maurice\'s becoming Emperor. \'When his mother was giving birth, she said that a strange, constantly changing, sweet smell was given off by the earth. She added-and this sounds like an old wives\' tale, and I have grave doubts about it-that very often a female called \"Empusa\", (but someone else said was \"Gilo\"), took the child out of its cradle as if she intended to eat him, but that she was unable to do him any harm at all\'.

<div align="center"><b>Women Accused of Infant Murder Through Closed Doors</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 198-199</div>
This was partly a bit of old women\'s nonsense, partly not nonsense but actually true. It was nonsense and out of step with reason to think that these women\'s bodies became so small that they could come through closed doors and push the bodies they had been born with through them. (See what I said in question 17.) \[But\] it was true that, with the help of an evil spirit, these wicked females were sometimes in the habit of entering the bedrooms-regardless of the fact that the size of their bodies could not change and penetrate solid objects-and once there making every effort to destroy the children. Consequently, the judge who is unwilling to be ensnared by credulity or incredulity when it comes to these matters must distinguish carefully between them, and he must examine very carefully indeed all the circumstances relating to the judgements he is going to make, because it can happen that a judge acquits the accused of one of the charges of deception which have been brought against him, although he would have been found guilty had the charge been brought in a different way. For example, suppose some vampire witch \[strix\] is accused of having entered \[somewhere\] through closed doors, having changed her body into spirit form, and thus, no longer in physical form, has killed the children. No judge will be stupid enough to believe this accusation, and if the accused denies it, there is no agreed evidence from someone other than \[the accuser\] that the children have been killed or harmed, and the accuser cannot prove his case other than by referring to the story in \[Ovid\'s\] Metamorphoses, she will undoubtedly receive a verdict of acquittal. If you read carefully the biography of Tarasius, written by the monk Ignatius, you will have no difficulty in understanding that this was the situation in the case of the women acquitted by George, (not Philip, as some people call him), the city governor, and that it was the cruelty and ignorance of Isaurus Leo which had put them in that position because, in his incredible stupidity, he believed that the women had changed themselves into spirit form. Listen to what Ignatius says. \'Some poverty-stricken women had been accused of murdering infants at the breast by coming through a hole in the house \[walls\]⁵ or through closed doors, and killing the children before anyone realised it was happening. They were hauled into court by those who believed fairy stories\'-he is talking about the story of Gillo which had been made up by pagans in ancient times-\'and were unwilling to follow the teaching of Christ, our God, which is not in the least deceived by ghosts \[spectris\] and mental apparitions \[phantasmatibus\]. In the fairy stories told by the Greeks, you see, there is a woman called \"Gello\" who is said to have died before her time and to have come in various spectral forms to newly-born infants and killed them\'. (There\'s a fairy story for you! A dead woman came back and committed infanticide!) \'Having been enticed and deceived by the wicked spirit \[improbo spiritu\] of this story, those who were making a plausible job of saying these things tried to transfer this cursed crime to the women by saying that they had changed themselves into spirit form and that they were the reason \[the children\] were dying before their time\'. You see the basis of the charge, Reader. They single out \[the notion\] that the dead Gello had killed the little children; it is discovered that many of them have been carried off suddenly; therefore, it is probable it was done by these women who got rid of their body\'s bulk, changed themselves into spirit form, and in this fashion inserted themselves through solid objects or thin cracks and murdered \[the children\]. Isn\'t the writer justified in exclaiming against such accusers in the following terms? \'What stupidity! What blindness of the eyes of the heart! If the body, which has been put together and moulded by length, depth, and breadth were dissolved into spirit form, and allowed to do this, then Christ, who is truth itself, says, \"A spirit does not have flesh and bones\", \[Luke 24.39\]. It is those who make this assertion who think it is a phantom, namely, \[those who have said\] that these women were not physical beings, but spirits, or had been endowed with this spiritual power of penetrating \[solid objects\]. Moreover Christ, who took real flesh and rightly told His disciples that a spirit does not have flesh and bones, will not be limited by any object He meets to being a figment of the \[passive\] imagination. Thinking along these lines, therefore, and making a judgement without much hesitation, George acquitted these women of the crimes.\'

<div align="center"><b>Adam the Lay-Brother's Encounter with a Shape-Shifting Evil Spirit</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 200-200</div>
A more recent example, (but you will scarcely find one like it), was recorded for posterity by \[Robert\] Gaguin in his History of the French. During the reign of Philippe le Bel, a lay-brother, (or \'convert\' as the French call them), from the Monastery of Vallis Sarnarii, by the name of Adam, was riding along the road very early in the morning with a serf-attendant a little before Christmas on monastery business when an enormous tree, covered in frost and rime, presented itself to him on the way, hurrying towards him as though to join its pace and bulk to his. His terrified horse jerked its head back and tried to go back the way it had come. With an immense effort Adam restrained the animal and spurred it forward. When it was quite close to the tree, the tree suddenly vanished from sight, leaving behind a dreadful smell of sulphur. From this Adam deduced that the apparition was an evil spirit, and fell to prayer, commending himself to God. But he did not interrupt his journey. A little while later he looked back and saw that a black man, sitting on a chestnut-brown horse, was following him. \'How is it\', he said, \'wretched, damned \[creature\], that you dare attack me with these tricks of yours? Don\'t you know that my brethren back in the monastery are pouring out prayers and supplications to God for my safety? Go away and be quick about it. I have nothing in which you can be interested and possess nothing which belongs to you\'. The wicked \[spirit\] went away but, lo and behold, returned a moment or two later in the shape of a man with a long, slender neck. Adam, sick of being bothered so often, drew a sword which had been fastened to his saddle, and waved it in the air two or three times. It split the air so quickly that it made a whistling sound. He tried to drive the apparition away, but it suddenly changed its appearance and stood where it was in the form of a man of middling height, wearing a hood on its head and a monk\'s scapular. Its eyes sparkled like steel or bronze caught in the sun\'s rays. Adam tried to stab his enemy several times, but his blows had no effect or force and merely parted the air. Then, in greater contempt and derision, the evil spirit took the form of an ass. The servant was terrified and persuaded his master to draw a circle on the ground with his sword and to make a cross with arms of equal length in the middle of it. Adam followed his advice, but the old fox did not stop. It changed its ass\'s ears into horns and in this shape, and in a most threatening manner, pretended it wanted to burst into the circle. Finally, it had had enough of the game and turned itself into a wheel which then rolled forward and attacked the monk. Carried by its continuous rolling, it crossed over the circle, leaving the monk completely unharmed, and disappeared from sight. The long sickness which followed his servant\'s terror, the long-lasting stench of Adam\'s clothes, the hoarseness of his voice and his difficulty in breathing from which he found it difficult to recover, assured people of the truth of what he and his servant had been through. So did the sudden change in his horse which, after this vision, \[ceased to be\] tame and tractable and started to be fierce, to throw its rider to the ground, and to kick out.

In Trithemius\'s Chronicle of Hirsau, we read, under the year 1168, that a very large number of cavalry and infantry, drawn up in battle-lines as though going to fight, appeared near Worms to a monk \[called\] Limpugius. When the monk was dating enough to ask who they were, they replied they were not real, living soldiers, but the souls of soldiers, and that long since they had died in this very spot in the service of a certain prince. Their uniforms, weapons, and horses, \[they said\], which had been tools of sin while they were alive were evidence of their punishment, now they were dead. Everything he saw round them was merely the fire in which they were being burned and he could help them with his prayers and supplications.

A Spanish priest, too, while walking from one village to another at dusk near the Count\'s castle, saw an immense tournament of dead people screaming and shouting, \'Sir Walter of Milene! Sir Walter of Milene!\', this Walter being a well-known knight who had recently died. \[Caesarius\] adds that this vision quite often vanished that night and then appeared again.

<div align="center"><b>Knight Beheaded by Phantom Horseman in Bohemia</b></div>

Johannes Nider tells the following story. \'When the kingdom of Bohemia was being shaken by insurrection and slaughter on account of heresies, not far from the borders of the kingdom, next to a particular valley, people heard shouting at night and quite often saw presses of horsemen who were dressed in different colours. On the occasion I am describing, there were two rather bold knights in a castle not very far from the spot where these prodigies were happening. The knights wanted to know if there was any truth at all in these visions and hastily went at night to a boundary wall from which people had been accustomed to see them. But before they dared come near \[those visions\], one \[knight\] had pangs of doubt and said to the other man, \"We\'ve seen them. Let that be enough. I\'m not going anywhere near them. What\'s the old saying? \'One shouldn\'t make a joke of this kind of thing\". The other \[knight\] rebuked him for being timid, spurred his horse on, and man and horse drew near all the foresaid armed men. One \[horseman\] came out \[from the crowd\], cut off \[the knight\'s\] head, and rejoined his companions, and when the timid knight saw this, he fled and told everyone the dreadful things which had just happened. The headless body was discovered the next day, along with its head, in the valley where the armed men had been seen, but no trace of any human being or horse was found. However, certain signs and traces of something ill-omened were seen in the mud\'.

<div align="center"><b>Soldier Rides with Dead Cook and Phantom Army to Jerusalem</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 202-203</div>
\[Nider\] adds that he was told this story, and another one, by the Archbishop of Mainz, a very hard-working man and a person worthy of being believed. \'He told me\', (says \[Nider\]), \'the name of a soldier from the Rhine whom he knew very well, and whose son was alive at the time. This soldier had always been a prominent figure among almost all the nobles of Lower Germany because in warlike situations he was completely fearless. Because of his high-spiritedness and courage, he used to carry out serious raids and sometimes suffered them in his turn at the hands of other people. In pursuit of these \[raids\] he was in the habit of riding out-not always during the day, but also at night-to places where he would have the advantage. So on one particular night, with some hand-picked servants, he wanted to ride through a forest near the Rhine and entered it where it started. But before he came to the end of the forest, beyond which lay a broad open space, just as people do when they fear an ambush, he sent a servant ahead to where the forest ended to see whether there was any ambush \[waiting for him\] on the open space, because \[such an ambush\] could be seen under the light of the moon and the twinkling of the stars. So when the servant peered through the branches of the trees and saw a quite extraordinary army strung together the length of the open space and approaching on horseback. When he had seen this, he reported the results of his inspection to the soldier who said, \"Let\'s stay where we are for the moment, because it\'s likely that others are following close behind as a rear-guard for this army. We\'ll make a dash towards them, and we\'ll not be afraid of \[their\] small numbers, whether the advance troops turn out to be hostile or friendly\". Then, after a brief delay, the soldier and his men left the forest, came into the open space, and saw no one except a man sitting on a horse, following his people at a distance, and leading another horse. The soldier came towards him and asked him who he was, saying, \"Aren\'t you my cook?\" (because, from a distance, that is who he thought it was. The soldier\'s cook had died not long previously.) \[The man\] answered, \"Yes, my lord.\" The soldier said, \"What are you doing here, and who are the men who came before you did?\" The dead man replied, \"My lord, those who preceded me are the nobles and knights such and such.\" (He gave many of them their own names, you see.) \"They and I have to be in Jerusalem tonight, because this is our punishment.\" The soldier asked again, \"Why do you need the horse you are leading when there\'s no one sitting on it?\" \"It will be at your service\", came the reply, \"if you want to come to the Holy Land with me. Don\'t be alarmed. I shall bring you there and back alive, on my word as a Christian, if you heed my warnings.\" Then the soldier said, \"I have attempted many extraordinary things in my time. I\'ll add this strange \[experience\] to them.\" While his servants tried to persuade him not to, the soldier jumped down from his own horse, mounted the dead man\'s horse, and both riders were carried away from the servants\' eyes. The next day, however, the servants waited in accordance with their instructions, and the soldier and the dead man returned to the place where they had first met. Then the dead man said to the soldier, \"So that you don\'t think this vision was an entire fiction, I am giving you two unusual things. Keep them in memory of me.\" Then he produced a small piece of cloth made from asbestos and a little knife in a sheath. \"When the \[cloth\] is dirty\", he said, \"clean it with fire. When you draw the knife, do so carefully because if it cuts you, it will poison you.\"

\[Marcin\] Kromer, a careful writer, says, \'The King of Poland, Vladislaus I, was besieging Naclum, a very well-fortified castle in Pomerania. The sentries there quite often saw lines, as it were of soldiers, in the moonlight, galloping towards the Polish camp and assaulting it from the open fields. This happened fairly frequently and so the Poles became angry and restless, and since the enemy nowhere got as far as open fighting, one night, when they were told the enemy was at hand at that very moment, they gave a great roar and charged out of their camp in a great mass and, in a fruitless attempt, pursued them as they fled in different directions. The besieged \[Pomeranians\] heard the noise the Poles were making and suddenly burst out from the fortress in a hostile charge. They worked quickly to spread \[fire\] round in several places while the few who had stayed behind in the fortress defended themselves, and easily set the siege-engines and a large part of the camp on fire. They claimed that the perpetrators were ghosts of the night who, under the appearance of a hostile army, attacked the Poles this way with God\'s permission, the particular reason being that they had violated the Lenten fast which should be observed by all Christians, and had rashly and heedlessly eaten flesh and food containing milk in defiance of the usages and ordinances of the Catholic Church.\'

She, in her turn, gave him a gold ring and an enchanted pectoral. Her nurse went solicitously to make sure the guest did not lack anything and saw the girl she had nursed lying in bed with him. Delighted, she told [Philinnion's] parents and they, full of astonishment, ran [to the room] and, on the second day, took the two of them by surprised. With a wail, they embraced their daughter who was sleeping alongside their guest. But Philinnion looked at them grimly and said, "Father, Mother, you were cruel to your daughter, and because of your prejudice against me I have been enjoying my Machates in my father's house for fully three days. Whether it was over-anxiousness on your part or lack of feeling, it will stay with you and cause you great sorrow. You will grieve all over again and bury your daughter a second time".

She finished speaking, turned very pale, and her corpse collapsed like a dead person again-or rather, it actually was dead-and her parents, overwhelmed with grief, collapsed at the same time. The people and magistrates found out about this incident and ordered that [Philinnion's] tomb be opened. They found no body there, only the iron ring and gilded cup Machates had given her. Philinnion's corpse was found in the bedroom, on the bed, and because it was a monstrous portent, on the advice of Hyllos, an augur, it was thrown outwith the city bounds to be devoured by birds and wild animals. Machates himself, realising he had been deceived by an apparition and unable to bear the shame, killed himself not long afterwards.

what Caesarius, the monk of Heisterbach, writes about the same subject in Book 12, chapter 3 of his [Discussion of Miracles. After the body of a dead German prince had been buried for a whole year, an evil spirit got hold of it and, as though he were giving it life, exercised control over it. (This is how one should interpret [Caesarius] when he writes, 'the spirit quickened the [body] in place of its soul'.)

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 210-211</div>
Caesarius adds similar things, (which one can read in his biography of St Patrick, the Apostle of the Irish), about someone whose body a devil inhabited for many years in the place of the man's soul.

At length, [the devil] came out of him at the command of a holy man and the body fell down and was reduced to dust.

The monk spoke earnestly and solemnly to the evil spirit, and when it went away, the corpse fell down and stank most dreadfully.

In The Hammer of Women who Work Harmful Magic, Jakob Sprenger tells us about vapour.

Magicians from Mans, Mirabellius and his associates, who were burned in Paris, said in their judicial confession that two things were necessary for an evil spirit to assume bodies-a favourable wind and a full moon, because if the wind is against him he cannot get the body to coalesce, and if there is a waning or a new moon he cannot form a body because he has only enough material for one which is very small indeed. The bigger the moon, the bigger [the body he can make].

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 212-212</div>
Undoubtedly the apparition of the incestuous Persian, whose corpse kept on being thrown out by the earth, was of the kind we are discussing. There is a lengthy account of it by Agathias at the end of Book 2 of his Persian War.

<div align="center"><b>The Statue Illusion in Gunerchena</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 212-213</div>
I find that a third kind of apparitions of evil spirits takes place, very infrequently, through certain images or statuettes, and I shall tell you what Thomas of Cantimpré said about these in Book 2 of his Universal Good, chapter 57, paragraph 21.

'Gunerchena is a remarkable and well-known village in Brabant. Here a young man fell in love with a young girl, but when he spoke to her parents about marrying her, they refused. It was not long before the girl fell into an acute fever, and when she grew worse everyone thought she was dead. There was much lamentation, and the bells were rung as though for someone who had died. Without delay the girl's young lover left the village at twilight and was making his way to another [village] when, as he was passing some thickets, he heard a noise like that of a woman weeping. He ran to and fro, anxiously trying to find [the source] of the sound and discovered the girl he thought was dead.

"Your family is mourning you because you're dead", he said to her. "Where have you come from?"

"Oh, a man went ahead of me and showed me the way", she said. The young man was astonished at this, since he could see no one else except the girl, so boldly he hurried her away and immediately hid her in a house outwith the town. From here he came back to the village and spoke to his friends, then he and his friends went to the girl's father who was sitting by the corpse. [The young man] asked him if he would let him have his daughter whom he was mourning as though she were dead.

Her father was amazed and said, "Surely to God you are not saying to me that you will raise her from the dead and take her as your wife?"

The young man said, "Only if you willingly swear I can have your daughter as my wife if I give her back [to you] alive and cured".

Her father agreed and confirmed his promise in front of everyone. A moment later, the young man pulled aside a linen cloth which they thought was covering [the girl's body], and found a remarkable statue, the like of which could not have been made by human hands. Those who have taken a close look at devilish statues of this kind, however, say that inside the wood appears to be rotten and that the outside is wrapped in thin skin. After this the girl was brought back and restored to her father, and a few days later, now fully recovered, she took the young man as her husband and lived, safe and sound, right up to the present day.

<div align="center"><b>The Statue Deception in Flanders</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 213-213</div>
An almost similar instance is that of a man in the territory of Flanders. His sister fell ill and people thought she had died. On the day before she was to be buried, [her brother] found a statue in a thicket of reeds next to the sea-shore. He took [his sister] back to his own house, then entered the house where his friends were mourning her as if she were dead. He drew his sword, uncovered the statue, and cut it to pieces. Everyone was frightened and cried out, "Why would you behave with such savage barbarity towards your sister's corpse?" He smiled [and said], "Do I look as though I am being cruel to my sister? That is not my sister's body, but an image [of her], an illusion [created] by evil spirits". So saying, he took them all with him, brought them to his own house, and showed them his sister whom he had brought back. She, too, lived right up to the present day'.

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 215-215</div>
An old author writes [as follows] in his life of Abbot St Robert. 'One night the holy man saw that something malign was standing at the entrance to the choir and was, in fact, making attempts to enter, although these attempts came to nothing. It had the form of a peasant with his tunic pulled up over long bare legs. He was carrying a little basket on his back and had a piece of wood fastened to his chest with cords. He started to walk round the choir with his neck thrust forward, casting his eyes intently on the brothers to see if he could perhaps notice something in one of them which would be pleasing to him. The [holy] man, however, started praying more earnestly to God and rousing the brothers from their listlessness, and the impudent spy was kept waiting for a long time to no avail. When he saw he was achieving nothing, he grew angry and took himself off to the lay-brothers' choir. There he also observed everyone inquisitively.

If he saw they were drowsy, he laughed and rejected them; if they were occupied with harmful thoughts, he broke into applause and started dancing in an extraordinary fashion. At length, he found a young man among the novices, whose mind was wandering off towards forbidden things. He was present only in body and, indeed, having secret thoughts about running away. Noting, therefore, that this man had captured his interest, the peasant] seized hold of him with a small three-pronged fork, thrust him into his little basket, and quickly rushed away from there. The holy man noticed this and was very anxious and concerned for the young man's salvation. In the morning he made diligent inquiry after him, but the youth with his wandering thoughts had fled before dawn, shaken off Christ's gentle yoke, and followed His enemy.

He joined a band of criminals, took to thieving, and not long afterwards was arrested and executed, ending his life in a most wretched fashion'.

<div align="center"><b>Agrippa's Walking Corpse in Leuven</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 219-219</div>
Magicians, too, with the help of evil spirits of a higher rank, (because of their mutual pact), can compel evil spirits of lower rank to enter a corpse, wear it, move it, and do everything else for the time being which make it seem to be alive. Cornelius Agrippa did this in Leuven. He used to have an inquisitive member of his household and on one occasion, when Agrippa went on a journey and left the keys of his library with his wife, (whom he later divorced), with the instruction that she was not to let anyone enter it, this ill-considered young man kept badgering the poor woman in and out of season until he succeeded in getting from her the means of entering \[the library\]. He went in, came across a small book of invocations, and read it.

Well now, lo and behold he was disturbed by a knocking at the door! He continued reading. Someone knocked again. The young man, who was inexperienced in these things, did not answer at all and an evil spirit came in. \'Why have you summoned me?\' it asked. \'What are your instructions?\' Fear stopped the young man from speaking. The evil spirit blocked his throat, and thus the wretched \[youth\] paid the price of his wicked curiosity. Meanwhile the arch-magician returned to the house and saw evil spirits jumping about all over it. He made use of his customary magic, and they answered his summons and told him what had happened. He ordered them to enter the corpse of a murderer and go for a walk every so often in the market-place, (where the rest of his students were accustomed to meet quite frequently), and leave the corpse there. The body walked there three or four times and then fell down as the \[spirit\] which was directing it left it. For a long time, people believed the corpse fell down because \[the man\] had died all of a sudden, but the signs of suffocation started to give rise to suspicion, and later on time revealed everything and Agrippa fled to Lotharingia and began to spew out the heresies had had been concealing.

<div align="center"><b>Enarchus's Return from the Dead</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 220-220</div>
There is an extraordinary story in Plutarch who tells us that Enarchus was left for dead by his doctors and was seen not long afterwards to come back to life. He said he really had risen again from the dead and that the evil spirits which had taken him away from life had been severely reprimanded by their prince because they had carried him off instead of Nicandas, a tanner, who had been seized by fever the same day and hour while lying in bed and had died of his illness.

Not content with this, in order to prove he had come back from the dead, he predicted to Plutarch, who was not well at the time, that he would soon be fully recovered-and that is how things turned out.

<div align="center"><b>Earl Richard and the Attacking Corpse</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 220-220</div>
Ranulf \[Higden\], the author of Polychronicon, tells us that one night Earl Richard went into a church all by himself to offer a prayer, and there found a bier on which a corpse had been laid out. \'All of a sudden, while the Earl was praying, the dead man jumped off the bier with a loud cry and came towards the Earl with his arms outstretched, as though to knock him down in his embrace. The Earl made the sign of the cross on his own forehead and somewhat forcefully adjured \[the dead man\] to go away. This he did not do, so \[the Earl\] drew his sword and cut him down, and thereafter gave instructions that watch was to be kept over corpses throughout the whole region\'.

<div align="center"><b>Seasonal Deaths in Lucomorye</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 220-220</div>
More extraordinary than either of these \[stories\] is one told by \[Robert\] Gaguin in his description of Muscovy, and I shall now add it \[to my account\]. \'Certain people living in Lucomorye, a province of Russia\', he writes, \'die every year on 27th November, as swallows and frogs are in the habit of doing, before the cold of winter sets in. Then, when spring returns, on 24th April, they come back to life again\'. He adds, \'When these people sense that death is near, they put goods they want to sell in certain places and their neighbours, the Grustintzi and Serponovtzi, take them away, leaving behind in the same spot payment of equivalent value. When the people of Lucomorye come back to life, they take this payment if they think it fair. If they do not, they ask for their goods back. It is said that this is why quarrels and wars very frequently arise between them\'.

<div align="center"><b>Voice from Ajax's Tomb</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 221-221</div>
Finally, also relevant here is the story about a German youth which I shall tell in the next question, which would be remarkable but for the fact that he pretended to be killed, even though he had not been killed, but had simply fainted away and then thought he was decapitated. Everyone else thought the same, since their eyes had been blinded, but his head had not been cut off, nor had it had been restored. It was all a conjuring-trick.

At this point, let me add one example of a fictitious resurrection. Antiquity had produced no story more convincing or more wonderful than this one. It took place in Dalheim in Lotharingia in 1581, and involved Petronius, a herdsman, and Abrahel, a succuba. In his summary of Book 2, that remarkable man, Nicolas Rémy, had shown most picturesquely and in very elegant verse, how Abrahel seduced Petronius into criminal embraces, then into the murder of his own small son, and finally, because of his grief and despair and a false resurrection of his child, into idolatry: and how the evil spirit presented him with a likeness of the living \[child\] for a whole year and then abandoned it as a corpse. I shall transcribe this with greater pleasure than equanimity because, as the result of the insupportably bad practice of its recent printer, the verses in \[Rémy\'s\] Worship of Evil Spirits have been removed and the work published in mutilated form. \[Thus\] they will be preserved unharmed, and in consequence will be read in more places.

\'There is a country in the middle of the bounds of an enormous kingdom Between the winding streams of the sandy Moselle And the straight courses of the Saar with its undisturbed river-bank. There is a village here called Delheim-not a well-known nameAnd while a herdsman was grazing his flock in a distant valley there And pondering the various cares which were rolling around in his heart, Perhaps sick of the unfairness attendant on his straitened circumstances, Or contemplating, with a degree of passion, revenge and anger Because of a loss he had suffered, or high words exchanged in a quarrel, A succuba presented herself quite unexpectedly.

She was most seductive. Her face had a maidenly expression, her gestures were charming, Her head was decked with false sapphires, And \[her hair\] was twisted into glistening curls on each side \[of her face\]. She comforted the unhappy man and gave him hope of becoming master of his situation, And promised him the wealth which the needy have so often prayed for in vain, Or which the long-eared king \[Midas\] was willing to demand of Iacchus \[Dionysus\] As long as he did not object to what he was saying. Just as when a fire which is quickened by a pair of bellows Licks the iron while the puffing renders \[the metal\] ductile, So that the hard \[substance\] is persuaded to be compliant And is prepared \[to receive\] all its instructions, And does not disregard the arts of persuasion: \[The herdsman\] is happy to submit to \[the succuba\'s\] alluring command, And on both sides trust is strengthened by a \[mutual\] pact. He made his way into her dreadful embraces. Their unequal love was cemented by senseless coition. Irreparable, freedom Died at once amid those unspeakable passions. And, just as the parts of a body wounded by the dangerous bite of snakes Spread the consequent poison throughout the whole body, So that health itself cannot provide what health requires, Even if it spreads itself as far as it can, So Abrahel took over her lover entirely.

<div align="center"><b>Petronius and the Succuba Abrahel</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 221-223</div>
When their cattle were being killed by murrain, they gathered at the tomb of Ajax, son of Telamon, in Sigeum, and heaped various curses on the dead man. One \[shepherd\], more forward than the rest, began to recite verses from Homer in which Ajax is described as running away-\'Aïas δ\' oùxéti µíuvev\' \[Ajax stayed no longer, Iliad 14.727\]-and a voice burst fiercely from the tomb, \"AMou \"piliov\' \[But I did stay\], and the shepherds, thoroughly frightened, took to their heels. The origin of the voice, you see, was an evil spirit.

And broke him by filthiness-this very wicked woman had designated it thus so that she could bend the vanquished man to any of her stipulations, and he could have absolutely no will \[of his own\] to say yes or no. Straight away and without hesitation she demanded an initial recompense for her violated virtue. \'Play your part\', she said, \'so that your love May be the equal of mine\'. There could be no greater proof of this Than if he conquered Nature and carried out a crime Any by this fresh deed subordinated a father\'s love to his passion. Therefore, since it was already late, he drove his whole flock Into the sheep-folds and finally settled himself in his little house.

First, so that his dear son would put his weak arms round his neck To support himself \[to receive his father\'s\] kisses, he drew out of his bagWhich his son was keen to search, although he had often found it empty When \[his father\] came back from the countryside-an apple and held it out to him. \[The boy\] had scarcely taken his first bite, grinding his teeth because he did not like the sour taste, Than he turned pale and sucked it hesitatingly with the tips of his lips, And lay stretched out on the ground which fell away behind him. If \[his father\] could look at this with equanimity While carrying out his orders with this pledge, It would be strong evidence that his was still cleaving to his new love.

Such an unspeakable crime horrified him to begin with And Nature and passion fought each other in a battle whose outcome was uncertain. But he who introduced a powerful enemy into an empty citadel Hesitated in vain to carry out his instructions, because if he did nothing in response to her first command when she entreating him seductively, The insolent woman immediately passed to violent anger And her will, ever present, was like statute law to him. Now the evening which was obliged to be privy to so great a crime Had brought back to the threshold of his cottage the father entangled in these dreadful things. When his son met him and spontaneously greeted him with a big hug as usual, He groaned, and shifted from foot to foot, and stammered. Yet this did not stop him at all from \[fulfilling\] his wicked promises.

The cruel man Dared to continue to reach for the deadly gifts of murder. Let his son be the victim of an abominable love! His father did not shrink from slaughtering him with his own hand. Straight away Nature, which had allowed herself to be concealed And had withdrawn because of his feigned excuses, came out more ardently and rose up powerfully with grief; And while \[this grief\] fed on the feeble advantages \[he had wanted to gain\] And his ill-considered weeping, the woman stood nearby to give him her advice. The moment he killed \[the boy\], she consoled him And, at the same time, promised to restore \[the boy\] to life and make him live again, If \[the father\] would willingly worship her and, as a suppliant, beg this of her; And he, who had \[morally\] bankrupted himself earlier, Readily agreed to this turn of events, for which he would pay an extremely heavy rate of interest.

And while the fickle man wanted to appease, in any way he could, The gods of his household whom he had dishonoured by the foul murder of his son, He disgraced them even more and polluted them more repulsively Because first of all he threw himself on his knees before the evil spirit And worshipped it forthwith as a divinity. Then he promised the boy to her as payment, If only, with her help, his last-born child could feed himself upon life-giving air once more, \[Begging her\] just as when winds join battle and cast themselves An angry sea, and a sailor trembles in every limb quite uncertain of his life, and is lavish in his pleas to all the gods, And tires them out with his prayers.

The corpse lay on its back on the mound where it had been thrown When life had finally fled and abandoned it, And its mother, very late in the day, began to make haste to bury it. But look! \[The child\'s\] body seemed to stir itself between her hands as she touched him And gradually once again to overcome \[death\] with \[living\] heat. The kind of light those who are half-alive, half-dead show in their downcast eyes, Or which, with difficulty, releases those who have been plunged deep in sleepThese signs of health restored, beyond what people hope, Seize them and give them joy, and with as much eagerness as they can The vigorously warm the powerless limbs And recall now the arms, now the legs, to their living functions.

The boy rose to his feet straight away, then Took a step, can called to his parents in the voice they knew well; Only he was different in appearance from \[the boy\] he had once been, Because he had a face \[rendered\] ugly because the skin was drawn tight over it, And because a gloomy stupidity was in possession of his receding eyes. A foreign life, therefore, quickened the senses which had been deserted And in this apparition restored the breath which had once been there, (As Virbius once obtained the light \[of life\] which had been cut off from him). But the mind was not the same, and the breath Which used to warm his life did not now exercise that same office. An evil spirit provided the mechanism to drive the sluggish bulk, Give it the appearance of life, and imitate the actions of \[human\] behaviour, Breathing \[into it the actions\] which Nature used to carry out for herself. At length, the moment a year had run its whole course And completed its circuit of the dense globe, \[The evil spirit\] abandoned its stopping-place and left the dwelling empty.

It betrayed its flight by a sulphurous smell and a noisy din, And pushed itself out, bursting forth into stinking gusts of air. Then the corpse fell down, thrust away by this second death. There followed a foetid stench and \[the body became\] very heavy. A kind of numbness \[caused by\] unhindered emotion covered the motionless \[child\] Completely with earth, and cut off the widespread strength of the stench So that it could not gain entrance to human nostrils. \[The body\] was carried away from the house by a hook firmly attached to it, And the dishonoured remains were laid under a clean sod cut from the earth, While the father, who had been mad enough to shame Nature this way With his disgraceful act, shuddered at what he had done\'.

There are also the cases of Gabinius, Polycritus, and Publius whose heads predicted the future, and the example from Apuleius about Socrates whose head was cut off by a female inn-keeper who was also an aged sorceress \[veratrix\]. Having cut it off, she joined it to the body again by sticking a sponge \[under the cut\]; but next day, when the unfortunate man, contrary to her instruction, drank from a river, the sponge fell out and he lost his head because it really had been cut off and its restoration was counterfeit, \[Metamorphoses 1.16-18\].

<div align="center"><b>Magicians' Deadly Tricks at the English Queen's Court</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 226-227</div>
Two magicians came together at the court of the English queen in order to put on an entertaining show and made a remarkably friendly agreement to obey each other in one [of their tricks]. The first one told the other to look down from a window, but when he did this, all of a sudden stag's horns sprouted from his head and for a long time everyone wanted to pull faces and mock him. Consequently, rendered powerless by the insult and wanting to avenge himself in a more savage fashion, [the second magician] drew a human figure on a wall with charcoal, then ordered the first magician to go up to the figure. As he was about to do so, he noticed it was devising instant death for him and, filled with horror, he warded it off with prayer.

The other [magician] reminded him forcefully of their agreement and so, under this compulsion, [the magician] went up to [the figure]. The wall seemed to make room for his body as he approached, but once he had come right up to [the wall], he was never seen again anywhere afterwards. In other words, an evil spirit of higher rank had killed him and taken his body away to an uninhabited place or a cave somewhere else.

<div align="center"><b>The Decapitation Illusion and the Lily Counterspell</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 226-227</div>
In N', he says, 'an illusionist [praestigiator] who came from a good family decapitated their host's servant, in a public guest-house, at the request of the other guests. But when he wanted to put the man's head back on again, he noticed there was another magician in the room who was stopping him from carrying out his intention. [The illusionist] asked him not to do that, but when [the magician] would not comply after being asked more than once, the illusionist made a lily grow on the table, and when he cut off its head and flowers, the magician who had been impeding him immediately fell [from his seat at] the table minus his head; and straight away, without hindrance, the illusionist put the magician's head on the servant and then fled the guest-house and the city to avoid being arrested by the magistrate on a charge of murder.

<div align="center"><b>Zyto Swallows the Bavarian Performer</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 226-227</div>
A fourth [example] concerns Zyto of Bohemia, a well-known illusionist, who was engaged in a contest with Bavarians. Jan Dubravius tells us what happened. 'Wenceslaus, Emperor and King of Bohemia', he says, 'was a relation by marriage of John, the Prince of Bavaria, because he had married his daughter, Sophia. His father-in-law knew that his son-in-law took pleasure in stage-plays and magical illusions, and so he filled a wagon with actors and illusionists and took them with him to Prague. There, while the most remarkable of the performers was displaying his professional stunts to delight people's eyes, among the spectators was Zyto, Wenceslaus's magician, his mouth gaping open in a great yawn. He came nearer the Bavarian performer and suddenly swallowed him and all his equipment, with the exception of his shoes which he spat out because they seemed to be covered in mud. Looking for a way to get rid of [what he had swallowed], he unburdened his stomach, which was heavy with its unusual food, into a bathtub filled with water and restored the illusionist, still wet, to the spectators'.

<div align="center"><b>Gilbert and Catillus's Magical Contest</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 227</div>
My fifth [example] will be taken from Olaus [Magnus] Book 3, chapter 20. Here a magician called Gilbert was arguing with Catillus, his instructor, about superiority in the practice of magic. [Catillus] pointed a tiny stick inscribed with Gothic or Ruthenian characters at him, so [Gilbert] took hold of him. [Catillus] became rigid at once and was carried away, trussed up, to an underground cave on an island in a lake called 'Veter' by the Ostrogoths.

<div align="center"><b>The Chaldaean Magician Bound by Holy Prayers</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 228</div>
This is proved by the complaint of the Chaldaean magician in St Augustine who 'kept complaining that the great effort he was making to be successful in purging his soul was rendered ineffectual because a man who had power over this and was touched by envy had bound the Powers he had invoked with holy prayers, the result being that they could not grant what was demanded of them.'

<div align="center"><b>Cynops's Pact with Evil Spirits</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 228</div>
Eusebius tells us the same thing, and quite clearly it applies to the magician Cynops in Prochorus, (whoever he was), [who says] that when 'St John was questioning evil spirits about why they were in the habit of obeying Cynops, one of them replied, "Because the entire power of Satan resides in him, and he has a treaty and pact with every one of our princes. We, too, on our part, have a pact with him and so Cynops obeys us and we him"'. In the absence of such a pact, every attempt made by magicians against evil spirits is useless, since these work only because of the pact, (as I said in question 2.)

<div align="center"><b>John the German Evokes Ancestral Shadows</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 228-229</div>
Let me write down what one reads about that last one in the author of the German adages, because it is appropriate, and not unpleasant, to blunt the boasting of certain people who are themselves morally degenerate, and prattle about the smoky images of their ancestors, and [say] they did things they themselves have not done. Hence, they write that although [John] was illegitimate, he had a great reputation for learning and was promoted to a canonry at Halberstadt, a post not usually granted to anyone unless he came from a good family. The fault common to good families-pride-made his fellow-canons despise him. He was irked by this and finally decided to remedy his annoyance.

He invited his colleagues to dinner and received them in most elegant fashion; and among all his other pleasantries he included mention of a magical performer and suggested that each man would surely like to see his own parents. They were indeed extremely keen to see them and after a while, by means of a wicked incantation, [the magician] evoked the misshapen shadowy forms of a cook, a pub landlord, a professional jester, and a peasant. [The canons] admitted they had sometimes seen these faces in their parents' homes. [John's] own father was shown, too, dressed as a canon, with a fat paunch. The shadowy forms were dismissed, and then [John] said, 'Well now! Tell me honestly, is there anyone's father here you think is better born [than the others]? ' Thoroughly frightened and filled with shame, each of them went back home and from then on did not accuse John of any imperfection in his blood-line.

<div align="center"><b>St Stephen Commands Evil Spirits to Appear</b></div>

St Stephen, Bishop of Perm, 'told the evil spirits, who were turning people away to prevent them from listening to him, to show themselves openly in visible form. They did as they were told and appeared-immensely tall, completely black, with horns [on their heads], and breathing out stench and flames', (Sauer in his biography [of St Stephen], under the month of September).

<div align="center"><b>The Fish Heart Drives Away the Evil Spirit in Tobit</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 230-231</div>
There is a passage in Tobit which runs as follows: 'if you put a small part of the heart' [of the fish "Callyonimus"] 'on top of charcoal, its smoke will clear out every kind of evil spirit', and we read later that this was done. My response is that this suffumigation drove the spirit away indirectly. The angel Raphael was the one who expelled the evil spirit directly and despatched him to an uninhabited place. In consequence, the whole action was attributed to Raphael afterwards, 'He (Raphael) chased away the evil spirit from her'.

<div align="center"><b>David's Harp Repels the Evil Spirit from Saul</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 231</div>
They beckon us in the direction of David's harp but do so in vain because in that instance it was not the pleasant tune which was the direct cause of putting the evil spirit to flight. When the King had been soothed by the harmoniousness of the music, as long as David was playing the harp, at any rate, the humours which were agitating him started to settle themselves down to some extent, and in the meantime were in a less suitable state to be affected by the evil spirit's stirring them up. This is why the wicked [spirit] began to retire at that moment-not because it was pleased or offended by the music, but because it would find it difficult to put up with the fact that its possession of its dwelling-place was being thrown into disorder, so to speak, by this improvement in the mingling of [the King's] humours.

<div align="center"><b>The Cursed Box and the Possessed Wife in Kleinbasel</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 232-233</div>
One, recounted by Johannes Nider as follows, will be sufficient. 'A little before the present General Council, a man of wicked life had a house in Kleinbasel and, as it happened, and had come under reasonable suspicion of performing acts of harmful magic [maleficiis]. He had a daughter and married her to a young man in his house, and when at length the old man fell ill, he pointed out a box to his daughter and son-in-law and said, "Don't move this little box, because if you do, you'll regret it. Let it stay where it is after I am dead", and thus not long afterwards the old man expired.

A long time went by. Neither his daughter nor her husband paid any great heed to her father's instruction, and when they moved from their former home to another little house which was big enough [for them], they carried the box to their new home. During the journey, however, it started to weigh so much that [the husband's] strength failed him, and he called on his wife to help him. Whether his wife opened the box later in the house, or whether somehow or other she forgot [what her father had said] about the box, people agree on one thing-the two of them came into their new house with a small child they had begotten. Well now, all of a sudden, the wife rushed at the cradle like a raving mad woman, with the intention of killing the child. Her husband saw this, forcibly seized hold of his wife, and realised she was under the control of an evil spirit. While the evil spirit was being exorcised, it threatened it would not leave unless [her husband] killed her, which he did in spite of the exorcist's trying to prevent him. Next day her husband was making his way along a pavement in the town when, quite unexpectedly, he was struck by a stone falling from the upper part of a water-channel which was coming away [from the building]. It struck him, apparently with the co-operation of an evil spirit, in the face and rendered him so ugly that he scarcely seemed to be a human being.'

<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 233</div>
St Conon, for example, about whom the Jesuit Matthias Rader gives the following account in The Succession of the Months among the Greeks, under 'March'. 'He exercised such great force and power over evil spirits that he would put some of them in charge of the fields and make them guardians of the crops. Others he would imprison in sealed-up buildings and bury in the foundation of a church he intended to build.

Likewise, St Lupus imprisoned one in Sens, afflicting him with thirst and inserting him, wailing and proclaiming who he was, in a small vessel of cold water he had told someone to bring. (This is what his ancient biographer says in Sauer, under the month of September.)

<div align="center"><b>The Familiar Spirit Demands Gold for a Church Bell</b></div>
<div align="center">"Martin Del Rio - Investigations Into Magic Volume 2" Pages 234</div>
I remember reading in Johannes Caesarius the exemplary story-well worth remembering-of a familiar spirit [paredri].

In this story, what one finds astonishing is that the evil spirit demanded five gold coins as his price and gave orders for a bell to be purchased with them for a poor church so that it could summon the faithful to divine worship every Sunday. There was undoubtedly some deception lying hidden here, and the hope of a larger sum of money was blindingly obvious. It is also remarkable that he caused the soldier no harm.
