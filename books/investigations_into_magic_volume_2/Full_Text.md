Book Two

Magic Involving Evil Spirits

This is the most important subject for discussion in my work and so, in order to discuss it as lucidly as possible, let me \[divide it\] into several chapters or questions.

Book 2, Question 1

Is there such a thing as magic involving evil spirits?

Those who, along with the Sadducees, Democritus, Aristotle, Averroes, and Simplicius, deny the existence of evil spirits, also deny the existence of this kind of magic. Their opinion is irreligious and heretical because both evil spirits and magic involving evil spirits do exist. This \[magic\] does not rely upon the deliberate intention or the skill of human beings or natural causes, but upon some kind of non-material, independent power. That this is established fact is proved by the testimonies offered by Holy Scripture and the historical accounts and experiences of all ages which simply bring lighted lamps to the assistance of broad daylight. Along with St Augustine, all Catholic theologians and the majority of natural philosophers prove this point: Trismegistus and the Pythagoreans; the Platonists Psellus, Plotinus, Proclus, Iamblichus, Chalcidius, and Apuleius; and the Aristotelians Theophrastus, Ammonius, Philoponus, Avicenna, and Algazel.

Giving replies \[to questions\] about concealed thefts, and treasures: learning several branches of knowledge instantaneously without the bother of having to work at it: making an object disappear before the eyes of onlookers: and innumerable things of this kind---can they be traced back to any cause other than some kind of nature which is intelligent and different \[from that of everyone else\]? Finally, we know that, as recently as our grandfathers' memory, there were famous schools of this dark magic \[goetia\] in Salamanca and Toledo in Spain, at Lake Norcia in Italy, and in the Visignian cave.

Book 2, Question 2

From where does this magic come, and who invented it?

There are those who say that evil spirits exist but deny that this kind of magic has its origin in evil spirits or devils \[diaboli\]. They attribute its effects either to God\'s operating directly through this kind of magician, or to God\'s using good angels in order to produce them. The former say that certain graces, such as those of language and health, have been given freely, and that it is not unusual for these gifts to be granted, as in the case of Balaam and other wicked individuals.

First, I say that this opinion is entirely blasphemous because it attributes to magical practices something which belongs properly to graces freely given, and jumbles together conjuring-tricks and genuine miracles. Secondly, it makes God\'s free gifts subject to human artifice and certain ridiculous practices. Thirdly, \[it says\] that God would unfairly and in a spirit of envy prohibit something He Himself graciously bestows on human beings as a favour. Opposing arguments, which are found in well-known passages of Holy Scripture, prove only that effects such as these happen (up to a point) through magical practices and through graces freely given, and also that sometimes, for the propagation of the Faith as well as His own divine glory, God produces miracles through wicked people. The fact is that someone who operates through the gift of a grace freely given is not restricted to a particular time \[of day\], or occasion, or specific ceremonies, as is usually the case with magicians \[magi\] who accomplish nothing if they are found wanting in the slightest degree. Nor can gifts of this kind, freely given by God, be taught to others and passed on through instruction. Magicians, however, do hand on this magic to their pupils, and once those who listen to them have followed their teachers\' instructions, they do the same things \[as their teachers\].

Others say these effects \[are produced\] by good angels whom they call \'spirits\' \[spiritus\] because of their high status. This is what the celebrated modern magician, Scotus of Parma, used to boast. (He was the one who sent the apostate Bishop of Köln, Gebhard Truchsess \[von Waldeburg\], mad.) This is also the ancient fraudulent claim of Platonist magicians in particular Iamblichus, Porphyrius, Plotinus, Proclus, and Julian the Apostate. According to their tradition, all magic is divided into \'white\', which they think is lawful, and \'black\' which is unlawful. Hence, they call the white one Osoupyía \[theurgy\] and the black one yonteia \[goetia\]. Actually, the Arch-magician himself makes a good case for rejecting this plainly fictitious, foreign-based, theatrical \'theurgy\', when he testifies in clear terms that \'very often, under the names of God and angels, it is obligated to the wicked deceptions of evil spirits,\' and, \"although the greatest part of its ceremonies makes a show of cleanliness of mind, body, externals, and utensils, yet it searches out unclean spirits \[spiritus\] and deceiving Powers in order to worship them as gods.\' Later on he adds, \'the techniques \[known as\] \"Almadel\", \"notoria\", and \"Paulina\", the technique of making revelations, and more superstitions of this kind are types of this magic, and the more divine they seem to be to ignorant people\', (he says), \'the more destructive they are.\' Let those people take note of the opinion of their prince and standard-bearer on the subject of \'white\' magic-the simple truth from a liar. (St Augustine condemns this same theurgy in his book against the Manichaeans, The Advantage of Believing.) Add to these the fictitious planetary technique, inscribed on thin pieces of wood or metal, which was sent to Charlemagne by one of Bede\'s pupils-this is how these people lie and substitute Alkindi for Alcuin-useful (of course!) for obtaining a complete and more than natural understanding of the arts and sciences, and for achieving rank, riches, physical strength, enjoyment of love, etc.
[Page 2]

Secondly, in company with Catholics I say that God does not associate Himself with these magical operations, either on His own account or via good angels, any more than \[He does\] with anything else in which He engages as the universal cause. Consequently, I think that since evil spirits instituted all these \[operations\], they also carry them out and guide \[their performance\]. To think otherwise is an error. Proof of this lies first of all in case 26 in the various accounts of the canons provided by Gratian, and secondly in articles 9, 19, and 23 of the Articles of Paris. I quote: (i) \'That God is induced by magical practices and acts of harmful magic \[maleficia\] to force evil spirits to obey their incantations is an error;\' (ii) \'that good angels can be enclosed in stones, and that they can consecrate images or vestments, or do the other things involved in these practices, is an error and blasphemous;\' (iii) \'that some spirits are good and others omniscient and others are neither damned nor saved is an error.\"

Thirdly, \[my point\] is proved by these \[words\] of Arnobius in his Against the Heathen. \'Magicians not only have knowledge of evil spirits but accomplish whatever extraordinary thing they do by means of evil spirits. They perform conjuring-tricks because \[evil spirits\] breathe upon them and pour themselves into them,\' etc; and from Book 1, chapter 9 of The Frivolities of Courtiers by John of Salisbury, \'But long ago the holy Fathers ordered those who practise the more harmful conjuring-tricks and magical techniques, and different kinds of the disapproved \[form\] of astrology, to leave the church, because they knew that all these pieces of cunning, or rather noxious acts of harmful magic \[maleficia\] issued from an intimacy between evil spirits and human beings.\'

Next, it is proved by the argument that these spirits \[spiritus\] cannot be called \'good\' (i) because they order \[people\] to worship them as gods and make sacrifices to them, and this is an order good angels cannot give; (ii) these practices are directed as much to bringing death to others by means of robberies, murders, adulteries, etc. as to helping them; (iii) they blend together many lies and deceptions; (iv) the magicians are taught how to exercise command and compulsion over spirits, especially by making threats which are impossible and plainly ridiculous, (as Porphyrius says according to Eusebius), and none of this can apply to good angels at all. For this reason, it is clear Glykas should be read with care when he distinguishes magic from goetia on the grounds that magic comes from beneficent spirits \[genii\] and produces an outcome which is in some way good, while goetia comes from evil spirits and produces an outcome which is in some way bad.⁸ He has, you see, not only improperly made use of the generic term \'magic\' for the specific term \'theurgy\' but has also slipped into the error of those who support \'white\' magic and attribute the way it works to good angels. What is more, (let me issue this warning just once), this writer seems to attribute far too much to superstitious observations of portents, as do Constantine Manasses, \[Nicephorus\] Gregoras, and Nicetas \[Choniates\]. \'Palingenius Stellatus\' made the same mistake when, in Book 8 of his Zodiac which has been quite rightly proscribed, he thinks the air is full of good demons which he makes the originators of these practices and which, because he is too devoted to the lunacies of Plotinus and Iamblichus, he calls \'gods\'. He may not be a bad poet, but he is not a good Christian, in as much as he is more of a heretic than a Catholic, as his writings prove. Yet he ventured to dedicate that work to the Duke of Ferrara!⁹

A third error belongs to those who were of the opinion that magical effects take place through the agency of the souls of the dead. Catholic theologians have long exposed these people and have done so without difficulty because the reasons which are convincing in the case of good spirits \[spiritus\] are also convincing when it comes to the souls of the dead. Souls in Purgatory do not leave it except with God\'s permission to seek the prayers of the living. Finally, souls given over to everlasting torments cannot leave them by permission of licence or permission of evil spirits, in as much as by God\'s command they have been consigned to the very worst of prisons. It is therefore perfectly clear that the claims made by necromancers about summoning up souls with the help of a grimoire are fraudulent. If they did leave \[Hell\], they would do so at the command of the one God, but there is no reason God would order or permit this, and to think He would do so at the behest of magicians\' prayers and incantations is irreligious. So, the principal efficient cause of these practices is the Devil himself, and the second one is the human intelligence\'s innate quality which has been twisted out of shape as a result of the original Fall. Celio Calcagnini has described it to us very wittily, veiling \[his meaning\] with the garland of a merry fable in his Essay on Love Magic, using words I am not reluctant to write and, unless I am mistaken, you will take pleasure in reading.¹⁰ \'VAIN FUTILITY once conjoined with MARVEL in a furtive copulation and gave birth to a MAGIC with the name \'favourable\'. Dreading lest by chance TRUTH, (with which \[Vain Futility\] is perpetually engaged in hostilities, which she has also fought in close combat, and in which she has often been beaten), would kill off her offspring, handed it over, by conjugal agreement, to a married couple, SHAMELESSNESS and FEAR. But straight away they secretly laid it in the lap of INCOMPREHENSIBILITY to be brought up under the influence of the cradle-songs of CONJURING-TRICKS. \[Magic\] soon grew up and then, furnished with little wings, it flew off to the FORTRESS OF FOOLS, and there built a nest and gave birth to CREDULITY who, in gratitude for the kindnesses of her parent, nourishes \[Magic\] and loves her back\], as though \[Magic\] should shortly die if she did not.\'
[Page 3]

This is what he says, with equal acuity and truthfulness. Let us also proceed to fight on behalf of TRUTH and overcome VAIN FUTILITY and, once FEAR and SHAMELESSNESS have been put to flight, to measure the labyrinth of INCOMPREHENSIBILITY with the thread of real theology: and finally, once the cradlesongs of CONJURING-TRICKS have been brought to light, let us demolish the FORTRESS OF FOOLS and get rid of CREDULITY, who is so pernicious, from its nests: and may Almighty God grant us \[the ability\] to do this.

Book 2, Question 3

The different types of magic involving evil spirits, and the books which deal with it.

Since there is no such thing as theurgy or \'white\' magic, it follows that all this marvel-making magic is simply goetia and \'black\' \[magic\]. We usually call this \'Specific Magic\'. The Arch-magician divided it into two types, (a) the one whose practitioners, he says, surrender themselves to an evil spirit, sacrifice to him, and worship him, and (b) the one he would like to persuade us is free from a pact with evil spirits, but which gives them commands either by slight movements of the head and, through the power of divine names, binds them with an oath, then summons and constrains them \[to do the magician\'s will\]. He acknowledges that the former is forbidden by human and divine laws, is unspeakably wicked, and should be punished with every kind of fire; and he maintains that the latter does indeed accomplish what it claims to do, especially when it comes to constraining evil spirits, (which he later goes on to declare is an acceptable thing to do), but that it is exposed to the obvious dangers of delusion. His evidence in connection with the first is true. When it comes to the second, he lies: first when he denies that it depends on a covenant made with evil spirits, because in fact it is always made worse by an overt or tacit pact, and secondly when he maintains that evil spirits are constrained, (about which I shall speak later.)¹¹

People claim that the discoverer of this forbidden magic was one Mercurius, (which is contradicted by Symmachus, Prudentius, and \[John of Salisbury in Policraticus Book 1, chapter 9.) Others \[say it was\] someone called \'Zabulus\', but I think he was simply the evil spirit to whom St Cyprian and other Fathers applied this name. Then they praise a teacher, one Barnabas from Cyprus. (\[The Cypriots\] have fabricated him as an insult to St Barnabas the Apostle in order to flatter their ugly prostitute.) Likewise, people reveal, in an equally mendacious boast, that they have the books of Adam, Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Paul, Cyprian, Honorius, Albertus Magnus, and others, and in a blasphemous lie they say that the contents of these books were handed down by Adam\'s guardian angel, Raziel, and revealed by Raphael, Tobias\'s companion.¹³ They also pretend that Solomon was the author of The Little Key, (\[a claim\] which Battista Segni refutes very well in chapter 7 of his book Real Christian Concern), and thrust \[in our direction\] another huge volume divided into seven books, which is filled with sacrifices and incantations to evil spirits.

The Jews and Arabs in Spain used to leave this book to their descendants as an heirloom, and by its means used to effect a number of remarkable and incredible things. But Inquisitors of the Faith have quite justifiably burned as many copies as they have been able to find-and would they had been able to lay their hands on the last copy! I scarcely have any doubt that one fell into the hands of Johannes Trithemius and that it was from this that he got both the gestation of and material for his Secret Writing \[\'Steganographia\'\] which is crammed full of danger and superstition; and I suspect that the reputation of this work, which has not yet been added to \[the list of books prohibited by the Church, happened because while the book was still not yet in print it fell into the hands of \[only a\] few people. Moreover, when all books of magic were prohibited, this one which, among others, deludes the household \[of faith\], should have been considered as having been prohibited as well.
[Page 4]

I can say the same of Agrippa\'s Three Books of A Philosophy which has been kept Secret, and of the fourth Book, the most pernicious of all, which was added and published separately later: and about Thomas of York, Pietro d\'Abano, and the poisonous stuff \[produced\] by similar people, and a book on magical technique \[artis grimoyriae\] which teaches \[its readers\] how to evoke the dead, and was going the rounds in our fathers\' lifetime. I consider that all these people\'s wicked opinions, and also what they say about those older \[topics\], owe their value to the work of the Arch-magician, and one has to believe that his students cannot be allowed to escape the influence of their teacher in what they say about magic. This is why he writes as follows: \'These books openly publish, for the person who gives them careful attention, a list of their precepts, the ritual, the customary words and type of characters to be used, the way they should be put together, and the silly way \[the words\] should be spoken. They contain nothing but nonsense and deceit, and in later times have been assembled by the most desperate authors of \[people\'s\] ruination from a number of unholy practices mixed together with the ceremonies of our religion and sown with a good many unknown names and signs, in order to terrify the uneducated and the simple-minded. \[They are also aimed at\] those who have been rendered irrational by stupidity and those who have not had a decent education\'. The wretched man, while being aware of what is better clung, right up to the end of his life, to what was worse.

Book 2, Question 4

The basis of this kind of magic: a pact, whether explicit or implicit.

Conclusion 1: All magical working rests for its foundation on a pact made between the magicians and an evil spirit. Consequently, any time a magician wants to accomplish anything, he is constrained explicitly or implicitly by this prop to his craft to demand that the evil spirit abide by the contract. This is proved first of all by the authority of the \[Church\] Fathers. St Cyprian says that \[magicians\] have a covenant with an evil spirit. Gratian records the words of St Augustine in the text of his Decretals as follows. \'All practices of this kind, either of frivolous or harmful superstition, have been created from a noxious partnership, a pact so to speak of untrustworthy and deceitful friendship\'¹⁶

Secondly, it is proved by civil law in the form of an Imperial decree. \'Many people have used magical techniques to throw the elements into confusion. They do not hesitate to undermine the life of the innocent and dare to summon-this is the correct reading-¹⁷ the spirits of the dead and agitate them to that someone can destroy his enemies by means of their wicked practices. May a deadly pestilence annihilate these people, because they are alien to \[God\'s\] creation\'.

Thirdly, it is decreed as an item of belief by the Articles of the University of Paris in the following words: \[To say that\] entering into a tacit or overt pact with evil spirits is not idolatry or a kind of idolatry is an error, and we mean that an implicit pact exists in every superstitious practice for whose effect one cannot reasonably look to God or Nature.¹⁸

Fourthly, we are persuaded of its \[existence\] by reason because many wicked people desire this and so does the evil spirit, and \[people\'s\] strength does not overcome it. The prophet Isaiah tells us this. According to him, irreligious people say, \'We have struck a bargain with death and have made a pact with Hell\', \[28.15\]. St Thomas \[Aquinas\] says this probably refers to magicians, and so did Pope John XXII in his decretal against magicians, beginning \'On the subject of mirrors\', and Pope Sixtus V in his Bull against astrology. So, the wicked do this willingly, no less so than the evil spirit himself who dared offer Christ the Lord Himself the terms of a pact. \'All these things\', he said, \'I shall give you if you will prostrate yourself and worship me\', \[Matthew 4.9\]. Here one can see the pact belonging to an unspoken contract-I give on the understanding that you do. Hence nowadays the Devil says to magicians, \'If you devote yourself to me, I shall avenge you, I shall enrich you\', etc. which is the entire formula of a pact between \[sworn\] brothers.
[Page 5]

Fifthly, as I said, these things take place through the action of evil spirits, not the power of the magicians, and since human beings cannot compel the evil spirits to do them, it follows that the evil spirits make haste \[to do them\] because they want to. Evil spirits, however, pursue a human being out of sheer hatred, so one cannot imagine they make haste without wanting something in return. They exact some kind of price for their effort. Consequently, it is clear that this kind of covenant and association is like that between two brigands. One strolls about openly in a wood while the other lurks secretly in an ambush. The former attracts the attention of the latter with a special hiss or signal, and the latter treacherously shoots a traveller with an arrow. Often the former does not see this and does not know which weapon it was that inflicted death, and yet he agrees to the unfortunate \[traveller\'s\] murder. The magician is like the first robber, the evil spirit like the second. The situation is rather like that in which powerful individuals who are greedy for revenge attach to themselves men who are quick with a dagger. They give these men a pre-arranged nod as a signal of the person they want killed and when \[they want it done\].

Finally theologians, older as well as more recent, are in agreement on this point, as are legal experts and physicians, (\[Battista\] Codronchi, Illnesses caused by Poisons and Poisonous Magic, Book 1, and \[Andrea\] Cesalpino, A Peripatetic Investigation of Evil Spirits.) The matter is rendered absolutely certain by the remarkably unanimous confession of workers of harmful magic \[malefici\] and wise-women \[sagae\] throughout the whole of Europe and \[by the fact that\] every age is in agreement, and even though Lucan was a sceptic, he was aware of this kind of compact. But he was deceived by it, because he thought the evil spirit was bound by the pact.

\'Why is it the gods take this trouble to pay heed to chants and herbs, And are afraid to take no notice? Which pact Binds the gods under an obligation to its provisions? Must they obey, or do they take pleasure \[in obeying\]? Are they being rewarded simply because of a sense of duty about which we know nothing, Or have they exerted their influence because of silent threats? Do those \[threats\] Have authority over all the gods, or do these imperious chants Have one particular god who can compel the world By whatever kind of compulsion is exerted over him?\' \[Pharsalia 6.492499\].

Only the wise-women\'s \[sagarum\] protector \[Johann Weyer\] is resistant to this as he fills his pages with slight, worthless arguments, and in consequence I think they should be treated with contempt and consigned to silence rather than rebutted, most especially since some people have been more diligent than reluctant to do this.

Conclusion 2: The evil spirit is at liberty to fulfil this pact, or to cheat. This is proved by reason and experience. Reason tells, us that an evil spirit cannot be compelled by a human being to stand by his promises, and experience tells us he is a complete liar and very keen to deceive. Consequently, he rarely does what he has promised. But when he does stand by his promises, which he does occasionally, he does so not under compulsion but of his own accord, with the crafty intention (i) of keeping his hold over the magicians he has bound to him this way, and (ii) of enticing others and persuading them that the power they want lies in frivolities of this kind.

Conclusion 3: This kind of pact has two sides to it, the one explicit, the other implicit, but the indication of each of them is not the same in all circumstances. The following should be noted by way of explanation. To start with, one should be aware that the explicit pact works in three ways. The first involves various ritual observances during which loyalty and homage are promised to the evil spirit himself who appears visibly in some kind of physical shape in front of witnesses. Caesarius of Heisterbach tells the story of a nobleman from the territory of Liège who made a pact of this kind.²² The evil spirit, however, was heard speaking but was not seen, and at this point the young man, along with everything else he did, was ill-advised enough to deny his Creator with a gesture of renunciation and do homage to the devil. He, in his turn, promised \[the young man\] riches and honours. So because I feel friendly towards the reader, I also make a solemn promise that he will bring back abundant fruit from his taking the trouble to read this. On this subject, too, I should make reference to what Archdeacon Theophilus did, according to Sigebert. \'In order to recover his position, he sought help from the Prince of evil spirits, who ordered him to deny Christ, the Son of God, and His mother Mary, along with every tenet of Christianity, to confirm this denial in writing, to sign what he had written, to hand over the signed document to him, and to bind himself to his service\'. In the latter instance, the witness was a magician, in the former the Superintendent of Iniquity.²³
[Page 6]

Sometimes they do this via a little book of humble requests which they present to the Devil. In our own day, for example, magicians from Mantes-laJolie in Normandy, wrote a little book which they were going to offer to the Sibyls, the guardians of necromantic magic. Briefly, it said that (i) they begged the Ladies to deign to consecrate the \[magicians\'\] books of magic so that evil spirits \[spiritus\] would obey them quickly in every way in conformity with the formulae of invocation contained in the books, and that when they were invoked they would appear to them, without doing them harm, in the shape of a good-looking human being, and that they would not have to make any circle or enter houses or go into the fields; (ii) that the Sibyls would stamp their sign or character on the books, (there were three of them), so that the books would have more effectiveness and dominance over the foresaid spirits \[spiritus\]; (iii) that the petitioners were to be kept safe from judges\' traps and the punishment \[they inflict\]; (iv) that everything they started and their endeavours to get a friendly reception at the courts of princes were to be successful and prosper, and that they were to make money by gambling whenever they wanted; (v) that their enemies should not be able to do them harm. In return for these \[requests\], they promised in their turn that, on the very day their books were consecrated, they would regard the foresaid Sibyls as their mistresses and princes in perpetuity and offer them an individual soul every year for as long as they lived, (that is, they would murder and sacrifice a human being, or certainly initiate him into their ritual of unbelief.) But according to their binding agreement, the Sibyls were to provide these people in good faith with what they had demanded. (They were all burned in Paris, along with their books. \[Pierre\] Crespet tells this story in his book The Hatred of Satan, discourse 15.

The second way \[the pact works\] is like the first one in every regard except that it is done without witnesses. The third is carried out by a deputy, (that is, a magician acting as a third person), because the person making the covenant is too afraid to look at or converse with the evil spirit. \[Paolo\] Grillando, question 3, calls this third kind \'\[Tacit\', because although this declaration is made to someone other than the evil spirit, it is still clearly also made in the name of the evil spirit, as is obvious from what Grillando tells us in question 3, note 1 ff. Perhaps the less common form applies to the explicit pact in the example of a German woman who leaped backwards out of a large basin she was using as a bath and began to cry out that the distance she jumped away from Christ was the same distance she was approaching the evil spirit. (I shall speak about this at greater length in Book 5).

All these pacts have certain things in common. (i) There is a denial of the Faith and of Christianity, withdrawing one\'s obedience from God, repudiating the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and on top of this attacking her loudly with insults. Blasphemously and contemptuously, they are accustomed to call her a big red-headed beanpole. So we have, \'The Devil comes and removes the word from their heart so that they may not be saved, (Luke 8.12), that is, he removes the true Faith and acknowledgement of it because he is canvassing for divine honours, (see St Augustine, The City of God, Book 10, chapter 20 and Against Faustus, Book 20, chapter 22.) This is why he forces \[people\] first of all to renounce the baptism whereby someone has been consecrated to the true God, and why, in his book on the destruction of the world, Hippolytus the Martyr writes that the evil spirit will force someone to say, \'I deny the Creator of heaven and earth. I deny baptism. I deny the worship I have been accustomed to offer God. I begin to cleave to you. I believe in you\'.²⁶ This is why the evil spirit jabs their forehead with his nail, pretending to scrape away the oil and destroy the mark of baptism. (ii) He also pretends to wash them with a new baptismal purification. Tertullian was not unaware of this.
[Page 7]

In his book on baptism he writes, \'Here, too, we recognise the Devil\'s eager exertions when, in emulation of God, he confers baptism on his \[adherents\]\'. (iii) So once the person has renounced his former name, he is given a new one, (as Della Rovere from Cuneo was called \'Goat-beard\'. Don\'t you recognise a figurative example in those limbs of Satan?)² The Egyptian Pharaoh changed Joseph\'s name (Genesis \[41\].45), but Holy Scripture never calls him by that name. Nebuchadnezzar imposed other names on Daniel and his companions (Daniel 3), but Daniel always calls himself \'Daniel\', and the three men in the fiery furnace, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael, sing \'You are blessed\' to the Lord, saying, \'Truly, 0 God, we are your soldiers and not those of an earthly king. We have given the name to you, not to a tyrant\'.

\(iv\) He compels them to renounce the god-fathers and god-mothers \[they had\] at baptism and confirmation, and assigns them other, new ones, because those who undertake this task behave like the sponsors of the Faith and, (as one has to believe), are required to teach their spiritual children.

\(v\) They give the Devil a piece torn from their clothing because the Devil is eager to lay claim to something which belongs to them personally-one of their spiritual gifts of grace, \[such as\] their faith and their baptism: a part of their body, \[such as\] their blood, as in the rites of Baal, (3 Kings 18.\[29\]): one of their possessions from Nature, \[such as\] their daughters, (as I shall point out in its place): one of their material possessions, \[such as\] a scrap of clothing, perhaps because they are accustomed to cast their clothes beneath the feet of their king as a recognition of his lordship? (4 Kings 9.\[13\] and Matthew 21. \[8\].)

\(vi\) They swear an oath to the evil spirit on a circle drawn on the ground. Is this because a circle, which lacks a beginning and end, is a symbol of the Godhead and the earth is God\'s footstool? Certainly \[the evil spirit\] would have them believe he is the lord of heaven and earth. Or is it because a circle, which lacks any angles at all, is the opposite \[shape\] of a cross, which is full of angles? Certainly \[the evil spirit\] hates the cross on which, he recalls, he was utterly defeated, and which gives him much grief. This is why he loves the opposite shape. You can find, among magical sigils, a cross placed in the middle of a circle, as though it were its prisoner. The Apostate, (as the theologian Gregory \[Naziazen\] indicates in his Against Julian), who was utterly devoted to magical things, used to interpret the sigil this way in order to presume that the sign of the cross should be, to put it plainly and briefly, trampled on and effaced.

\(vii\) They ask the evil spirit to delete them from the book of life and inscribe them in the book of death. For example, we read that the magicians from Avignon were inscribed in a pitch-black book. (viii) They promise \[to make\] sacrifices, as did \[the magicians\] from Mantes la Jolie about whom I spoke a little earlier, and certain witches \[striges\] promise to murder a little child every month or fortnight by making it lose strength, (that is, by sucking the life out of it.) See \[Bartolomeo della\] Spina, Night-Flying Witches, chapter 2.

\(ix\) They are obliged to pay something to their little masters, the evil spirits, every year so that they can either buy off their fear of being beaten or the distress of these payments to which they are liable under the terms of their pact. That \'something\', too, is not licit unless it is jet black.

(Nicolas Rémy proves this with many examples in his Worship of Evil Spirits, Book 1, chapter (x) \[The evil spirit\] usually imprints his brand or mark \[stigma vel characterem\] on some part of the body, sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, quite frequently hidden away, as though \[these people\] were runaway slaves whom he had bought and marked as his, this mark being insensible when pierced with a needle. You will not be surprised if you remember that in the last days Antichrist will imprint the Mark of the Beast (the Devil) on the hand or forehead of his partners, as St John bears witness in his revelation, (Apocalypse 13.16). This should be understood in the literal sense of the real character or mark of the Beast, as Primasius \[of Hadrumetum\] and \[Ambrosius\] Ansbertus say in their commentaries on the Apocalypse, and St Hippolytus in his book on the end of the world.³² The evil spirit has been accustomed to do this from the beginning of the world, because this unutterable wretch loves to imitate God who signs His people with the sign of circumcision in the Old Testament and with the sign of the cross in the New, a sign which \[Gregory\] Naziazen and St Jerome think was the successor to the sign of circumcision. Likewise, the Devil has signed with a particular sign, from their cradles, those heretics who are mixed up in magical practices.
[Page 8]

The authors who tell us this are well worth taking seriously. Irenaeus recorded, \'The followers of Carpocrates make use of magical techniques and incantations, potions and love spells, and familiar spirits who send dreams, and every other pieces of mischief, saying they have the power to lord it over the princes and structures of this world. On a mark which is branded \[on someone he adds, \'But others from among them brand their disciples on the back of the right ear-lobe\'³³ The evil spirit has usually marked \[people\] on the forehead, as Tertullian points out when he writes, Certain passages of Scripture are interpreted\] by the Devil, of course, whose business it is to falsify the truth. He even imitates the divine sacraments during secrets acts when idols are worshipped. He himself baptises certain people, especially those who believe in him and are his faithful \[adherents\] and promises them expiation of their sins. This is how he still consecrates people to Mithras. This is how he still marks his soldiers on their forehead.³⁴ Who were they? The followers of Basilides, who used to worship Abraxas. According to St Jerome, Abraxas is the same as Mithras, \[Commentary on Amos 5.9-10\], and so the origin of this mark is as old \[as that\]. I shall say more about this later.

\(xi\) Those who have been marked in this fashion make many promises very similar to those of Les Gueux of our times during their secret rites:³⁵ that they will never worship the Eucharist; that they will always be insulting and abusive to the Blessed Virgin and the relics of the saints, not only in word but in deed as well; that they will trample underfoot, spit upon, and break into pieces any relics and images of the saints; that they will refrain from making the sign of the cross, and using holy water, blessed salt, wax \[objects\] and relics blessed and consecrated by the Church; that they will never make a complete confession of their sins to a priest; that they will keep hidden, by a stubborn silence, their traffic with the evil spirit; that on the appointed days they will fly to meetings if they can; that they will not be sluggish in carrying out what has to be done there; and finally, that they will bins to the evil spirit\'s service as many people as they can. The Devil in his turn promises he will always be with them, will satisfy their desires in this world, and will bless them after death. These pacts do not bind both sides equally. The situation of the contracting parties is entirely unbalanced, because the humans are handing themselves over to eternal death and through sin are being made actual slaves of the Devil; and until such time as the demon-possessed come to God\'s grace again, they are subjected to the most hideous servitude.³⁶ Even so, humans acquire no right and no power over the evil spirit from this pact, and no \[special\] capability at all enters into the signs the pact obliges them to use. The crafty fellow pretends he is being compelled and that, of his own accord, he is carrying out whatever this kind of magic professes \[to do\].

The very serious mortal sin of idolatry takes place in these \[versions\] of the pact because it explicitly exhibits to created beings the cult of idol-worship. If magicians cast the Faith from their mind, they are apostates. If, on the other hand, they do not cast the Faith out entirely, but simply believe that they owe the Devil this worship, or that they can do what the Catholic faith says they cannot do, they are heretics; and if they \[merely\] pretend to do all these things, they are neither apostates nor heretics, but still commit a very grave mortal sin because they are committing an act of idolatry of their own free will and accord. Even if they have been forced by the evil spirit and have done this out of extreme fear, (as sometimes happens), they are still committing a less serious mortal sin against the profession of Faith. In these explicit pacts, which have to be distinguished from one another, one finds plain evidence from the solemn rituals \[these people use\]. \[Paolo\] Grillando has described these very clearly and, from the confession of a single witch \[strix\] has given very strong confirmation of what I have said, and I shall not hesitate to copy down what he says in \[his\] question.
[Page 9]

\'This woman, in hope of saving her life, gave an account of everything from beginning to end. This acknowledgement of her requires individual headings to express it all. First, she said that her \[Novice\] Mistress brought her in front of the judgement-seat of their prince, he being the Devil in the form of a king seated upon a throne of majesty. The \[Novice\] Mistress had instructed her beforehand what she should do, so she came forward and first was obliged to deny her baptism and abandon all the teachings of the Christian faith\'. (Here you have apostasy.) \'Then she had to cast aside all the Church\'s sacraments, and trample underfoot the cross and images of the Blessed Virgin Mary and other saints.\' (Here you have sacrilege.) \'They do not do these last in front of the Devil but do them elsewhere later on. It is enough that they promise to do them\'. (Here you have the profession). \'Then she made her vow by means of a solemn engagement, \[putting her hands\] in the prince\'s hands. She vowed and promised she would always be faithful to him, be obedient to him, and obey all his commandments\'. (Here you have the vow.)

\'Then, in the midst of her oath-taking, she touched \[some\] characters written on the outside of a large book containing pages which were hidden away, and did homage or perpetual vassalage\', (here you have homage,) \'\[saying\] she would never return to the faith of Christ, or keep God\'s commandments, but that she would pay attention only to those \[issued\] by the prince himself, and that in future she would be obedient to him and could come every time when summoned to \[his\] revels and assemblies. \[She also promised\] to do what the other women did during those \[assemblies\], and also that she would be present at their nocturnal sacrifices and would \[make\] the customary prayers and attend the ceremony of adoration\'. (Here you have idol-madness.) \'She would fulfil, to the best of her ability, whatever vows \[the prince\] might happen to put in front of her and bring as many people as she could to \[make\] this same profession\'. (Here you have the declaration.) \'On his part, however, the prince himself, with surpassing effrontery, promised to give this woman in front of him everlasting happiness, grandiose things, immeasurable things, and whatever pleasures she wanted to have in this world, and that at long last, after this life, she would obtain greater gifts \[than these\]\'. This is what Grillando says.

Jean del Vaulx from Stavelot, a seer \[sortiarius\], used to add further that the Devil had convinced him that after this life seers would be like evil spirits and would be changed into evil spirits and be given lordship in the air. Anyone easily realises that these things go back to the twaddle \[one finds\] in the works of Origen.

The implicit pact is of two kinds. First, when someone knowingly and willingly uses those superstitious signs usually employed by magicians, which he has got either from books or from conversations with magicians or other people. This, too, is a mortal sin, because in no way is it legitimate knowingly to enter into any fellowship, directly or indirectly, with vicious spirits \[spiritus\], as theologians and canon lawyers agree. If, however, anyone were to have got some natural remedy from the books of, or conversations with, magicians, was not party to any pact, he could legitimately use a remedy of this kind. This type of pact is easily recognised. The second type of implicit pact is when someone uses signs, not knowing they are magical, because he is unaware that these wicked things have been created by an evil spirit. This usually happens to those people who, in good faith, read superstitious books, thinking they are by reputable natural philosophers or physicians. The same applies when they are told about them by those who have a reputation of being good people and true to the Faith. In the case of private individuals, this is either not a sin at all or a very slight one, provided two conditions obtain: (i) if one can prove their ignorance \[of such things\]-for example, they are people who are not considered to have any knowledge of this as opposed to those who could be considered to be in possession of such knowledge, such as Church ministers, confessors, the heads of religious houses, and Doctors \[of Divinity or Canon Law\]. Those \[private\] individuals are, for the most part, labouring under a bone-idle, crass ignorance. Their sin, however, is less serious than that of those who knowingly make drawings \[of the signs\]; (ii) if the person who does not know what these things are is willing to give up this kind of superstition once he has been admonished, because after admonition he cannot plead ignorance. \[At that point\] he becomes contumacious, and because that is serious, the magnitude of the offence increases. This second kind of pact is very difficult to distinguish from an effect which is natural or miraculous, \[but\] I shall talk about this in the next question.
[Page 10]

Meanwhile, if you ask what persuades an evil spirit to \[make\] a pact of this kind and be obedient or submissive, it appears that workers of harmful magic \[malefici\] and the evil spirit have something in common which gives rise to a kind of intimacy rather like friendship. Little by little from this is born mutual trust. The trust of the lesser party creates a certain boldness and insolence, like that of imperial command, in the greater, and in the greater a willingness in some measure to do what his fellow-signatory commands. Thus, it turns out that the worker of harmful magic relies on the evil spirit when he thinks he is giving the orders, and the evil spirit pretends to recognise \[the magical worker\'s\] authority. Abbot Trithemius explains this very well at length in question 5 of his Book of Eight Questions, but in it he makes a different point, because he thinks that the evil spirit is willing to gratify his slaves by obeying them. Whatever the pact may be, he hates them with the utmost bitterness, and the consequence is that the more strongly and straitly he ensnares them, the more certainly and quickly he binds and destroys them.

Finally, one must understand most especially that it is a very serious sin to covenant with evil spirits by means of any pact, as I pointed out some time ago in my Admonitions. Here and now I shall simply insert and add many other points which, along with other people, Sébastien Michaëlis has written, most authoritatively, in chapter 7 of his Pneumologie, against those who make excuses for magicians, if they do no harm to others, on the grounds that such defenders of magicians maintain it is not wicked at all to use evil spirits\' help for good, especially when one is in command of them, as we read Christ and the Apostles were.

\[Michaëlis\] maintains the contrary, and is absolutely right to do so-that it is the height of wickedness to argue this way, and that this is the sign of the mind of a complete fool and someone who despises God, as Proverbs 18.3 says, \'When an irreligious person is deeply mired\' (in sin), \'he feels contempt, because in this state he mocks everything. If anyone says the punishments of Hell are to be feared and that the impenitent should be damned for eternity, \[the irreligious person\] laughs and says one should not be afraid of Hell at all, that God does not want the death of a sinner, and did not create a human being so that he should perish, etc. \[Michaëlis says\] that in Theodoret\'s opinion these people are undoubtedly worse than evil spirits themselves because \'evil spirits believe and tremble\', \[James 2.19\] \[whereas\] these people do not believe and do not tremble. They are also worse than heretics because when St Athanasius asked the chief of the heretics, Arius, what he thought-does someone who worships Satan do well or ill?-Arius replied that such a person is without religion and without God, has no common sense, and does not deserve to be called a human being. (St Athanasius during disputations at the Council of Nicaea.) This, spoken by a liar, is most accurately said and applies to seers \[sortiarios\] because these people worship Satan.

But Christ and the Apostles commanded Satan and told him what they wanted him to do. Why can we not do this as well? I could say we are not allowed to imitate whatever we like of what was done by the saints or God. When it comes to divine matters, you see, we must believe certain things, such as the Incarnation, transubstantiation, the Trinity, and Purgatory; we should honour certain similar things with our wonder, such as the miracles of Christ our Lord and holy people; and we should imitate certain things, such as those which are pertinent to the way we conduct our morals and our life, things which Christ commanded us to learn, such as gentleness, humility, and love. (On this point, see what St Paul said, \'Be imitators of me as I also am \[an imitator\] of Christ\', \[1 Corinthians n.1\]). A wish to imitate the wonderful things I mentioned is \[the mark\] of the very arrogant, stupid disposition of someone who wants and strives to be like God in omnipotence and omniscience. Such people imitate the Devil who wanted to be like the Most High, since they want to compel evil spirits through their command, as Christ did, \[and\] since such people want to learn secrets and future events from these \[evil spirits\], they are like Adam and Eve who sought a knowledge similar to that of God. God forbade this when He said, \'I shall not give my glory to someone else\', \[Isaiah 42.8\]. But such people say, \'I shall usurp it, even if you do not want me to\'. Christians in the old days used to exercise authority over evil spirits, (as Tertullian says), \'not by means of an operation to invite them in, but by dominating them in order to get rid of them\'.
[Page 11]

Therefore, my answer is that those who have a pact with evil spirits not only do not imitate the Lord and the Apostles, but clearly do the opposite, because \[the Lord and the Apostles\] were not in the habit of summoning evil spirits, did not consult them, and did not make use of their assistance. No, they would rebuke them, banish them, torture them, and even when \[the spirits\] spoke the truth would order them to fall silent. They would treatment just as though they were extremely hostile enemies, and they knew that they are our adversaries and range about like ravening lions, seeking out a soul they can devour. From the beginning of the world, God has set in place enmities between a human being and the Devil, (Genesis 3.15). These people enter into a treaty with God\'s foe and sworn enemy. After Job has spoken about the great malice of the evil spirit, he ends, Remember the war. Don\'t say anything further\', (Job 40.27), as if to say, \'Don\'t boast in vain or delude yourself about an armistice or striking a peace with him. Be on your guard, break your fast, stand ready for action, and await the signal for battle\'. God, as the one who ratifies treaties, has declared war.⁴⁶ There is perpetual warfare between God and the Devil because, \'The pride of those who hate God is always climbing higher\', \[Psalm 73.23\], and the Devil is correctly named \'Satan\', that is \'adversary\'. Consequently we, who are God\'s vassals, cannot make peace or have dealings with His enemy. St Paul declares, \'I do not want you to be the allies of evil spirits\', (1 Corinthians 10.21).

We made this promise during the sacrament of baptism, and are bound by this oath \[we took.\] The priest asks in the name of the Church and our godparents answer for us again and again, \'We renounce Satan\', (the adversary), \'and his vainglorious displays\'. Christians have been given the power to trample upon snakes and St Paul promises, \'God will grind down Satan beneath your feet\', \[Romans 16.20\]. Why do these people fall prostrate at \[Satan\'s\] feet? The Church has been promised the power to work miracles in the name of Christ and to cast out evil spirits. Why do \[these people\] seek refuge in the name and invocation of Beelzebub? So since this war was enjoined \[on us\] in the beginning, at the foundation of the world, and was renewed by the Apostles\' trumpet when the Christian Church began, and we swore a solemn oath and promised \[to continue it\] when we were regenerated in the Church, doesn\'t it follow that the person who makes any pact or cultivates intimate friendship with the enemies of the Church and of God is guilty of treachery, desertion, and apostasy no less than if a monks abandons his profession and his vows, a soldier deserts to the enemy, or a Christian takes himself off to Mahommedanism, Judaism, or some other heresy? All these are sins against the First Commandment, and therefore quite rightly I consider them to be very serious because that \[commandment\] is first in importance as well as in order. Because of their aim, the commandments of the first category are more important than those of the second, and among the three \[commandments\] of the first category, the first is superior to the others. The third \[cayegory\] deals principally with outward worship of God, the second with the words by which one must show Him honour, and the first with the love and inward fidelity one owes to God by virtue of religion-theosebeia or latria.⁴⁷ Consequently, since this virtue is the most acceptable of all to God, the sin which is its opposite must be particularly hateful \[to Him\], and so God added a penalty to this first commandment when He testifies that He is powerful and jealous, and that He will avenge this sin as far as the third and fourth generation, and calls those who transgress this commandment people who hate Him, (Exodus 20.5). So serious, then, is the sin of covenanting with an evil spirit.
[Page 12]

Moreover, such pacts are useless and worthless. The evil spirit never keeps his word and does not think he is bound by any promise. He dared to lie to Christ when he said, \'All this I shall give you if you prostrate yourself and worship me\', that is, revere yourself. Didn\'t another \[evil spirit\] promise Cyprian, the magician, that he would enjoy Justina? What did \[the spirit\] actually do?⁴⁸ What madness it is to expect the truth from the father of lying! Didn\'t Jesus say of him, \'There is no truth in him. When he speaks, he speaks a lie in accordance with his nature because he is a liar and the father \[of lying\]\'? (John 8.44). Therefore, you covenant with him in vain. He is a mixture, fused from lying and treachery. Believe \[St John\]. You are never going to find anyone \[the evil spirit\] has never deceived. In Book 8 of his Against Celsus, Origen shrewdly writes, \'One can assume that since evil spirits are wicked, they will not keep their word and pledge even to their own worshippers\'. Yes indeed, one can not only assume it, one can take for granted they will not keep \[their word\], because they are liars and pursue human beings with an irreconcilable hatred which they have never abated since the time of their fall, and never will diminish or abate. If God were to allow it, they would quickly destroy every mortal being. But because they see they are not allowed to do so, by using many different ways of alluring \[people\] into sin, they aim continually at the death of the soul, and this is how they try to make sure that human beings fall from blessedness.

The magnitude of their hatred is clear from the vehemence and bitterness of the tortures and hardships they have inflicted, and from the number of times God has given them limited permission \[to afflict Job, Sarah\'s husbands, St Antony, and countless others. Job tells us about the persistence of their hatred in 41.15 when he says, \'His heart will be hardened like a stone, and will have pain inflicted upon it, as though it were a smith\'s anvil, and in John 8.44 our Saviour explains the personal spirit \[genius\] of the father by reference to what his children do. \'You are \[the children\] of your father, the Devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s wishes. He was a murderer from the beginning\'. By these words He points out that this endeavour \[of the Devil\] is perpetual, and since he cannot \[achieve\] his end by overt force he proceeds by trickery and a semblance of kindliness, as St Athanasius, writing to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, very clearly tells us in his Against Arius, at the beginning of Oration 1. So those who trust \[an evil spirit\] are stupid and forget what the Holy Spirit warns us in Job 40.22-that it is impossible for anyone to submit himself to that lofty degree of arrogance. \'Will he multiply his prayers to you or speak soft \[words\] to you?\' that is, sincerely and with good faith to fulfil \[his promise to you. \'Will he make a covenant with you, and will you accept him as though he were going to be your slave for ever?\' \[40.23\]. He will dissemble and make promises but will not fulfil what he has promised. Therefore, this indicates that these \[promises\] should be regarded as áδúvata \[incapable of fulfilment\]. He cannot be tied to you by any bonds; he cannot be enclosed by any bars. \'Will you sport with him as \[you do with\] a bird, or will you hem him in with your slave-girls?\' \[40.24\]. That is to say, he will obey a human being who has preferred to do without eternal blessedness rather than obey God and worship the Word made human.
[Page 13]

Finally, these pacts and this intimacy with an evil spirit are not only useless and worthless. They are dangerous and baleful beyond measure. St Leo \[the Great says that evil spirits\' favours cause more hurt than any wounds and that it is best to merit their hatred than to be at peace with them, (Sermon 19 on the Lord\'s Passion). Reason confirms that nothing is more deadly than the death of the soul. They incur this by these pacts and this intimacy, and not only \[the death\] of the soul, but often of the body as well. I shall illustrate this now with one example, and with more on another occasion. In Book 1, chapter 9 of his Worship of Evil Spirits, Nicolas Rémy describes Théodore Maillot as follows.

\'When he was an old man, he obtained the governorship of a province in a huge kingdom. \[This province\] comes under the jurisdiction of Lorraine. While he was still a young man, he was desperate to marry a young woman from a very splendid family. All hope of his being able to achieve this had been torn from him and snatched away because he had no money and was of humble stock. He was an apprentice engaged in trade which, at that time, meant he was low-born and despised. So, he saw no sufficiently honourable way of even making his love known. Therefore, as people in hopeless situations, when expectation itself deserts them, easily turn to any kind of plan and embrace it without any thought whether they should shun it or follow it, Maillot went to a fellow-servant from Germany \[because\] he had been told that this man had an evil spirit who was prepared to be compliant in every respect. He opened up to him and told him what was making him ill and begged him not to begrudge him a remedy if he could provide him with one. His kindness, \[he said\], would not go unrewarded. The German willingly seized his opportunity because, in accordance with his pact, in a few days\' time he either had to free and disengage himself from the evil spirit by bringing him someone else who would transfer this debt to himself or incur another one, or be put to death and killed at the hands \[of the evil spirit\] who would twist and break his neck, (because this stipulation had been added to the pact.)

So, in order to carry out his plan, he agreed they should meet the following day at daybreak in an out-of-the-way room which would be locked and have its shutters drawn. They had scarcely got there when the doors suddenly opened and in came an elegant young woman with a generous figure. (The evil spirit wanted to show himself in this form first so that Maillot would not become terrified at his frightening appearance.) She announced she was the woman who would easily get him the marriage he wanted so badly, provided he was willing to follow the instructions she would give him. He was all agog and eagerly waited to hear whatever she would tell him \[to do\]. The first thing she started with was an instruction to abstain from theft, drunkenness, lust, blasphemy, and every other sin which defiles the soul. \[Then she said\] he should cultivate devout behaviour, support the needy from his resources, and weaken himself twice a week by fasting. He was not to neglect \[the Church\'s\] feast-days, he should pray every day, and he must unremittingly attend to all the things it was proper and fitting for a Christian to do. If he was willing to bind himself by a formal vow \[to do\] all this, the result would be that there would be no difficulty in his obtaining the marriage he wanted. Once she had said this and appointed a day by which she would receive his answer, she left hastily. Maillot, who could see that such holy and respectable conditions made a benefit of such importance to him obtainable, now began to think there was no point in delaying and that he should gratefully and willingly accept \[her proposal\]. But while he was giving the matter more and more thought and being driven hither and thither in different ways between hope and fear, a member of the household, who was a priest, guessed from the expression on his face that he was concealing something which was perplexing him. He approached him gently, found out what was troubling him, and with his advice prevailed on Maillot not to stoop to any further conversation with the evil spirit. The German was thus deceived in his expectation, and it was not long before he paid the penalty laid down in his pact, because not many days later, on a level open road, he tumbled from his horse, fell heavily to the ground, and was found to have died in an instant\'. This is what Rémy says.
[Page 14]

Book 2, Question 5

What are the signs by which one can recognise the effects of magic, which is dependent on a pact from effects which are natural, miraculous, and created by artifice.

When one does not find that a power is miraculous or natural or a clever piece of artifice, \[it means\] that a pact has intervened. Theologians have usually explained this over-obscure, brief dictum in broader terms. It applies to demonic magic (i) if the things which are done exceed their natural capability. This happens if it is explicitly established that what has been done does not have sufficient power to achieve this effect and that there is no good reason to ascribe it to God or good angels. On this point, \[Gregorio de\] Valencia says that the object employed for that purpose will fail to work if the distance \[at which it is meant to operate\] is too great, because there is general agreement that the cause \[of an action\] which is at a distance \[from its object\] cannot work unless the space between them is altered. Consequently, if that same cause did not work after it had been brought nearer or very close to \[its object\], but does work at a distance, Valencia thinks it is clear \[the action\] is not being done naturally. He says it would be another matter if a person of sound judgement were at least to confess he did not know the cause, because the power and comparative relationship of things in Nature is quite often hidden from us. It would also be another matter, in my opinion, if sensible people were to disagree with each other about whether such a thing can be done naturally or not-for example, if they were discussing an effect produced in something which was not far enough away \[from its cause\]. It is doubtful, you see, whether anything can act directly upon a passive object which is at a distance from it and have no effect at all on the space which is between them, and whether an active and a passive object have to be next to each another at the same time in accordance with the \[kind of\] contact known as \'quantitative\': or whether it is enough for them to touch in a manner known as \'virtual\' because its passive object exists inside the space to which the power of the active object can extend; because although in St Thomas \[Aquinas\]\'s opinion, not many people \[think this\] and it is not particularly likely, he does say it rests upon very plausible arguments and very serious-minded men have found it acceptable.

\(ii\) These same theologians think that there are three other sins attached to demonic magic. (a) If unknown, spurious, cryptic words are employed, \[words which\] are ridiculous, completely incoherent, or sacred but twisted to mean other things or to a meaning they were not designed to have; or if names of God, whose meaning one does not recognise, are adopted, or unknown names of good or bad angels, \[names\] the Church does not recognise. (Guillaume d\'Auvergne has discussed these very learnedly.)⁵¹ It is the same thing if certain characters or other figures are used, apart from the sign of the cross, or if that sign is not placed or fashioned as it should be, or placed where it should not be, or repeated unnecessarily in certain places a certain number of times; and finally, if some other object which has nothing to do with the effect intended by the operation is added. (b) When the effectiveness of the operation is attributed to certain ritual actions and practices peculiar to and especially devised for it-for example, that \[the operation\] be done on certain days or at certain hours, when the stars are in a particular position, on condition that there is a certain number of crosses or candles, or that an object is positioned in a particular way in such and such a drawing, and this it be of such and such a colour or shape. (c) When power is attributed to other practices which are clearly superfluous and neither good nor bad-for example, when, in order to drive out an evil spirit, someone is shaved so that he can be clothed in a piece of cloth which has never been washed, when he carries out the operation with one foot naked, without wearing a belt, with his hair dishevelled, and things of this kind.
[Page 15]

When it is said that all these, or one of them, is necessary for the operation to be successful, one is quite rightly more than suspicious, especially when two things happen at the same time, namely, one believes that what is done is not proportionate to the effect which is meant to be produced and is not being done with legitimate authority-that is, when the person who arranged and prescribed an object as a sign for such an effect was unable to make good a defect in Nature. (God does this in the sacraments, and the Church in her sacramental). Likewise when the effect itself cannot be produced except by means of a cause provided by the intellect and the required conditions do not seem to be of a kind which is appropriate or one which usually moves God or the angels to produce the effect, because under those circumstances it is clearer than daylight that the hoped-for effect can come only from an evil spirit: for example, if anyone demands that a statue tell him about things which are secret, any threats or prayers he might make would be absurd and ridiculous, as were those of the magicians Porphyrius tells us about, and the seal-rings of Lachesis made, according to Claudius Claudianus, for these people, perhaps in imitation of those \[secret things\].

On the other hand, when wonderful effects of this kind follow on from anything, and as often as this is done without ceremonies or ritual observances, we quite rightly come to the conclusion that the effect is produced by Nature. Here we must be careful to be on our guard with respect to the last two points \[I have made\] so that on the one hand during this investigation we are not rash enough to come to the hasty conclusion that all the effects are natural, because on many occasions an evil spirit adds a number of natural things to the mixture to make us think the whole thing is natural, and on the other we do not condemn them rashly because, (as St Augustine tells us), the natural properties of many things surpass and are hidden from our knowledge.⁵³ Things done by artifice can be detected with very little trouble if a demonstration of how they are done is given privately either to a magistrate, (whose job it is to examine these things judicially in open court, or to testify publicly to those who admire such things that \[their performers\] are licensed to do them), or to a confessor in the court of the confessional.

Book 2, Question 6

Does this magic produce real effects, and how can one recognise the pact which underlies them?

Anyone who maintains that all effects are the result of a conjuring-trick, or believes that they are all real, must be a water-melon, not a human being. Quite often an evil spirit deceives us because he is the father of lying. Therefore, he frequently blunts the eyes or dupes the other senses by casting a deceptive image in front of them. \[But\] not infrequently God obstructs him so that he cannot actually do something he would want or be able to do as a mark of favour to magicians, and when he realises this, he takes refuge in conjuring-tricks in order to hide his impotence. But when the evil spirit wants to produce a genuine effect and God allows him to do so, provided the \[effect\] does not go beyond the power he has, God does nothing to stop him from producing a real effect. Indeed, natural causes do give rise to a real effect, so the Devil can use them and connect active things with passive and therefore will be able to produce effects which are genuine. The minor proposition is proved because, according to the admirable author, Dionysius of Athens, \[the Devil\] lost none of his natural gifts by sinning and consequently it turns out that he also possesses a natural power which is very strong, a multiplicity of daily experience, and an exact knowledge of essential character and capabilities which are peculiar to each and every thing-so much so that he can very easily and accurately produce the effect he wants. This is why the majority of theologians cleverly recognise two magical effects-those which are real and those which are apparent. (This is why Tertullian calls \[magicians\] mountebanks and tricksters). I myself add a third type, a mixture of true and false effects, or ones which are merely apparent.
[Page 16]

I am referring to the effects of conjuring-tricksters\' \[apparatus\] which I reviewed in Book 1, chapter 4. Likewise, there is the story Philostratus wrote about a young man, Menippus, and all the furnishings and drinking-vessels at his wedding to a vampire witch \[lamia\], a story I have mentioned elsewhere, and Nicephorus\'s story about Empusa or \[Gelō\]-that when he was a child she often took \[the Emperor\] Maurice out of his bed, with no trouble at all, as though she intended to eat him directly. Secondly, there is the story about Pasetes whose habit was to use certain incantations to make it look as though a sumptuous banquet suddenly appeared. Then, whenever he wanted, everything would vanish again. It was also his custom to buy things and pay the price, but not long afterwards it would be seen that the money had secretly returned from the seller to the buyer. Thirdly, we read many such things about Simon Magus \[the Magician\] in St Clement of Rome \[who says\] he created a new human being out of air, became invisible to anyone he wanted, pierced rocks as though they were mud, brought statues to life, did not burn when he was placed on a fire, gave people to understand that, like Janus, he had two faces, changed himself into a sheep or a nanny-goat, rose into the air and flew, suddenly displayed a great deal of gold, was able to make kings and depose them. He told a scythe to come and reap, and it came and reaped ten times as much as any of the other \[scythes\]. Once, when a prostitute, Selene, was in a castle-tower and a huge crowd had hurried to see her and the tower was surrounded by a garland of bystanders, he made it look as though she was looking at the entire populace and leaning out of every window in the tower simultaneously. Finally, by means of earnest conjurations, he would evoke the soul of a child who had suffered a violent death, and with its help would do things of this kind. This is what Clement says.

Anastasius Nicenus adds several pieces of information. \'He used to make statues walk\', he says, \'and when he rolled himself round in a fire he would not be burned. He used to fly in the air and make bread from stones. He would turn into a snake and transform himself into many other creatures. He used to have two faces, change himself into gold, and cause all kinds of things to appear during banquets. He used to make the vessels in houses appear to move unseen, of their own accord, to perform the functions of those who were carrying them, and he would cause many ghosts to walk in front of him, which he said were the souls of dead people\'. The historian \[Michael\] Glykas\'s selection of these are along the same lines. Fourthly, Nicetas Choniates refers to this \[in his story\] about a magician by whose agency an oarsman started to break all the pottery he was carrying.

Fifthly, within living memory, there took place the conjuring tricks of Ziton in Bohemia, with whom I shall also deal in the final chapter of the next Book. \'As a display of his skill he would present himself to the King now in his own appearance and stature, now in those of someone else: likewise, wearing crimson and silk which were then suddenly wool and dirty rags. He would also steer towards someone walking on dry land as though he himself were on water. On several occasions he would have himself conveyed by cockerels tied to the epiredium⁵⁷ as his carriage-horses. As well as this, he used to play games on the King\'s dinnerguests in various ways, sometimes transforming their hands into cows\' \'feet so that they could not reach their plates, and sometimes into horses\' hooves. Several times he fastened very wide antlers on their forehead, and whenever they looked out of the windows at an unexpected sight, obviously they could not draw their head and face back to the table again; and to demonstrate that he could easily procure money for his own use, he fashioned thirty fat pigs from bundles of hay and drove them off as food for a rich miller who lived very close by. He offered them for sale at a price the miller was willing to pay but warned the buyer not to drive his new flock to the river. The miller ignored this warning, the pigs sank, and the miller saw bundles \[of hay\] floating in the river. So he looked for the seller for a long time and finally discovered him in a wine-shop, lying down on a bench with his feet stretched out. Filled with anger, he tried to seize hold of him by one of his feet and wake him up. Ziton shrieked loudly, got hold of the buyer by the throat, and dragged him off to ajudge. What was the miller to do, (since, so he thought, he had clearly been arrested), unless he were to add insult to injury with \[another\] injury and compound this injustice with Ziton further?\' Thus far Dubravius. Lastly, \[one should mention\] magicians\' boastful claims for certain herbs such as vervain, latace, sage, and carline thistle-for which see Pliny and Gellius.
[Page 17]

Finally, there are the kinds of things which (shame on them!) certain overcredulous, but in other respects devout princes used to allow to be done in their presence. \[A magician\] would place iron objects, without a magnet, silver dishes, and similar things of great weight on top of a table and draw them, jumping up and down as they went, from one end of the table to the other without the help of a cord, a hair, or any other device. He would get someone to pull out a playing-card from the rest of the pack without letting anyone else see it, and then change its face three times while the person who drew it still had the card in his hand. \[The magician\] would fashion mirrors which seemed to show things happening in places far away. He would make a real shrub grow in the space of three hours, a span\'s length from the table, and trees with leaves and fruit to spring up from another one he put in its place on the same spot. He would light a lantern with a special flame and make all the women present take off their clothes and reveal to the eyes those parts which Nature tells us should remain concealed; and while they were unclothed like this, they could not stop stamping their feet and jumping and dancing \[tripudiare\] as long as the lantern, which was hung up in the middle of the room, inscribed with certain characters, and filled with hare\'s fat, continued to burn. \[There are\] other stories of the same kind which apprentice entertainers gulp down when they read and learn from the writings of Battista della Porta, and since these do not offer either natural causes or satisfactory explanations involving skilful ingenuity to account for such things, one must ascribe them to conjuring-tricks.

According to most people, examples of genuine effects are (i) snake-charming, about which the prophet \[David\] says, \'Their frenzy is like that of a snake such as a deaf adder which refuses to listen and will not hear the voice of the enchanters and of the worker of poisonous magic while he is uttering his clever chants\', \[Psalm 58.4\]. (ii) Likewise the signs and wonders of the false prophets in St Matthew\'s Gospel, and (iii) those which, as I shall point out in their proper places, can be done and have been done. There are two \[examples\] in Holy Scripture about which it is not at all clear whether their effects were genuine or simply appeared to be so. The first is the resuscitation of Samuel by a female diviner \[pythonissa\].

Those who think it was not Samuel\'s soul which came, but an evil spirit under enchantment \[daemonem larvatum\] which came in his place, class this as an illusion, and perfectly serious writers have been of this opinion, too. In his book, Care for the Dead, however, St Augustine firmly maintains-as do \[Alonso\] Tostado and \[Nicholas\] of Lyra, and a good many modern \[writers\] I have praised elsewhere-that it really was Samuel\'s soul which appeared to Saul, not one evoked by the power of a magical chant. (Tertullian and those who followed him quite rightly rebut this.) But by God\'s command it came quickly in order to rebuke the irreligious king and call him to repentance for fear of his death which had been intimated to him. This opinion seems to me to be more true and more reliable because objectors do not yet offer a sufficiently satisfactory answer to the very clear testimony of Ecclesiasticus \[46.20\] where we read the following about Samuel. \'And after this he fell asleep\', (that is, he died and rested), \'and the King was told\', (which king, if not Saul, and when, if not on this occasion?), \'and Samuel showed him the end of his life\', (he foretold that Saul would die the next day), \'and he raised his voice from the earth in prophecy\'.
[Page 18]

What is this if not a coming forth from Hell which is in the middle of the earth? What is this if not someone speaking in his own voice and prophesying? Assuredly none other than he who had died and fallen asleep. The objection that he says, \'Tomorrow you will be with me\', Kings 28.19\] does not preclude this, because it cannot be said of Samuel\'s real soul. That was in Limbo, whereas Saul\'s was in Hell. How can a lie be attributed to the prophet? I am not saying this precludes \[the objection\] because those words, (as St Augustine says), can either be said of a state like that of death, as though he were saying, \"Tomorrow you will be with me, not as one of the living but as one of the dead. Tomorrow will be the last day which will dawn for you\': or we can say, in reference to the close resemblance of this place and habitation, that \[both Samuel and Saul\] are like someone who is in the same city, although not in the same house. The Limbo of the \[Church\] Fathers and the place \[called\] Gehenna belonging to the same Hell are different dwelling-places, like houses in a single town. (I shall say more on this subject later in this same Book in question 26, section 4.)

The second \[example\], about the magicians in Egypt who vied with Moses in the performance of miracles, is open to uncertainty. It is written \[Exodus 7.11-12\] as follows: \'By means of incantations in Egyptian and certain secrets \[they had\], they did likewise and each man threw down his magic wand which turned into a snake\'. In many other places, too, they are later said \'to have done the same kind of thing as Moses\' and to have tried, in what turned out to be a fruitless attempt, to produce stinging insects, \[Exodus 8.8\]; and \'they could not do it\' is added. It is possible to defend the opinion of those who think that the magicians\' snakes and frogs were simply conjuring-tricks. Nevertheless, everyone else\'s opinion has always seemed to me to be more reliable and more likely because it is more consistent with Scripture and is not inconsistent with the known facts of natural philosophy. Doesn\'t it say that the magicians did just as Moses did? But he produced real snakes and real frogs. If those of the magicians were merely apparent, why didn\'t Moses reveal their fraud, or why did God allow him to be deceived in such a serious matter? Why are the magicians said to have tried \[to produce\] stinging insects and could not do so, if they did not actually try to produce real stinging insects?

There is still argument about the way in which they were produced. The more worthwhile argument comes from those who think the Devil stealthily withdrew the wands while the spectators were not paying attention, and substituted genuine snakes the same size as the wands in their place so quickly and so cleverly that the Egyptians who were watching were completely convinced that the appearance of the wands themselves had been changed this way: and because of this error of judgement by the spectators, when Scripture said the wands were changed into snakes, \[the change took place\] not in reality but in people\'s opinion. Consequently, they argue that \[both interpretations\] have something in common because, just as Moses\'s snake was real, the magicians\' snakes were real as well. However, just as snakes were produced from Moses\'s rod\'s acting as the final point of a change which had \[already\] started, snakes were produced from the magicians\' wands, too, but \[their wands were not the final point at which the change ceased to take place. I know why they say this and what their reasons are, but in my opinion there is nothing contrary to the principles of natural philosophy if we say, along with St Augustine and \[Cardinal\] Cajetan that real snakes and frogs came out of real wands which were acting as the source of change. Insects are living creatures and belong to a class of things which are not yet complete. The Devil could have produced them in a short space of time from wands which had become rotten, (something not beyond his capability), because what the sun would take many days to effect, he can do in a very short space of time by applying active \[agents\] which he knows are rather effective for this purpose.
[Page 19]

So, is there no difference between the magicians\' marvels and those of Moses? First, what Moses did was miraculous. What the magicians did was merely amazing. Secondly, Listen to \[Michael\] Glykas. \'They themselves did indeed turn their wands into snakes, but Moses\'s rod began to swallow their wands. They also turned water into blood but, once it had been changed, they could not turn it back into its former state. They also produced frogs but were unable to cleanse the Egyptians\' houses of them again. These \[creatures\] had the ability to cause annoyance to the Egyptians, but \[the magicians\] had no power to check the punishment which was being meted out to \[the Egyptians\]. Indeed, God even afflicted their bodies with pustules to a greater extent than He did to those of anyone else so that it would become clear from this not only that \[the magicians\] could not prevent the punishments they had provoked from God, but also that they \[would have to\] endure the same punishments as everyone else\'.

My opinion is that the example relating to Samuel\'s soul belongs entirely to the class of \[stories\] which are a mixture \[of truth and falsehood\] because, while the soul of Samuel which appeared was real, one detects falsehood or deception of the senses (a) in the fact that it seemed to obey the diviner\'s voice, and (b) in the fact that it did not seem to have brought \[Samuel\'s\] real body or his real shroud with it. The second example, relating to the Egyptian magicians, will also belong to the class of \'compounds\' if we follow the opinion of those who do not know that the snakes \[appeared as the result of\] a rapid substitution. On the other hand, if we agree with St Augustine\'s opinion, it will belong to the class of things which are \[entirely\] true. Let me also, with pleasure, number among \[examples\] of the \'compound\' type an extraordinary story by Robert Triezius from Lille about a contest between two magicians. One of them had seized an extraordinarily beautiful girl, set her on a wooden horse, and carried her off through the air. The other was presiding over a well-attended banquet in a castle in Burgundy and because the abductor was flying over this castle, he used spells \[carminibus\] to force the abductor to come down into the castle yard. He kept the crestfallen man there, unable to move, in front of everyone, along with his blushing prey. The abductor, however, was not slow to chant a spell secretly against the man who had got the better of him this way and who was not afraid of \[suffering\] anything similar. This man had thrust his head and neck through the bars of a window very high up \[in the wall\] while he was looking down \[into the yard\], and the abductor disrespected him by making huge horns suddenly sprout from his forehead, thus trapping and suspending him from the iron bars by the size of his branch-like extensions. As a result, he could not withdraw his head through the grating and, terrified by the dizzying height, he did not dare lower himself to the ground. The two men mutually agreed upon each other\'s safety, and then the one wearing the horns set the abductor free and sent him on his way with his prize. The abductor rose into the air once again, hidden in the fold of a cloud, and the other man got rid of his horns and, to the great delight of the spectators, withdrew his head safely into the dining-room. I believe the flying happened, but that the evil spirit\'s lifting the wooden\] foal \[into the air\] is not something peculiar to him, \[because lifting things into the air\] is something birds do. So, it is possible that the abductor and the girl he abducted were real, but I think the whole business of the horns was a conjuring-trick.
[Page 20]

So, now it remains to discuss how to distinguish genuine effects from counterfeit by looking at the pact involved. Marvels are not accomplished by magicians, but by the evil spirit himself, and therefore magicians will not be able, (as some people have written without due caution), to accomplish what an evil spirit cannot. But because of their pact, whatever he can do, magicians will be able to do as well. Once this basic point has been made, the following rules, like the pillars of the building, can be built on top of it. (i) If the magical effect is of the kind which exceeds the power exercised by an evil spirit-and powers of this kind are reserved to the omnipotence of God alone-then the effect must be considered a conjuring-trick. (ii) If it is agreed that the effect is not beyond the power of an evil spirit, the matter is plainly open to doubt and one must then take a closer look at the circumstances. The reason for doubt is that God does not always allow an evil spirit to do whatever he is capable of doing and will stop him from doing it; and an evil spirit does not always actually want to do what he is permitted to do but does take pleasure, as a conjuror, in deceiving human beings. But whether the effect exceeds the power of the evil spirit will be investigated in greater detail in what I am going to say next.

Book 2, Question 7

Can magicians do anything which is genuinely miraculous?

From what I said at the end of the preceding question, it is clear that the same question remains-can a magician do anything, and can an evil spirit do anything?-since the things a magician does are done by an evil spirit by virtue of their pact. This is why, once upon a time, magicians claimed they could perform miracles. According to Clement of Rome, Simon the Samaritan boasted he could do anything he wanted to do and that everything was obedient to him. In the chapter on the types of evil spirits in his book on sacrifices, Porphyrius writes That no matter how many times evil spirits have recourse to stratagems \[to produce\] their marvels, many of the things they do are quite contrary to the usual order of Nature. Consequently, Iamblichus calls them \'lackeys of the gods\' because they seem to follow the gods\' footsteps very closely when they do extraordinary things. The poets thought the same, \[although\] perhaps it will be more convenient to quote their words in their appropriate places. Some more recent \[authors\] appear to fall into this error when they say one should not pay attention to Nature\'s laws when it comes to the workings of magic. This I shall now look at more carefully.

I should like the reader to observe that in this treatise I do not use the word \'miracle\' to mean any kind of extraordinary effect, which is what secular authors do. I follow theologians who give it a more restricted definition, which is that of the Greek Tò Oépas, \'simply an effect produced beyond and above the power belonging to the natural order of created things\', (for example, restoring sight to someone born blind, or resurrecting the dead). But when the effect is consistent with the power belonging to the natural order of created things, (for example, the ability to stir up rain and winds, cure a fever, etc.), the Greek word is usually Tò θαûpa-not simply \'a miracle\', but \'a miracle in accordance with x\', or, \'as far as we are concerned, or \'a wonder\', or \'something extraordinary.⁶⁵ Again, these wonders \[mira\] are divided into (a) \'wonders done without any kind of restriction\' \[absolute\], which refers to something which would be worthy of astonishment of itself and in its own right, even if we knew why it was wonderful and how it was done, and (b) \'wonders in accordance with x\', or \'wonders as far as we are concerned, which refer to things which astonish us because we do not know why they are extraordinary, but will cease to find them so once we find out what has caused them.
[Page 21]

It occurs to me that there are various signs by which a wonder can be distinguished from a miracle. (i) If, as I said, the effect surpasses the power and natural capacity of a created thing, it will be a miracle. (ii) If the proposed aim of the effect is not good, (for example, spiritual or physical welfare), but simply bad, (for example, curiosity or something else which is repugnant to good morals or the true Faith), it is not a miracle. Under this heading, it is proved that the prodigies and \'miracles\' of Antichrist will not be true miracles, which is what St Paul wrote to the Thessalonians \[2 Thessalonians 2.9-10\]. From this it is clear what one must think about the cure of swollen glands done by that heretic prince Elizabeth, Queen of the English, if, as that parasite Tooker claims, she does it in confirmation of her faith. (iii) The wonders of evil spirits are often deficient in the smallest details, whereas miracles are perfect because they are works of God. (See Exodus 8 on the contest between the magicians and Moses.) (iv) The wonders of evil spirits vanish in the face of genuine miracles, just as the magicians\' wands were devoured by Moses\'s rod, and the oracles of evil spirits fell dumb in the presence of saintly people. (v) Finally, miracles happen as the result of open, earnest invocation of God. Magicians\' wonders always take place with a mixture of discordant, secret, meaningless, ridiculous, or superstitious prayers or signs.

First conclusion: No magicians can produce miracles in the proper sense of the word. It is the common opinion of theologians, (one which is proven), first that infinite power is required for working a miracle, and therefore \[such working\] is reserved to God, while the entire power of a created being is limited by bounds set by Nature. If it were otherwise, we should not have an effective argument to prove the truth of the Faith which the Church has always buttressed with miracles, in imitation of our Saviour who used this argument to prove that the unbelief of the Jews could not be excused because of the obvious miracles which had been performed in front of them. \'Had I not done things which no one else has done, they would not have had sin\', \[John 15.24\]. If you object that miracles have sometimes been performed by wicked people and people with a false notion of the Faith, and therefore miracles should not be considered an effective way of proving the Faith, I shall counter \[by saying\] that God is accustomed sometimes to extend this grace gratuitously even to people of that sort, but \[does so\] in proof of the true Faith, as when He gave a prophecy to Balaam and Caiaphas. He has never given confirmation of a false faith and cannot do so. God is no more capable of using miracles to confirm a lie than truth itself is capable of lying. Therefore, the genuine miracles of pseudo-prophets are done in Christ\'s name and provide confirmation of the true Faith. From this it is clear one must be careful to make a distinction, as in the following inference. \'X has performed a miracle, therefore his faith is true\', and \'X performed a genuine miracle to confirm the faith he was professing, therefore this faith of his is true\'. The first can be false because God is capable of working a miracle through infidels. The second is always true because God cannot work miracles through anyone to confirm a false faith. What Nicodemus said about Christ\'s miracles confirms my conclusion: \'No one can perform these wonders unless God is with him\', \[John 3.2\]. This is also the opinion of Origen, Against Celsus Book 2, St Augustine, The Trinity Book 3, chapter 8, and St Isidore, \[Differences\], the chapter \'not wonderful\', 26, question 2. Francisco Toledo says more about this in his learned comments on John, but when he says there that evil spirits sometimes do things which not only look like, but actually are miracles, he needs to be read with caution because he has stretched the word \'miracle\' to \[include\] any kind of marvel and spurious miracle, and this runs counter to the common meaning of the word \[as used\] by theologians.
[Page 22]

Second conclusion: Magicians cannot perform wonders without any kind of restriction, either. This is obvious because nothing actually done without any kind of restriction and which is wonderful in itself must be the same as a miracle, and this is what the prophet \[David\] means when he says, \'Blessed is the Lord God of Israel who alone does wonderful things\', and \'who alone performs great wonders.⁶⁷ Ignorant people usually think that certain things which have not risen from natural causes are wonderful in this unrestricted sense, an example being what the Kouropalates \[major-domo\] tells us about the dead Michael Cerulius\'s right hand which had taken the shape of a cross and stayed firmly in place like that. But in Volume XI of his Annals, for the year 1058, \[Cesare\] Baronio reveals a deception. While the parts of a dead person\'s body are still warm, someone who wants them to assume a \[particular\] shape and position \[finds\] that when they turn stiff and cold, they stay in that position and cannot be moved, and \[Baronio\] adds shrewdly that such things done by human craft are the \'miracles\' of schismatics, (I add \'of heretics as well\').

Third conclusion: With the assistance of an evil spirit, and if God allows it, magicians can produce many marvels \'in accordance with x\' or \'as far as we are concerned. One must look for the proof of this conclusion in the fact that there are very many wonderful and hidden effects in Nature, and the Devil knows all of them very well. He also knows all those which can be produced very quickly, although not instantaneously. Consequently, (as St Augustine said somewhere), it is very difficult for a human being to understand how far the Devil\'s power extends, and a saying of the prophet \[Job\] speaks about this, \'There is no power on earth which can compare with him who has been made so that he is not afraid of anyone\', \[Job 41.24\]. I do not want to accumulate a large number \[of examples\], so let one, told by Antonio de Torquemada, (which is full of surprise), do duty for all of them. In certain places in the Kingdom of Naples, when women give birth, just before the child is born, a single little frog or venomous toad, (or more than one), comes out first. If one of them touches the ground and immediately begins to jump about all over the place, the woman in labour dies at once. Consequently, the custom is to put straw mats all over the ground and cover the walls completely with tapestries so that while these ill-omened forerunners are falling or jumping out of the womb, they cannot reach the ground. This is why midwives usually have basins in the house, or another kind of vessel filled with water into which they can throw these little creatures. Then they cover it up thoroughly, take it down to a river, and drown \[the creatures\] in it. This is what Torquemada says, and a reliable tradition reports it as established fact. 69 If this does happen, I think it happens because of the cunning device of an evil spirit who counterfeits these frogs in answer to the requests of some worker of harmful magic \[malefici\] and kills the woman in labour, although God allows this to happen for good reasons. It is clear from this that without His permission, the evil spirit can do nothing, because not only could he not have harmed Job-something he very much wanted to do-on the strength of his own authority, but he could not have deceived the treacherous king, his slave, \[3 Kings 22.22 or indeed have gone into the pigs \[Matthew 8.31-32\]. Hence it happened that even though the Emperor Nero lacked neither intelligence, nor wealth, nor will, nor desire, nor tutors, the Devil would never be able to undertake a single trial of magic through him, and in consequence Nero would despise magic, \[Pliny, Inquiry into Nature 30.1415\]. Evidently the provident goodness of God did not allow this instrument, which was very ready to do harm, to come near the highest \[kind of\] power and the most corrupt \[kind of\] malice. (The extraordinary works of Antichrist will belong to this type of marvel.)
[Page 23]

Book 2, Question 8

How do magicians work these wonders with the help of the Devil?

You need to understand that all evil spirits operate either by unmediated action through local motion, or by mediated action, and this is done in two ways, either by deceiving the senses, or by applying active things to passive and so causing a genuine alteration. This is a teaching common to all theologians. Therefore, evil spirits operate through local motion and the alteration of things, or through deception.

With respect to local motion: inferior bodies obey the angels to such an extent that they can rotate the heavens. (I shall have to discuss elsewhere \[the question of\] whether such movers of the spheres exist in fact). Given that they can move them, however, it follows that there is no object so huge that evil spirits cannot move it from its place with a hefty shove-provided, of course, they do not thereby disturb the order of the universe, which means they will not have the power to move an entire element from its place-and it is with this agreed limitation in mind that one should understand that what Firmilianus wrote to St Cyprian about the earth, would not be true of local or partial motion. Nor will \[evil spirits\] be able to change the way the heavens move in their ordained orbit. But an evil spirit can move bodies very quickly by means of local motion and it is because of this motion that we see that the heavens are being set in motion very rapidly. So this is how \[a spirit\] can move something from one\'s sight and substitute something else so instantaneously that he deceives the minds and eyes of onlookers, and persuades them that the first thing has changed completely into the second.

Such, as St Augustine observed, were the kind of transformations pagans thought they should believe in-that of Diomedes\'s companions into birds, \[and\] that of Iphigenia into a deer. Astyrius disclosed a fraud, the perpetration of which Eusebius rescued from oblivion. \'At Caesarea Philippi, which the Phoenicians calls \"Paneas\", a sacrificial victim is brought to springs which burst out there from the lower slopes of Mount Paneion. (These springs are said to be the source of the \[River\] Jordan.) On one of the pagans\' feast-days \[the victim\] was slaughtered, thrown \[into the water\] and, through the force and power of an evil spirit, vanished from people\'s sight in an extraordinary way. Those who were present thought this a most remarkable miracle. Astyrius happened to be there on one occasion while this was taking place, and when he saw so many people astounded by it, he was very distressed by their mistaken belief. So, he looked up at the sky and humbly entreated God, the ruler of everything, through Christ to restrain the evil spirit who had shat⁷¹ on the people by leading them so badly astray, and to control him because of the fraud and deceits he is in the habit of practising against human beings. When he had prayed to God this way, the sacrificial victim suddenly floated on top of the springs, and so the \[spectacle\] it had been their custom to find so astonishing was completely ruined, so much so that in future no miracle would ever take place there again\'.

The second method applies active things to passive. By altering or changing things this way, an evil spirit often creates wonders whose causes are natural but unknown to us, although very well known to him because he sees the essences of every thing and is acquainted with the particular properties of each one of them. He knows the right times to apply \[the active things\], and there is scarcely any clever device or contrivance he does not know. After all, what has he not achieved by assiduous daily experience and observation? In particular, he knows everything good angels have managed to do since the beginning of the world, what human beings have thought, and very many things good angels have learned from God and which they reveal to Satan at God\'s command. Therefore, very often many things are done instantaneously, which Nature could never have done by herself alone unless evil spirits had assisted her by means of this ingenious application of theirs. Under those circumstances, they are using natural agents as their instruments. The nature of an instrument, however, is to produce an outcome, not simply one which is equal to the power of the instrument, but one which is more excellent by far, and corresponds to the active property of the person in charge of the instrument and sets it to work. An axe has, of itself, merely the ability to cut, but in as far as it is the instrument of a skilled carpenter, it has the ability to make a table or a statue. The innate heat of human semen, in as far as it is heat, has the ability to warm, to rarefy, to separate, and to condense; but in as far as it is an instrument of the soul, it has the ability to produce bones, nerves, and flesh. I shall use similar reasoning to look at the natural causes used by evil spirits to produce much better outcomes from the power belonging to those natural causes, because those causes could never have produced those outcomes the way they usually work had not an evil spirit applied them \[to this end\]; and under these circumstances, as instruments set in motion by evil spirits, they produce marvels in respect of \[a change in\] their substance, the way \[the change is made\], or the speed \[with which it is done\]. These operations, however, never escape the limitations \[put on them\] by Nature, because they do not exceed the natural power of their principal cause; and since these effects actually exist in the natural agents which have been applied in this fashion, the devil confers nothing on those agents when he applies them, apart from the \[particular\] circumstance without which the outcome would not be effected. This is because although the evil spirit uses the natural power of the things he has applied, he operates principally by means of artifice, just as when a cook prepares nice food and cooks it, using fire as the medium of his craft, even though fire works naturally, it would never have achieved the \[desired\] outcome had it not been applied for the purpose of the craft \[of cooking\]. But what does the cook confer upon the fire other than method and circumstance, without which \[the outcome\] would not take place? He exercises over the fire no power which deserves to be called a physical cause.
[Page 24]

One should note two things at this point: (i) that one must not consider only the activity of the natural object, according to what it wants to do, or only the evil spirit\'s application \[of that activity\] according to what it can do, but natural power as applied by the evil spirit; (ii) that the thing which has been applied is the instrumental cause in these operations, while the principal cause is the evil spirit himself who is applying it. Consequently, so that it can be said that an outcome cannot be produced naturally, it must be such that it surpasses the capability of both these causes together.

So much for \[what I have to say\] about effecting change. Now \[let me turn\] to the delusion \[of the senses\]. When neither local motion nor application of the type I have been discussing is sufficiently effective, magicians usually take refuge in travelling showmen\'s tricks and so play upon people\'s senses with their lying pretence that even the smallest thing magicians do may be considered done by deception. (I am expanding the word \'deception\' to include conjuring-trickery, deception, and error, even though these are normally kept distinct). The Devil has three ways in particular of deceiving people-by changing an object, by changing the medium \[via which the change is done\], or by changing the sense-organ itself, and because the Jesuit \[Luis\] Molina has explained this better than anyone else, let me follow what he says.

He tells us that as far as the object is concerned this \[change\] is possible (i) by rapid movement of the objects which have been shown \[to onlookers\], suddenly hiding them, putting them in a different place, or secretly separating them or joining them together, which is what mountebank conjurors do with various strips of cloth, little balls, small cups, and so forth; (ii) by a skilful use of optics, placing the object in a particular position in the path of the onlooker\'s eye-for example, when lines are drawn in an irregular order, it turns out that when someone sees them from a position directly opposite by looking through a small aperture or by means of a whirling board, they present him with the sight of a cleverly painted picture. Very important scholars think that if one shines lamp-light, burning with \[a mixture of\] wax and snake-skin which has been impregnated with sulphur, on rushes and straws strewn on the floor, it makes them appear to be dancing snakes. (I prefer to classify this example as a mixture of natural and instrumental magic). (iii) When they suddenly fashion an object out of the elements, especially air, and present it to the spectators-for example, when they themselves pick up \[such an object\], or put an object made from air round something else, or make an object which looks like something one has imagined; (iv) when they put \[next to something\] a compound object, such as a mineral, which, because of its natural power is responsible for making the object placed next to it appear to be something quite different. In this case one is usually not sure whether the natural power belonging to the object which has been placed next to \[the first one\] is what is doing this, whether an evil spirit is imprinting that condition on the object, or whether he is simply producing that condition in the medium itself, and because this condition is acting as a medium, the appearances delivered via the medium are modified in such a way as to explain why the object appears to be something else. This is why a piece of light blue cloth seen through the green lens of a dioptra appears to be green.

In the case of the medium\'s being air, they do the following: (i) they stop the outward shapes of things from being brought to the eye or one of the other senses-for example, when they hide from sight the entire object which is in front of people, or simply a part of it; (ii) they imbue the medium with a condition in which, while they are going through that medium the appearances of things are modified in such a way that the object looks different from what it actually is-for example, if salt is mixed with vinegar and a scrap of linen cloth soaks up this vinegar and, not long afterwards, the rag is lit by a candle\'s being placed underneath it, the visual shapes which will be diffused via the medium \[of the rag\] which has been lit up by this flame will make the faces of those who are present look terrible. Likewise, if one were to make a candle out of ass\'s semen and wax, and this candle was the only light during a dinner-party, all the diners, (if one can possibly believe the Bishop of Paris), would look as though they had donkeys\' heads.⁷⁵ (iii) If the medium round the object is made thicker, the object\'s appearance is altered, as when a coin thrown into a bowl filled with water looks bigger when it lies at the bottom and is viewed from the surface. The same thing can be said if the vapours of the air in between are condensed, which is why the moon seems to grow smaller and undergo change in various ways, so that we think a cockerel is dragging a wooden beam along when in fact it is dragging a straw. (iv) If there is movement in the air which is the medium, visual images are set in motion at the same time, and this is why people travelling by ship think that trees are moving in tandem with the motion of the vessel. (The Devil made this happen so that the ship which was bringing Mother Idaea would look as though it was following Claudia\'s belt).⁷⁶
[Page 25]

Sometimes it turns out that the organ \[of sight\] is deceived by a different arrangement or a multiplication of sensory images. This sometimes happens because of the shape of the instrument through which we see them-for example, when a single vantage point shows us more than one form of a single object. Sometimes, because of the way the instruments are arranged and placed, (for example, if we put a large number of mirrors in different places), it will be possible for so many images to multiply themselves \[by appearing to be\] in several places at once that those which are in one place do seem to be in another, and we automatically think that we are seeing the object which is actually in front of us. Sometimes it can happen through the mere transition of the sensory images which exist in the imagination to the external sense, or at least to the common sense, and these senses are affected by the images the same way they would be if the images were sent there from external objects. Certain people refer to an apparition, described by St Augustine, which appeared to a philosopher who was trying to resolve some problems.⁷⁷

Deception with respect to the organ \[of sight\] is no less varied. (i) It happens when the placement of the organ is changed, and this causes an object which is in one place to appear to be in another, or to appear as two when there is only one. For example, if you stick your finger between the eye \[and\] the space in which the eye is enclosed and push upwards or downwards on the eye with your knuckle, you will cause a single object to appear to be two. (ii) If the humours are agitated or disturbed, one sees things other than they are, which is what happens in the case of drunks or people who are completely out of control. They believe \'they see a double sun and two of Thebes.⁷⁸ In this category one must include the illusions of a Jew, Zedekiah, who lived at the time of Louis the Devout \[778-840\]. He would throw a man into the air, tear him to pieces, collect the pieces together, and reunite them again, and he would also swallow a cart laden with hay, together with its horses and driver, in the presence of the entire population. (Several of these \[tricks\] are a mixture of the first and second kind \[of delusion I have just mentioned\]). A third type usually involves interfering with sensory perception-obstructing the pathway of the \[vital\] spirits \[spiritus\] with some rather thick humour so that they cannot reach the senseorgan or blunting the ability to perceive sensorily in some other way. (This is, perhaps, how the angels struck the people of Sodom with blindness), \[Genesis 19.11\]. However, when an evil spirit convinces human beings they have been changed into animals, he does not merely change the organ but sometimes the medium as well, and he always changes the imagination at the same time, as in the case of Praestantius\'s father, described by St Augustine.79 The Devil, you see, can put together and arrange semblances of things in such a way that even while someone is awake, (which is what St Augustine says), he will dream as people who are asleep do, and think he is feeling things he does not feel, the way mad people do. This is how a Turkish incantation to get back runaways works. (It is described by Bartholomej Georgijević in his book on Turkish customs, folio 93.

Furthermore, one can detect the effects produced by conjuring-tricks by means of two rules. The first is that if the effect does not arise from local motion and goes beyond what natural causes can do when they are brought into play-resuscitating a dead person, for example, or curing genuine blindness--- deception and a conjuring-trick has taken place. The second \[rule\] is that when something one has seen vanishes in an instant and is no longer visible, this is a conjuring-trick. An example of the first is when magicians put a bow made from a particular wood in a room and shoot an arrow made from a different wood from a string of a particular thickness. When they do this, they make it seem as though a river as wide as the flight of the arrow has sprung up in that place. \[An example\] of the second is when magicians seem to carve up and eat a horse which, not long afterwards, is produced sound and whole. Likewise in the incident reported by Nicetas about a counterfeit snake.
[Page 26]

\'When, from a rather high place in the palace at Constantinople, Michael Sicydites saw a skiff which was carrying pots and dishes, he \[uttered\] a magical incantation and made a sailor get up and carry on breaking the pottery until he had reduced it to dust. But not long afterwards he seized hold of his beard and began to weep and, once his mental blindness had cleared, he started to wail that he had been driven \[to do it\] as though by the wrath of a divinity. Asked why he had treated his merchandise this way, he told a painful story. He was concentrating on his rowing, \[he said\], when he saw a dreadful snake stretched out on top of the pots. With unblinking eyes, it turned towards him as though it was going to devour him and did not stop coiling itself up until the earthenware had been shattered. Then suddenly it vanished from his eyes\'. William of Newburgh testifies to the conjuring-tricks of Eon, a heretic and a magician. \'He used to bewitch \[fascinasse\] people\'s eyes so that they thought there was a great crowd of men in front of them, and an abundance of delicious food fit for a king, and the most magnificent furniture\'. At length, however, he was sentenced at the Council of Rheims, and while he was being led to his death he quite frequently said to the earth, \'Earth, open up!\' a fruitless attempt we read about in Robert\'s Chronicle.

This is how the evil spirit amuses himself with conjuring-tricks and, not content with imitating miracles by means of conjuring-tricks, tries to represent those very conjuring-tricks to heretics \[as miracles\] by means of crafty deceits as well. I have read an example \[of this\] which was so delightful and amusing that, because it diverted me, I cannot deprive the readers of this book of it and so, for the sake of giving them respectable pleasure, I am now happy to undertake the trouble of transcribing it for them.

\'At the time of Sigismund I, King of Poland, Jakob Melstinki, governor of the town of Brzeziny \[Brezin\], in a particularly frivolous frame of mind, appropriated to himself the authority and name of Christ and, as the Twelve, chose the two Zatorskis from Krakow, while the remaining \[ten\] were thieves like himself. He gave each of these the name of one of the Apostles and called himself Jesus Christ. While they were walking through villages all over the place, they used to work wonders after the fashion of jesters and conjurors. They would secretly suborn other cheats and thieves to play dead, and then resurrect them; they would first put fish in muddy bogs where fish could never be born, and then in the name of Christ catch them with their hands; they would put loaves in ovens when there weren\'t any there beforehand, and then draw them out in the name of their \'Christ\', to the astonishment of the simple-minded common people.

On one occasion, \[Melstinki\] came with his apostles to the monastery of Czestochowa, famous for its icon of the Blessed Virgin. They stayed there for several days and secretly persuaded one of their number to act as though he were under the influence of an evil spirit, and by these means used to obtain food. He, you see, would walk through the guest-houses and snaffle pieces of meat from the kitchen, and throw them to his companions who would make the sign of the cross over them and eat them. When a large crowd of people had gathered in front of icon of the Blessed Virgin, \[Melstinki\'s\] tricksters brought their possessed companion to the altar, wearing two shirts so that he could put the things he needed into the space between. They actually put pebbles inside his undershirt and while they were bringing him to the altar, he broke free in a raging fury from the hands of those who were leading him, rushed up to the altar which was laden with offerings, snatched up some coins, and hid them in the space between his two shirts. At this interruption to the divine office, one monk fled from the altar. The other monks hurried to loosen \[the possessed man\'s\] belt. At that point, only the pebbles fell to the floor, while the money remained in his double shirt. The monks thought the money had been changed into pebbles by an artifice of the evil spirit and they tried, by means of exorcisms, to turn \[the money\] back into its former shape. 82 When the pebbles remained as they were, however, a monk full of indignation threw his holy book on the floor, saying, \"We have never had an evil spirit like this one. Away with him to all the devils!\"
[Page 27]

These tricksters fled to Silesia with the genuine money, and there they turned aside in a certain village to the house of a noble married woman. But because her husband was not there, she was unwilling to give them admittance and they merely asked for a napkin or a piece of cloth so that they could celebrate Mass. The woman offered them a little bundle of cloth and then they said, \'We shall take this with us, and Christ will bless you so that your flax grows more abundantly. Tell us if you have another one\'. Since they wanted to take this as well, the woman refused because she was afraid of her husband, but they secretly rolled up a scrap of kindling along with fire into the cloth and gave it back to the woman. Consequently, a chest was set on fire because of the cloth and the house was set alight because of the chest, and when the husband came back his wife said this had happened because she had treated Christ and His Apostles badly.

Her husband, however, incandescent with rage, said, \'This man was an absolutely good-for-nothing thief, not Christ!\' So, he and his neighbours went in pursuit of them and caught up with them in one of the villages. Then the pseudo-Christ said to the man who was called Peter, \'My suffering and the cup I am about to drink are approaching\'. Peter said, \'I see they are near at hand for me as well, Lord. But \[Melstinki\] said, \'Peter, I shall be obliged to escape through the window\', and Peter said, \'I shall not abandon you as long as I live. Wherever you run away to, I shall follow\'. So, he fled through the window and the rest of the \'apostles\' also escaped in whatever way they could. The country folk followed them, and felled them with their sticks and clubs, saying, Prophesy to us, Christ and your apostles, in which wood did these sticks grow?\' Having been punished by these blows, therefore, they later amended their life, saying, \'It is difficult for us to undergo Christ\'s Passion and the Apostles\' sufferings\'. This is what the chronicles of Poland say.

Reader, I think you realise that the same spirit of irreligiousness and blasphemy existed in these tricksters as once existed in Cyril, the Arian, and exists later in Calvin and his followers. All have undoubtedly been an instrument of the same Satan. The topic of the Arian Cyril is very well known, and that concerning the Albigensians is well-known from the writings of Lucas de Tuy who lived during that period. \[Juan de Mariana reports several similar things worth reading in Book 12, chapter 1 of his History of Spanish Affairs. Matthieu de Launoi, who kept a record of events, tells us about Calvinists in the Spanish Netherlands in his narrative of the reasons for his conversion from Calvinism to the Catholic religion. Read, if you will be so kind, Reader, his second Defence which he published with his colleague \[Henri\] Pennetier, also a convert. It was printed a few years ago in Paris, but as I do not have the book to hand at the moment, I shall conclude with Apuleius.

\'In front of the Painted Porch \[in Athens\] I saw with my own two eyes a juggler swallow a cavalry-sword which was sharp at one end and had a dangerous point, and not long afterwards I saw the same man plunge a hunting-spear, lethal end first, right down into his guts; and, do you know, from behind the blade of the spear, where the shaft of the inverted weapon went into the man\'s throat, there appeared a pretty, effeminate boy who climbed up and did a dance, writhing round \[the shaft\] in a series of complicated bends and stretches, as though he had not a tendon or a bone in his body, to the astonishment of every one of us who was there\'. There can be no doubt an evil spirit did this by sending images of a false object into \[people\'s\] eyes via the medium of the air which he saturated with them.
[Page 28]

Book 2, Question 9

How remarkable were the effects the ancients attributed to magicians?

Arnobius, Book 1, \[section 43\], dealing with remarkable things done by magicians, calls our attention to their acts of divination and harmful magic \[maleficia\] as the principal things they do. \'Who is not aware that these men either busy themselves trying to find out in advance what is going to happen, things which, whether they like it or not, take place because that is what they have been appointed to do: or to inflict a deadly, wasting disease on anyone they want: or to rupture affection in families: or, without keys, to open things which have been locked: or to render people unable to speak: or to disable, spur on, or hold back the horses during chariot races: or to let loose the flames and furtive desires of forbidden love on wives and licentious foreigners, male or female?\'

In Book 1, chapter 10 of Polycraticus, John of Salisbury says, \'With the Lord\'s permission, they throw the elements into confusion, deprive things of their outward appearance, very often make known things which are going to happen, disturb people\'s minds, send dreams, and kill people simply with the violence of a chanted spell \[carminis\]\', etc. It is not my intention to make a collection of every \[reference\] or to collect a reward for my trouble, but simply \[to bring together\] the references which occur to me now and seem to be particularly worthy of note. Let me start with the North from where, as the prophet testifies, every wicked thing is spread, \[Jeremiah 1.14\]. In his book dealing with the north, Saxo Grammaticus writes that giants and magicians performed an unheard-of kind of wonder by means of various conjuring-tricks and, with their supreme skill in deluding \[people\'s\] eyes, disguised their own faces and those of other people with a variety of images, and hid their true appearances with convincing masks. Olaus Magnus writes about Lapps, Finns, and Biarmi, \[saying\] that they take whatever shape they want and likewise that they spy on what their friends or enemies are doing in another part of the world, and also sell travellers by sea any wind they want for the price of an article of clothing made from linen.

Alessandro Guagnini tells us that beyond the kingdom of Kasan there were three small Tar tar provinces which were unusually addicted to incantations, and that by these means they frequently stirred up fogs and other bad weather in the sky, and in this way overthrew their enemies.⁸⁷

If we proceed from people in general to individuals, a good many \[examples\] present themselves. Zoroaster used to draw things like sparks from the stars. Dositheus performed wonders long ago, but his pupil, Simon Magus, surpassed him-I dealt with his marvels earlier-and Glykas writes briefly in Part 2 \[of his chronicle\] as follows. \'He made statues walk, and when he threw himself into a fire, he was not burned. He would fly into the air, make bread from stones, and flit from one shape to another. Sometimes he would have two faces. He used to change himself into a pillar. He would make closed doors open of their own accord and domestic crockery seem to move of its own accord to perform its duties for humans. \[He made\] ghosts walk in front of him and said they were the souls of dead people. Once, when the Emperor was asking after him, he was struck down by terror, abandoned his own shape, and fled to another one\'. In a later passage, Glykas writes, \'He had a dog chained at the threshold of his house, and this would devour anyone who tried to visit Simon without being invited. The dog told \[St\] Peter to come in and, in a human voice, announced that Peter had arrived\'. You notice the Devil\'s power yielded to the power of God which was in Peter, and that Cerberus fawned upon \[St Peter\] whom he was unable to harm.
[Page 29]

Several people have ascribed what the poets have made up about Orpheus and Amphion and the power of their music to the magic of both men. Pythagoras showed off his golden thigh, tamed an eagle with an incantation, and often used to have a conversation with it. Numa Pompilius put on show the trappings of a sumptuous banquet, even though he had no food at all in the house. Any time Bajan, King of Bulgaria, wanted to change himself into a wolf or some other animal, he was seen to change shape. Did he sometimes do this so that he would not be seen by anyone?⁸⁸ Ollerus used to sail over vast stretches of the sea on an enchanted bone as though it were a ship. Eric, King of the Goths, would draw a favourable wind from wherever he turned his hat, and Philostratus tells us wonderful things about Apollonius \[of Tyana\], and Suidas about Julian the Chaldaean. Both Apuuleius and Anastasius tell us that during the reign of Domitian this Julian surpassed Apollonius in this craft and when it came to checking a plague which had suddenly fallen on Rome. (There is a mention of Julian in Arnobius, Book 1, \[52\].) When two learned men have a rambling conversation while they are putting Vulcan back, Anastasius adds the same thing, and from him Cedrenus \[repeats the information\] that Manetho was so skilled in working magic that he was always openly contemptuous of Apollonius to his face.

Apuleius, himself a magician according to the evidence given by many people, writes about two women who were most deserving of astonishment. First of all he tells us about the landlady of an inn-a \'queen of wise women\', to let you know that even in those days some of them were honoured with that title. 89 \'A wise-woman\', he says, \'has the power of a divinity to bring down the sky and lift up the earth, turn springs into stone and cause mountains to melt away, to raise the spirits of the dead to the surface of the earth and bring the gods down under it, to quench the stars and light up the underworld itself. Because her lover had dishonoured her with another woman, with a single word she turned him into a wild beaver, because when that animal is afraid of being caught, it escapes from those who are chasing it by biting off its genitals, \[her idea being\] that, because he had had sex with another woman, something similar would happen to him.

Since a neighbouring landlord was in competition with her, she changed him into a frog, and now the old man swims around in a barrel of his own wine and speaks to his former customers in polite croaks while he grovels abjectly in the lees. She changed someone else, an advocate who had spoken against her in court, into ram and now that is how he pleads his cases. This same woman condemned her lover\'s wife to perpetual pregnancy, (because she had said something satirical at her expense), by closing up the woman\'s womb and retarding the foetus\'s growth, and according to everyone\'s calculations the poor woman has now been distended for eight years, as though she were going to give birth to an elephant.90 Later on, he says of Pamphile, \'She is believed to be a magician \[maga\] with a very great reputation, and to be mistress of every kind of graveyard incantation. She knows how to plunge the entire light of the starry universe into the depths of the underworld and turn it into its ancient chaos, \[simply\] by breathing on twigs or pebbles or worthless things of that kind. As soon as she catches sight of a good looking young man, she is captivated by his beauty and immediately has no eyes or thoughts for anyone else. She instantly turns those who are of low rank and not complaisant enough into rocks and cattle and any other kind of creature. Others, however, she destroys completely.⁹¹
[Page 30]

Pliny does not trouble himself at all to copy similar stories about Lucian\'s ass, but he does quote Asclepiades scornfully. \'Torrents and standing pools are dried up by throwing the herb aithiops into them, and at its touch anything which is closed is opened. If the herb achaemenis is thrown at an enemy\'s battle-line, the men become alarmed and confused and turn tail. The King of Persia used to give his envoys the herb latace so that they would have plenty of everything wherever they went\'. He says a great deal about the effects of parts of a hyaena, and something much more unbelievable about various stones. \'In Persia, storms are averted by the fumes from \[burning\] agates, and \[the flow of rivers is stopped if the stone resembles a lion\'s skin. \[An agate\] like a hyaena\'s skin averts discord in people\'s houses. The agate which has only one colour makes athletes invincible. Milo \[of Croton\] derived the same power from a cockerel-stone\', etc.⁹²

Now let me turn to poets. According to \[Diogenes\] Laertius, Empedocles boasted considerably in the following vein:

\'You will obtain the drugs with which to drive away illnesses and lighten old age,

And I am communicating them to you alone. By means of your rituals you will restrain the violence of winds Which suddenly spring up and devastate the fields with their raging blasts.

If you wish, you will soon rouse sluggish streams \[to run\] high And bring back fine weather from the midst of a storm. You will bring health-giving showers in the midst of summer, And the winds which blow over everything when the harvest is dry, And you will recall a dead person from the black underworld.

He also adds, from the histories of Timaeus, that whenever the etesian winds were blowing so strongly that they flattened the crops, Empedocles ordered that donkeys be flayed and after \[their skins\] had been turned into bags, he said they were to be moved to hills and the tops of mountains to collect the breezes.

Once the winds had stopped because of this, he was known as the xwhuoavéMas \[wind-stopper\]. This single author from the Greeks is enough. There is a greater abundance of Latin witnesses who have described these things in greater and more elegant detail.

Vergil: \'Magical chants can draw down the moon from the sky. With magical chants Circe changed Ulysses\'s comrades. By magical chanting the cold snake is burst open in the meadows\', etc. \'Moeris himself gave me these herbs and these poisons which he gathered in Pontus. They grow very plentifully in Pontus. I have seen Moeris often become a wolf and hide himself in these woods, And often summon souls from the depths of their graves, And draw away to someone else\'s \[land\] corn already sown,\' \[Eclogue 8.69-71, 95-99\].

In his Metamorphoses, after Ovid has told the story of Ulysses\'s companions being turned into pigs, he expatiates on Circe\'s love and hatred for King Picus, among other things, and about Camens, or Canens, Picus\'s wife.

\'She was remarkable for her beauty, but even more remarkable for the way she sang, Which is why she was called \"Canens\". She would make woods and rocks move, Soothe wild creatures, and interrupt the flow of long rivers With her voice and hold back roaming birds \[from flying away\]\'.

A little later, he tells us about Circe herself, who had caught sight of Picus and had fallen violently in love with him. She says,

\'But you will not escape, \[even if\] the wind is allowed to carry you away, If I know myself, if the power of my herbs has not vanished entirely, And my magical chants do not fail me\'. She finished speaking and fashioned the likeness of a non-existent boar without a body, And told it to run across in front of the King\'s eyes And seem to go into a grove where the trees were thick.
[Page 31]

While Picus came along with his horse in pursuit of the non-existent boar, she overtook him and, with words and a wicked spell, lured him into an act of passion.

\'She took to prayer and spoke words of supplication, And entreated unknown gods with an unknown incantation, One with which she was also accustomed to disfigure the face of the snowwhite moon And affix to its ancient head clouds which suck up moisture. Then, too, by chanting an incantation she made the sky grow dense, And the earth breathed forth mists\', etc.

But when the man chastely rejected the adulterous woman, she became mad with rage.

\'Then she turned twice to the west and twice to the east. She touched the young man three times with her wand, and three times spoke her incantations\'.

He was changed into a bird and saw feathers on his body. Finally, when his servants used threats to demand their king \[be released\] from the power of her harmful magic, She inflicted harm upon them by sprinkling them with poisonous slime and juices, And summoned Night and the gods of night from Erebus and Chaos, And prayed to Hecate with drawn-out wailing cries. The woods-marvellous to relate-leaped up from their place, The ground groaned, the neighbouring trees turned pale, She sprinkled the animals\' fodder and made it wet with drops of blood. It seemed as though the stones were producing hoarse bellowings, That dogs were barking, that the earth was squalid with black snakes, And the thin souls of the silent \[dead\] were flitting about. These evil portents filled the astonished crowd with panic. She touched the amazed faces of the panic-stricken with her magically poisonous wand, And at its touch the monstrous appearances of various wild beasts Fell upon the young men. No one retained his own shape\'.

Of Medea he says in his foolish way, \'She strives to draw down the unwilling moon from its course And to hide the horses of the sun in darkness. She curbs waters and makes winding streams stand still. She moves woods and living rocks from their place. She wanders among \[newly-dug\] graves, noticeable because of her loose hair, And collects particular bones from pyres which are still hot. She curses people who are not there, fashions images out of wax, And drives thin needles into their wretched liver\', \[Heroides 6.85-92\].

Tibullus: \'As a truthful wise-woman \[saga\] Promised me with the aid of her magic. I have seen her bring down stars from the sky, And turn the course of a fast-flowing river with a spell. She has split open the ground with an incantation, drawn the spirits of the dead from their graves, And called down bones form a pyre which was still hot. Now she rouses the companies of the underworld with her magical hissing, Now she sprinkles them with milk and sends them back again. When she pleases, she drives clouds from a gloomy sky. When she pleases, she calls up snows from the summer sky. She is said to be in possession of Medea\'s herbs And to be the only one who has tamed Hecate\'s dogs. She has composed for me incantations with which you could deceive \[people\]. Intone them three times and spit when you have finished chanting. \[Your husband\] will not be able to believe anyone who \[tells him\] about us, Not even himself if he were to see us \[together\] on a soft bed.

You must, however, have nothing to do with other men, because he will see everything else. It is only in my case he will see nothing at all. What shall I believe? This woman has certainly said She can destroy my loves with her incantations or herbs\', \[Elegies 1.2.4363\].

Elsewhere this same poet \[says\],

\'Surely some old woman has not cursed you in the silence of the night With her incantations and herbs that make people pale? A magical chant draws crops from your neighbours\' fields. A magical chant stops an angry snake in its tracks. A magical chant tries to draw down the moon from her chariot, And would do so if trumpets did not sound from far away\', \[Elegies 1.8.1722\].
[Page 32]

Propertius, Book 1, Elegy 12: \'Were we at risk of envy? Surely a god has not crushed me? Or is it a herb, picked on the heights of Causasus, which has separated \[us\]? I am not the man I was\', \[vv.9-n\].

Petronius Arbiter introduces a wise-woman \[saga\] who boasts in the following fashion:

\'Whatever you see in the world obeys me. The earth, which abounds with flowers, Becomes listless when I wish it, and withers when its juices have dried up. It pours forth its riches when I wish it, and a crag with its bristling rocks Hurl out their native waters. The sea submits motionless Waves to me, and the west winds place their silent blasts At my feet. Rivers obey me. So do Hyrcanean tigresses, and snakes I have commanded to stand still. Why am I telling you about quite trivial things? The image of the moon comes down, Drawn by my incantations, and Phoebus in alarm is compelled To turn round his frenzied horses, once I have rolled back the vault \[of the sky\]. So great is the power of words. The fiery passion of bulls dies down, xtinguished by a virgin\'s rites, and Circe, Phoebus\'s daughter, too, Has changed Ulysses\'s companions with her magical incantations,\' \[Satyricon 134\].

Nemesianus, a writer of eclogues, \[says\]:

\'She chanted the incantation which makes the moon swell up and a snake burst open, Crags to run, crops to leave their field, and a tree to be uprooted, \[Eclogue 4.70-71\].

The prince of the Latin lyric \[in his description\] of three very beautiful wisewomen \[sagae\] says this about Folia:

\'She snatches down the stars and the moon she has enchanted With her Thessalian voice\'.

In the same poem, Canidia chants:

\'Not because of the usual potions, Varus, (Believe me, you are going to be in floods of tears!) Will you come running back to me; and your right mind Will return, but not because it has been summoned by Marsian incantations. I shall prepare something stronger, since you disdain me. I shall pour you a stronger dose. And the sky will sink below the sea With the earth stretched out \[over both\] Before you fail to burn with love for me, Like pitch with its black fires\'.

And presently \[she says\]:

\'I can make waxen images move, As you know yourself, thanks to your curiosity; And with my incantations I can tear down the moon from the sky.

I can rouse the dead after they have been cremated, And make potions which excite desire.

More accurately than anyone else although, because of his overblown diction and lofty arrogance, somewhat obscurely, Marcus Lucan \[says\] of Erichtho:

\'By means of Thessalian women\'s incantation love, which has not been prevailed on by the Fates, Has flooded into hearts hardened \[against it\], And grace old men have burned with illicit flames. Nor is it only their noxious Potions, or the pledges of future love for their young, which they remove, Swollen with juice, from \[a foal\'s\] forehead, which have an effect.⁹⁷ Even when it has not been defiled by the bloody matter of the poison someone has drunk, Once the mind has been enchanted, it perishes. Those whom the harmony of married sex And the power of a seductive shape does not bind together, \[These women have influenced by means of the magic whirling of a twisted thread.⁹⁸ Nature\'s changes have ceased. Drawn out by a long night, Daylight sticks fast. The upper air has not obeyed the law. The headlong sky has become sluggish because it has listened to their incantation, And while he bears down on the heavens which are driven forward on their swift axles, Jupiter is amazed they are not loving. Now \[the women fill everything With rain, and draw clouds in front of hot Phoebus, And the sky thunders without Jupiter\'s knowledge. With these same incantations
[Page 33]

\[The women\], their hair flowing loose, have driven far away The damp mists and rainclouds. Since the winds are abating, The sea swells high. Forbidden once again to experience storms, It is silent while the south wind is throwing it into confusion, and the sails which carry the ship, Have swollen against the wind. A torrent has hung from a steep cliff, Stuck fast, and a deep-flowing stream has run In a quite different direction. Summer has not brought a rise in the \[waters of the Nile; The Meander sends its waters in a straight line, and the Arar Has dashed headlong upon the sluggish Rhône. Mountains have lowered their summit and loosened their ridges. Olympus Has looked up at the clouds; and when winter was making things stiff \[with ice\], Even though the sun had not been shining, the snows in Scythia have melted away.

The Thessalian women\'s incantation has driven back from the shore they were defending The sea-goddess Tethys who was urged forward by the moon. The earth, too, has violently shaken the axes of her steady weight And, because of the exertion as she bends towards the centre of her sphere, has tottered. The cargo of such a great mass, struck by the incantation, Has fallen back and given a sight of the sky gliding round it. Every living creature with the power to kill, and which was born to do harm, Also dreads the Thessalian women and provides their practices with \[the means of death. Greedy tigresses and the noble anger of lions Fawn upon these women. The snake unfolds his icy coils for them And stretches himself out upon the ploughed and frosty ground. Knotted vipers burst open their body and unite again, And a snake drops dead, breathed on by human poison,\' \[Pharsalia 6.452-491\].

A few verses later, \[he says\]: \'By those women the stars were first Brought down from the sky as it rushed headlong, and the cloudless moon, Besieged by the dreadful poisons of their incantations, Looked pale and burned with dark light from the earth, Just as if the earth were stopping her brother\'s reflection, And inserting its shadows in the way of the flames from heaven. Pressed down \[under the weight of the incantation, she suffers these great pains Until, having come nearer \[the earth\], she deposits foam on the herbs beneath her\', \[Pharsalia 6. 499-506\].

No less learnedly, Lucan\'s uncle, famous for comedy and tragedy in what remains of \[ancient\] drama in Latin, my favourite, Seneca.

\'Now, summoned by my rites, come, planet of the nights, Assume your most evil aspects, threatening in every one of your faces. For you, after the custom of my tribe, I have set free my hair from its bonds And have wandered your secret groves with naked feet. I have summoned water from clouds which have no rain, And driven the seas down to their depths; and Ocean Has sent his heavy waves further inland, since his tides have been overwhelmed. Because the law of the upper air has been thrown into confusion, The world has seen the sun and moon side by side and, 0 Bears, You have touched the sea which is forbidden to you. I have changed the sequence of the seasons. The summer earth has shuddered at my incantation And Ceres, under this compulsion, has seen harvest in winter. The Phasis has returned its violent streams to their source And the Ister, divided between so many mouths, has squeezed together Its savage waves and is sluggish on all its banks. The surge has resounded, the maddened sea thundered, Yet the wind is silent. The shelter of the ancient grove Has lost its shadows at the command of my incantation. Phoebus has abandoned the day and has come to rest in mid-sky; And the Hyades, moved by my incantations, are ready to fall\', \[Medea 750769\].
[Page 34]

According to Seneca, the nurse claims no less for herself:

I have commanded a grove to bloom in the midst of winter\'s cold, And a discharged thunderbolt to halt in its tracks. I have stirred up a strait, Even though there was no wind, and I have calmed the wild sea; And the dry earth has opened up with fresh streams of water. Rocks have begun to move. I have burst open the doors Of the underworld and \[scattered\] its ghosts, and at my prayer of command The spirits of the dead talk, and the dog of the underworld has spoken. The sea, the land, the sky, and the underworld are my servants. The middle of the night has seen the sun, and day \[has seen\] night, And at my incantations, nothing keeps its laws\', \[Hercules Oetaeus 452463\].

Finally, the labour and study of my youth, Claudian:

\'Because I have magical power, and there is in me An ardent desire to foresee the future. I know with which incantation A Thessalian woman tears away the radiance of the moon, what power The wise Egyptian\'s hieroglyphs have, and the technique whereby the Chaldean tribe Commands the gods it has summoned. The juices which flow From trees and the power of deadly \[herbs\] are not unknown to meWhatever flourishes on the Caucasus, rich with lethal plants, and blooms on the crags of Scythia\[Herbs\] which savage Medea and cunning Circe gathered. I have quite often propitiated the frightening spirits of the dead, and Hecate, With rituals done at night, and by means of my incantations Dragged corpses back to life after they have been buried. I have also destroyed many people with my chanting, Even though the Parcae were still spinning their threads. I have compelled oak-trees to wander about and a lightning-bolt to halt in its tracks.

I have bent rivers and turned them round to flow backwards And return to their sources. So that you may not think That perhaps I have told you lies, see how your own house has changed\'. She finished speaking. The snow-white pillars, to his amazement, began To change themselves into gold, and the roof-beams suddenly Started to gleam with precious metal, \[Against Rufinus 1.145-163\].

This vaingloriousness claims so many things for itself, and such great things, too. Some of them are untrue, some of them true; but which are false and which are true I now have to discuss because other people have failed to do so. By using a reliable method, I shall reduce the whole subject to its principal headings, always bearing in mind that magicians can do whatever an evil spirit can do because of the pact between them, and that magicians cannot do anything an evil spirit cannot do.

Book 2, Question 10

What power do magicians have over the natural order and the laws of the universe?

Magic, as you have read, boasts that Nature obeys her and that she is superior to all the laws of the universe.

\'The sea, the sky, the land, the underworld are my servants. At my incantations, nothing keeps its laws\', \[Seneca, Hercules Oetaeus, 461 and 463\].

This is absolutely untrue. It is something reserved to Almighty God alone. One cannot change the natural order, only Nature\'s creator \[can do that\]; and one cannot abrogate the laws of the universe, only the one who put them firmly in place \[can do that\]. It is a theological principle, well known and firmly established, that nothing which can go beyond Nature can be done by local motion, (which is the unmediated action of an evil spirit), or by the application of active and passive things through alteration, corruption, or generation, (which are his mediated actions), and likewise anything whereby that order or the law of the universe may be changed. This is what St Augustine and St Thomas \[Aquinas\] say, and is proved by Scholastics on the authority of St Paul: \'God has not made the world which is to come subject to angels\', \[Hebrews 2.5\], although in fact according to the not incorrect interpretation of St \[John\] Chrysostom, Theophylact, St Thomas \[Aquinas\], and \[Adam\] Sasbout, those words deal rather with the new world or the Church whose head is Christ, something St Paul \[speaks about\] more than once. They prove this by the somewhat better argument that the part cannot be more than the whole, and from this axiom one deduces many specific points.
[Page 35]

\(i\) Magicians cannot produce any substantial or accidental form directly with the assistance of an evil spirit, because the law of Nature is that a physical substance cannot be altered directly by something which is non-physical. The Devil is non-physical, but those forms have to be brought out from the potentiality belonging to a physical object. Hence it follows that the Devil cannot directly imprint any physical, permanent property-for example, heat, cold, whiteness, etc.

\(ii\) They cannot create anything properly speaking, as it were \'out of nothing\', because the action of a natural cause does not extend to something which does not exist. This is \[an ability\] which belongs to the infinite Power.

\(iii\) They cannot make anything from any natural object, either, because they cannot introduce a form directly. In order to introduce a form indirectly, they have to start with an appropriate ordering \[of their material\], but no object is capable of \[receiving\] every arrangement of material which every form requires. Hence it is that they cannot achieve any effect by means of an instrument or cause, the reason being that on the one hand they depend on the pact they have made, which prescribes specific ways of operating, and on the other, since they are not operating directly, the cause or instrument must be proportionate to the effect.

\(iv\) They cannot, as I said, produce substantial forms without arranging the material in advance and making alterations to it. They cannot do this instantaneously, (because created things cannot make things happen except in time), and they cannot, however much they want to, bring anything to completion in a small or uniform amount of time, because more time is required for one thing and less for another according to whether more arrangement \[of material\] is required for one thing than for another, or \[that arrangement\] is more complete in one than in the other.

\(v\) In accordance with a presupposition made by Aristotle and his followers, which is quite welcomed in the Peripatetic Lyceum and schools of theology, they cannot introduce a vacuum into Nature or, in fact, anything which has no limit to it. They cannot return from a state of deprivation to one of being in possession, nor can they change or overturn the order which exists between the forms of things in Nature and the ways in which their matter is arranged by introducing extremities and overlooking what lies between them, or by doing things which come later before those which come first. They cannot transfer one end of an object to the other without transmitting what lies in the middle, nor can they move an object a long way away from itself, because the mover and what is moved have to exist in a place simultaneously-otherwise it would follow that they could move an object through a vacuum or through any kind of intervening space-and an object cannot move or be transferred in an instant or at any speed one may want, because there are specific boundaries which place a limit on the power of objects to move.

Therefore, what Tertullian wrote, \'Evil spirits are everywhere in a single moment, and likewise, \'The whole world is a single place to them\', needs to be understood properly,¹⁰¹ because one is not right to say, for example, that \'the whole world is a single place to them\' means they are in the east in such a way that they are not, at that moment, in the west. They are either in a place because their substance is there, (which is more likely), or (as many people interpret it) by applying their power, \[they make\] the place they are occupying adequate and their own. In everyone\'s opinion, \[an evil spirit\] has a specific, limited range of movement proportionate to his power or his substance. To be everywhere and to fill everything belongs to God alone. \[An evil spirit\] has also acquired the ability to move so fast that human beings can scarcely detect his movement.
[Page 36]

\(vi\) Because it has been said it is not possible to remove the connection between and subordination of the \[various\] parts of the universe, it also follows it is not possible to remove their being preserved, which is the reason for and intention of that order and connectivity. Furthermore, there follow what I shall be saying in the next question about the movement of the heavens and the removal of the elements from one place to another. It also follows that it is not possible to impede them proximately and directly, (which is what God was doing when He preserved the martyrs unharmed in such varied and immense torments). It is not possible, I say, to impede the action of a natural agent this way, because \[the agent\] has everything it needs to act. In this connection, however, it is possible \[to act\] indirectly by interposing some device or medicine, as human beings do, namely, in the first place, when one provides a contrary cause which stops the power of the other cause from making an appearance-for example, if one were to throw into a flame a napkin made from the soft threads of the stones which people bring from Carystus, and which are woven into something like fabric, it would not only not be burned, but would come out more brilliant and more beautiful. Likewise, if you bring an adamas towards a lodestone, \[the lodestone\] will be prevented from attracting iron.

If by chance the Devil deceived pagans when he prevented a flame from burning the hair of Iulus, or Servius Tullius, or Lucius Marcius, or the tunic belonging to Anagnini\'s servant, it is still possible for other things to be offered by way of explanation for such a well-known prodigy. These fires, you see, were that kind of flame popularly known as \'will-o\'-the-wisp\'. It is explained by natural philosophers as follows. Vapours from cold and extremely condensed air are retained near us. Later, because certain vapours are violently compressed as they follow one another in turn, they heat up and burst into flame. They also take on different colours and shapes according to whether the exhalation is thicker or thinner, and in accordance with the different ways in which it has fashioned itself. The flame looks red or black when the material is thicker, whiter and brighter when it is thinner, and it displays the rest of its different appearances because of the way its light is reflected. Apparitions of this kind-the French call them des aduis, the Germans Stallichten also appear in between horses\' ears, or above the top of human beings\' heads when the humans are growing violent because of wine or anger, or for some other reason. \[They also appear\] next to grave-stones, cremations, or gibbets because sticky vapours come out of dead bodies, and that movement, it is said, makes those vapours burst into flame. They are thought to go before or come after a traveller because a human being moves the air because he is moving at quite a pace. Therefore, if you try to catch hold of them, they seem to run away from the air which you have thrust aside.

I have read a recent writer, a lawyer, who thinks that all these things are evil spirits\' tomfoolery, and that there is a wicked genie innate in these fires. \'Why otherwise\', he says, \'do they lure human beings into the whirlpools of marshes and rivers, and precipitous places?\" They do not lure them, my fine fellow. It simply happens that the silence of night and the novelty of the flame induce fear and consternation in those who do not know what is causing it, make people stray from their path, and so rush into some kind of danger, especially rivers and marshes; and just as the flames Etna belches forth are carried into the strait, these fires, by their very nature, are also borne towards water, as \[Pierre\] Le Loyer corrected observed in his book on ghosts, Book 1, chapter 5. So those who have been thrown into confusion, or frightened, or led by curiosity, follow them and often run into danger of being drowned. If by any chance at some time or another one finds out there has been an external compulsion \[on them\] to follow \[the fires\], that is certainly not natural, but the work of an evil spirit, because I do not deny that sometimes it can happen that an evil spirit joins himself to these flames. But since I believe these flames have a natural explanation, I do not think one should take refuge, as the common folk do, in unnatural explanations.
[Page 37]

But why are horses\' ears or people\'s heads not scorched by them? I should think the reason is that, if we follow the opinion of ancient natural philosophers, there are two types of, or rather parts to, fire: the flame and the live coal. The live coal has the natural property of burning but does not emit light. Flames, however, emit light and burn when the flame is one which is complete. When it is not complete, as is the case we are dealing with here, it is able to emit light, but does not have the power to burn; and the name \[ignis fatuus: \'silly fire\'\] is a good enough indication that this is not a real, complete fire, but one which is like fire, just as the wild fig and the dried fig is not a real fig, but something degenerate which looks like a fig. \[The ancient writers\] confirm this, because they tell us that a flame comes out of \[a rock\] at the waters of Scantia. \'It is weak when it comes out and cannot last long in a different material. Above this burning spring is an ash-tree which conceals it and is noticeably always green\'. This would not be the case if the flame were real and complete. Such, too, is that brilliant white fire which appears to sailors after a storm and, while resting confidently on top of the mast and tackle of ships, does not set fire to anything. (The pagans called this the white star of the Dioscuri or the Castors. To us it is St Elmo.)

See now the remarkable weather-observation by the idle prattler Luther, (Commentary on Genesis, chapter 6, folio 146), where he argues about the rainbow. Not content with mixing up a rainbow with a halo or circlet, he adds, \'I have no doubt that leaping nanny-goats, flying snakes, and suchlike are brought about by evil spirits \[malorum spirituum\] larking about like this in the air, either to frighten or deceive human beings. The heathen declared that the flames appearing on ships were Castor and Pollux. Sometimes, too, a moon appears above the ears of horses. It is certain that all these are the frolickings of evil spirits in the air\'. Thus he, with his \'It is certain\' and \'I have no doubt\' overturns natural philosophy and provides no reason for doing so with the same authority he used to overturn the Faith, appropriating authority to himself in the case of Nature, just as he did in the case of God. He calls \'the moon\' what I said are little flames, although if he actually did see a moon resting upon horses\' ears, he did so when he was moon-struck \[lunaticus\]. Yet he thinks this \'is a very well-established, very reliable demonstration\'-the words are his-\'that all those \"impressions\", as they are called, are the works of God or even of evil spirits\'. The rainbow and, indeed, a comet are, according to him, \[works\] of God: everything else \[is the work\] of evil spirits. Let those who like being silly take pleasure in this kind of learned man!

Now, I have read about roaming balls of flames which emit a human sound, and about a corpse\'s right arm which was amputated, along with the shoulder blade and ribs, for use as a light during the night. The ends of its fingers burned with a sulphurous, violet-coloured flame so that witches \[striges\] could pour all their wicked venom upon someone who was sleeping and complete what they had decided to do. When at length the flame was put out, the fingers were as whole and uninjured as if they had not been a source of light earlier. Rémy claims that female magicians \[magas\] do this as often as they want, and has quite rightly attributed the entire thing to the cunning tricks of an evil spirit. On the other hand, when Claudius Claudian says that the snows on the summit of Etna remain unaffected because the immense heat \'under the snows protects them\', and \'its harmless flame licks the frosts next to it\', this is not a myth, because historians and natural philosophers vouch for it.
[Page 38]

But it is one of Nature\'s hidden mysteries. Perhaps a flame ejected too forcibly has less effect when it touches so fleetingly the things which lie around it? If this is true, it relates to a method of preventative action which happens later on, because the other mode of preventative action takes place via a swift, violent movement of the air in between, whereby a natural action is prevented from penetrating an object, just as we are accustomed to move the air to drive away smoke so that it doesn\'t harm our eyes, and just as the Devil did, too, so that the water Tuscia the Vestal was carrying in her sieve would not spill out. This is also how the apparition of a malevolent evil spirit stopped the flame which had been thrown into the shrine of Jupiter at Apamea from destroying it until, by a miracle from God, a sprinkling of holy water drove the evil spirit away. Likewise, poets write that Medea\'s incantations made the breath of flame-vomiting bulls harmless, because the Devil always tries to imitate God\'s miracles. One knows that \'by faith\' saints \'have quenched the assault of fire\', as St Paul says, (Hebrews 11.34), as did the three Jewish children, (Daniel chapter 3), St Francesco di Paola, and others.

I shall be content with a single example in which the merit of religious or blind obedience, along with faith, also shines forth. \[Bernardino\] Scardeone writes as follows. \'It happened once, perhaps by chance, that an Augustinian prior there was invited to lunch and sat down with these people\', (the Jesuit followers of the Blessed \[Giovanni\] Colombini). \'After the food and drink had been removed and the spectators had withdrawn, and permission to speak had been given, he started to discourse, interminably and arrogantly, about the merits of the way Dominicans made their vows, tacitly reproving \[the Jesuates\] because, although they were counted as monks, they would not publicly and openly acknowledge their profession of the three vows along with all other monks in accordance with the usual form. To this the superior of the Jesuits, an uneducated individual, to be sure, but a clever man and one who was dear to God, craftily replied, \"Father\", (he said), \"since we happen to be having conversation along these lines, do you want one of our brothers, who has offered himself to God in a straightforward way, or that companion of yours who has made his three vows in public, to show us who is the more genuinely obedient to his superior?\" \[The prior\], not realising \[what he was doing\], willingly agreed. Then the Jesuit turned straight away to our Brother Marcus who happened to be serving those seated at table and said, \"Brother Marcus, these friends of ours are cold.

By virtue of holy obedience, go quickly to the kitchen and bring them burning coals in your bare hands, so that they can warm up straight away\". \[Marcus\] did not hesitate, (because he was quick to do as he was told), and believing there would be nothing he could not do if commanded under the rule of obedience, without any hesitation quickly carried from the kitchen to the table as many burning coals as he could in his cupped hands without any damage or harm to himself, and offered them to each man so that he could relieve his cold. Then, on the order of his superior, to everyone\'s astonishment he took them back again whence he had brought them. The Dominican \[i.e. Augustinian\] prior I mentioned, immeasurably taken aback by this, looked at his companion as if he were about to tell him to do the same at once, but he, realising the situation, came to the conclusion he should not hesitate and immediately burst out as follows. \"Reverend Father, for goodness\' sake don\'t order me to tempt God. If you want, I shall bring fire in a sherd as I usually do, but not in my hands\". But they, filled with astonishment on account of such a great miracle, were silent and stunned on the one hand, and on the other, pleased by their comrade\'s unexpected reply, looked at each other and smiled.
[Page 39]

Any enemy of the Jesuits may perhaps smile while he is reading this, but Scardeone was not a Jesuit and, frankly, his knowledge of the Jesuits, who had not long arrived in Padua at that time, was very scanty. He calls us \'priests of the name of Jesus\', (Book 22, class 5, folio 95). But in the story I have just quoted, (Book 2, class 6, folio 113), he calls people \'Jesuits\' when their correct name is \'Jesuates\'. The founder of the Order was Blessed Giovanni Colombini and almost every one of them was a layman. The founder of our Order was St Ignatius Loyola, and in each of our houses there are many priests. They were confirmed in 1369 by Pope Urban v; we were first confirmed later, in 1540, by Paul III. They are called Jesuates of St Jerome; we are called clerics of the Society of Jesus. (For information about them, read Paolo Morigia\'s book on the origin of religious Orders, chapters 33 and 35. For information about us, read the life of Fr Ignatius Loyola, accurately recorded by Fr Pedro de Ribadeneira and Fr Pietro Maffei).

Scardeone, therefore, like everyone else who mixes up the name \'Jesuits\' and \'Jesuates\', was in error and because of this mistake Bartolommeo Fumo, without sufficient thought in his book The Golden Bracelet: What Religion Says, no. 4, says that Jesuits are not, properly speaking, members of a religious Order, and he praises the author Abbas\'s rules in the case of Regulars, number 3, although Abbas simply writes that they are not properly called \'Regulars\'. This, too, is false because Jesuits are Regulars on both counts since their clerics profess a specific Rule and are members of a religious Order. For instance, they take the three solemn vows which Abbas says are necessary and, notwithstanding there are those who do not take them, the Supreme Pontiffs Gregory XII and Gregory XIII defined that, by taking simple \[vows\], they are members of a religious Order. So Abbas was factually mistaken and Fumo quoted Abbas\'s opinion in ignorance. Both of them, however, were talking about the foresaid Jesuates since in Abbas\'s time there was no thought of Jesuits yet.

The books of Abbas, Fumo, and Scardeone should be corrected, and I am surprised this has not been noticed by those who have been in charge of recent editions. Fumo is clearly worthy of forgiveness if he wrote before the Society of Jesus was established. \[John\] Bale remains unworthy of forgiveness. In his list of the writers of Britain, the Englishman adds little stories, (as those people usually do), and tells us that \[Jesuits\] are Theatines and were first established in Venice by Paolo Carafa who later became \[Pope\] Paul IV. One is not particularly surprised at this. Our name was not known to the English Calvinist, but one can be astonished at his obvious malice. Then there is the Parisian advocate, \[Jean\] Papire Masson, who had lived not a few years in our Society. His stupidity resulted in his becoming a pettifogging ranter in the law-court, and he left our Society because of his scurrilousness in railing in our name, as though he were taking part in a tournament. In poems on the life of Pope Paul IV, he writes that in Spain we are \'Ignatians\' and that in Nola in Campania we are called \'Jesuins\', which is what he calls us.

Why? In order to give the impression of knowing \[what he was talking about\] and to cover up his apostasy. He had a very poor knowledge of those from whom he defected so unwisely and with such a bad example. If he knew them so little, why and how did this examiner of hearts and minds thrust himself into the secret places of the heart \[in such a way\] that he is not in the least afraid to claim that \[Jesuits\] alone think they have a contract to belong to Jesus\'s fellowship, and that in this they are inordinately shrewd because they think they are going to command Heaven or, on occasion, \[Jesus\] Himself? How could someone who had explored such deeply buried secrets of their heart have been ignorant of what they are called? If he had not known what they are called, he could not have thrust himself into these deep hiding-places of the heart. I think you are a spiritual apostate. It is the irrational habit of brutish people to try to rip to pieces, with a mouth full of nonsense and a poisonous tongue, those they have abandoned because they would not put up with being corrected, so that it does not look as though they deserted them for no good reason.
[Page 40]

I now return to my subject from the digression into which I was dragged by Scardeone.

Book 2, Question 11

What power do magicians have over heavenly bodies, the stars, and the elements?

As I pointed out in the preceding question, one has to put up with Empedocles\', Sosiphanes\', Apollonius\', Vergil\'s, and other poets\' attributing far too much to magicians. One has to put up with it because they were pagans. But who can put up with a Christian, and one who is a Catholic, who likes to listen to someone in The Transgressor Bound reciting the following verses

\'Words, for example, can stop the wandering stars high in the sky, Words can guide the powerful moon at night which is heathenish, stupid, and completely incredible. (i) It is not possible to arrest the movement of the stars by magic, or to turn them back in their ordained courses, because this would be to throw the order of the universe into confusion. This ruins the ancient story about drawing down the moon. It no more agrees with reason than the more recent silly notion of a certain nation in our time, which thinks that the moon was swallowed by an ass because a herd of animals in Arcadia drank from a river in which, as does happen, the face of the moon was shining while \[the herd\] was drinking, and when \[the animals\] moved away the moon could not be seen because it was suddenly hidden by a cloud. Consequently, the people threw the unfortunate rider of Silenus into prison, fell on a colt, cut open its belly, and disembowelled it in a most savage fashion in order to restore the moon to the world. St Augustine confirms my conclusion that the origin of the story stems from not knowing that the moon suffers a loss of light in a natural way. Plutarch also tells us about it, as does an ancient poet, a fragment of whose \[work\] Adrien\] Turnèbe has passed on to us. This \[fragment\] is well worth \[reading\] and is the kind of thing one reads in several places.

\'But let me say why the curved orb, shining along the mass of the earth, Grows livid when the world is tired, And why the brilliant radiance of its snow-white face grows weak. It is not a hateful wailing woman who drags it down below to dusky hollows From its watch-tower which wanders on high. It has not been overcome by an incantation And she \[the moon\] is looking for the conquering clamour. Indeed, through the upper air Where we locate her path, in confusion she separates \[herself\] from the pure \[air\], And passes on, inviolate. But the earth, Which occupies mid-heaven at its lowest point with her vast bulk, Holds back the light \[of the moon\'s\] brother By means of turning-points which cast a shade. Then, When the star is without purpose, The smooth shadow of her chariot grows pale during the time it is swiftly crossing The axis of the heaped up mound \[of earth\]. Once set free, she restores her brother\'s flames To the rose-coloured watch-tower throughout the sky.

Later on, he adds, most eloquently, a great deal whereby he confirms this opinion. (It will be possible to read there who the text of the ancient authors is talking about).

\(ii\) \[Magicians\] cannot transfer an entire element from its natural place to somewhere else. The reason is the same as that \[I gave\] in the preceding conclusion. It is an opinion common to theologians and is what Firmilianus meant when he wrote to St Cyprian, \[Letter 74.10\]. Earthquakes, however, can make this happen-certainly after any violent exhalation has been discharged into hollow places in the earth, or air which is shut up in the bowels of the earth has been violently disturbed. It is not only poets who claim that magicians command the winds. So does Philostratus when he writes that when he was among the Brahmins \[of India\], Apollonius saw two large jars, and once these were opened, storms and winds used to burst out, but when they were closed, fine weather and calm air would return, \[Life of Apollonius 3.14\]. The natural philosopher Sopater, too, was put to death because he was accused of fettering the winds by means of a magical incantation so that the harvest could not be brought to Byzantium. I have already talked about Empedocles and the King whose surname was \'Wind-cap\'.
[Page 41]

\(iii\) (Something which is associated with this.) Magicians can calm storms, rouse flashes of lightning, claps of thunder, hail-storms, and rain-storms. They can also stir up similar kinds of weather and send them against fields they want \[to attack\]. In olden times the philosopher Seneca laughed at this when he wrote as follows:

\'It is incredible that at Cleonae there were people publicly appointed to be халаÇopuráxas \[hail-guards\] to watch out for an approaching hail-storm. When these people had given the signal that such a hail-storm was near at hand, what do you think happened then? That people ran off to get their raincoats or get under cover? Not a bit of it! Each person would offer a sacrifice for his own benefit-one a lamb, another a chicken, and straight away, after they had tasted some of the blood, those clouds would start to veer off in another direction. Does this make you smile? Listen to something which will make you smile even more. If someone did not have a lamb or a chicken, he would lay hands on himself-but not to the extent of doing himself serious hurt, and I should not like to make you think that clouds are greedy or cruel. He would prick his finger with a really sharp pen and make his sacrifice with this blood. The hail would turn away from this man\'s little piece of ground just as much as it would \[from the land\] of someone who had persuaded it to do so by sacrificing bigger victims.

Certain people look for a rational explanation of this practice. One group, as befits people with a very good knowledge of the world, denies that anyone can make a covenant with a hail-storm and buy off storms with paltry \[presents\], even though gifts do prevail even upon the gods. Others say they suppose there is in the blood itself a power which is strong enough to turn and drive away a cloud. But how can there be a power in such a small amount of blood great enough to penetrate the sky and make the clouds feel it? Isn\'t it easier to say that this is a tall story and a lie? But Cleonae used to prosecute those who had been charged with looking out for a storm should it happen that, because of their negligence, vineyards had been beaten down or crops flattened. Here, too, in Rome, the laws of the Twelve Tables forbid anyone from enchanting people\'s crops. An antiquity which was still uneducated used to believe that rain could be attracted and driven away by means of incantations. That this cannot happen is so evident that one need not join the school of any natural philosopher in search of an explanation for it.

How forcibly is he asserting something he did not know? He is sounding off and inventing the false arguments he is refuting himself. He would not have mentioned them at all had he known that these things happened because of a pact with an evil spirit. Those more recent \[writers\], Catholic as well as heretic, who deny-and offer very potent arguments-that a human being cannot create even a single drop of water, (as if I were actually saying that only a human being can accomplish this by his own power), have heard this and have quite often singled it out. But I ascribe it to an evil spirit who is operating in accordance with the pacts he has made. They add that I am irreligious in ascribing this to an evil spirit because in Holy Scripture the origin of snow, hail, rain, and the like is ascribed to God. I was not unaware of this. On the other hand, in various places in Holy Scripture very many things are attributed to God which it is agreed are not beyond human power, such as beating, killing, and curing. But there can be no doubt that God has done all these things as the principal, independent, universal efficient Cause, whereas created beings \[do them as particular, dependent, less than principal efficient causes.
[Page 42]

In his dialogue addressed to the Archduke of Austria, Ulrich Molitor avoids the error of others to some small extent and ingeniously pretends that the Devil cannot disturb the air, cause hailstorms, etc. when he wishes, but offers no proof to explain why he cannot do so. Instead, \[he says\] that when \[the Devil\] foresees that a storm is coming, he incites wise-women \[sagas\] to do what they usually do to cause a storm, and persuades them that the power to whip up a hurricane lies in the things \[they are using\] or in what they are doing. I do not deny that sometimes they are successful, but I maintain that, for the most part, it is quite a different story because wise-women \[sagae\] are unanimous in confessing that they can accomplish these things whenever they want, and experience confirms it every time they are forced \[to confess it\], against their will, by judges. The effect \[they want follows, so an evil spirit is making it happen at the same time as he is given the signal \[to do so in accordance with the pact \[he and the woman have made together. Molitor is also mistaken when he offers extremely jejune, feeble arguments here and in the whole book to prove that an evil spirit cannot do with without God\'s permission. What Catholic has ever said he can? We all say loudly that God\'s permission is necessary, but we maintain that when God gives His permission and natural causes do not get in the way, an evil spirit can do this whenever he wants to, notwithstanding that under those circumstances no storm which is about to happen will have a natural existence.

I know that Burchard, (Decretum Book 19, under the title \"The Practice of Magic\', or \'Have you ever believed\'), denied this and thought that magicians \[magos\] who believed it were superstitious. They are superstitious because they are magicians! Likewise, if they believe they can do these things even when God does not give His permission then, according to this chapter, they become heretics as well.¹²¹ But they are correct in their supposition if they think that, once God\'s permission is in place, they can do this by means of an evil spirit because of the power of the pact they have with him. The entire consequence of these remarks-and this is the common opinion of theologians and legal experts-is proved (i) from Holy Scripture, because there Satan makes fire fall from the sky and consume Job\'s slaves and flocks, and he also rouses a strong wind which overwhelms \[Job\'s\] sons and daughters while they are eating and drinking \[Job 1.16 & 19\]. The orthodox Fathers of the Church tell us that Holy Scripture says the Devil did this. (ii) Holy Scripture specifically says that the hailstorm with which the Egyptians were punished was sent by wicked angels, \[Exodus 9.18\].

\(iii\) Four angels standing at the corners of the earth offer to stop the winds from blowing and thus to inflict very great damage on the living, \[Apocalypse 7.1\]. Many of the saints thought these were demonic spirits \[genios alastores\]. Finally, why does St Paul so frequently call evil spirits \'princes of the air? Mainly because of their great power over the air. Not only does an ancient law of the Twelve Tables, which Pliny and St Augustine praise on that account, confirm this but so do Imperial and Papal decrees. All the Fathers of the Church whom \[Burchard\] cited-Clement, Jerome, Augustine, Andreas \[of Caesarea\], \[Walafrid Strabo\], St Thomas \[Aquinas\], and many others besides: for example, Origen in Against Celsus, Book 8; John of Salisbury, Book 1, chapter 10; and Henricus Teutonicus with whom Thomas of Cantimpré agrees, Book 2, chapter 57, part 29.

\(iv\) It is proved by histories and exemplary stories about the winds and the storm calmed by magicians in the time of Xerxes, as Herodotus bears witness. Olaus \[Magnus\] writes as follows about the Finns and the Lapps. \'Once upon a time they used to offer to sell winds to merchants. They would use magic to consecrate three knots. When \[the merchants\] undid the first knot, they would have calm winds; when they undid the second, the winds would be stronger; and when they undid the third, the winds would be very strong\', \[History of Peoples in the North 3.15\]. Aristaeus once said that the inhabitants of the Cyclades used to attract trade-winds during summer by means of certain rituals and sacrifices, and so, with their pleasant chill, keep the fields free from being squalid and barren. There are also plenty of records kept by the ancients, which deal with showers called down by magicians.
[Page 43]

The Indians in Cianita procure rain by means of a ridiculous ceremony which is described in letters dated 1590 and 1591 from my Jesuit brethren in Peru. Gaspare Spitilli gives the following extract. \'When they are in need of rain, one of their magicians cries out in a loud, impassioned voice, speaking faster and faster, \[saying\] that they must all go to the mountain, and that when they get there everyone must abstain from food according to custom. (This \"fast\" of theirs, however, refers merely to salt, pepper, and cooked food.) When they have done this, they call earnestly upon the stars at the tops of their voices and pray for water. Then they return to their lands and pagan stronghold, taking a certain potion, which they drink when a young girl of a noble family offers it \[to them\]. It causes them to lose their senses and their reason, with the result that they look as though they are dead.

After they have recovered, however, they mingle honey with water and maize and sprinkle the mixture in the direction of the clouds. Next day they place a well-born old man, or at any rate one of good reputation who is held in honour, on a couch and light a slow fire under it. When he starts to sweat, the magician catches the sweat in a jar, mixes it with goose-blood and the water from a crushed root, and again throws this liquid into the air as if to soak the clouds, asking, by the sweat, the blood, and the water, that the water they desire be bestowed upon them; and if by chance it rains on the day they carry out their superstitious ceremonies, they give thanks to the stars and shower the magician with many gifts\'. There can be no doubt that the Devil finds it quite easy to adhere to such an important pact when people demand rain or hail with the intention of ruining others, and he scarcely ever lets them down; but when these Indians demand this favour for everyone\'s use, he makes complete fools of them since their magicians, no less than our diviners \[sortiarii\] operate by means of the power of their pact \[with him\].

This marvel involving water should not surprise anyone, because Pausanias writes that in Hypaepa it is common for a very bright flame to be produced from pieces of wood by means of an incantation in a foreign language, even though no fire has been applied to them, \[Description of Greece 5.27.6\]. Modern writers have published more recent examples, and what Rémy records in The Worship of Evil Spirits, Book 1, chapter 25 of the ritual used by witches \[strigum\] in our day is worthy of astonishment. \'I certainly remember this, which was testified and maintained by the free and voluntary assertion of two hundred people, more or less, whom I, in my capacity as a local magistrate, sentenced to be burned to atone for the crime of fortune-telling \[sortilegii\]. \[They said\] that it was their habit to meet on specific days and assemble on the bank of a fen or brook, especially if there was one which would be well hidden from the eyes of passers-by.

There, with a wand they had been given by an evil spirit, they would keep on beating the water until they raised thick clouds of vapour and steam by which they were all borne aloft together. Then \[they used\] whatever they had stirred up in this fashion to clothe themselves in thick, dark clouds, and after they had enveloped themselves and their evil spirits in them, they would drive and thrust them wherever they wanted and at last shake out a lot of rain and hail on to the lands below. In this case I don\'t think there is any deception involved other than their thinking they are raising those vapours by thrashing \[the water\]. The evil spirit is doing it and carries the witches \[striges\] aloft through the air in those clouds and makes sure they do not suffocate. If those women are being carried along by the clouds, can it be denied that they could fall to earth from the clouds if the evil spirit abandons them?
[Page 44]

But more of this later. Rémy adds that before they beat the water like this, they would sometimes throw into it an earthenware jar in which the evil spirit had enclosed something secret, or even stones the same size they wanted the hail to be when it fell. Sometimes \[they had\] candles which they took down to the fen and held downwards while alight until drops \[of wax\] falling into it had sufficiently tainted the fen. In addition to this, they would sprinkle poisoned dust into the water. They would usually use black wands they had been given by an evil spirit to thrash the water and would beat the water with them without any kind of pause, at the same time repeating the words of dreadful imprecations. Certain women have also confessed that, with the help of an evil spirit, male and female witches drive big-mouthed jars through the clouds as far as a place they have in mind. \[The jars\] then hang upside down over it, are burst open with rocks and flames and, in a swift attack, destroy and pound to pieces anything in their path.

Rémy gives many examples in chapters 25 and 29 of the same Book. Let me add two, one pleasantly amusing, the other ghastly. In the jurisdiction of Trier there was a peasant who, along with his eight-year old daughter, was planting cabbages in his garden. He happened to praise the little girl because she was carrying out this task well and she, a chatterbox because of her sex and age, said she knew how to do other, much more remarkable things. Her father asked her what she meant and she said, \'Stand aside a little and I shall make it rain all of a sudden on any part of the garden you like\'. He was surprised and said, \'All right, I\'ll stand aside\'. So he did so and the little girl dug a trench, poured water into it from her \'feet\'-I\'m using the Hebrew euphemism-stirred the water with a stick, muttered something or other under her breath, and lo and behold, suddenly rain \[fell\] from the clouds on to the designated spot. Her father was astounded. \'Who taught you this?\' he asked. \'Mummy\', she replied, \'and she\'s very good at this and other things like it, too\'. After a few days the farmer, stirred by zeal, pretended that he, his wife, and his daughter had been invited to a wedding. Hastily they dressed up for the wedding and he put them into a wagon, drove them to the nearby town, and handed them over to a judge to pay the penalty for their crime of harmful magic \[maleficium\]. (I was told this story by men whom I find entirely worthy of being believed). If you want to know where the method of making a small trench and using a stick to beat down what you have thrown into it, you can find it in Propertius Book 4, elegy 5 which is about an aged wise-woman \[saga\].

\'In fact, she also brought hillside herbs to the ditch, And anything lying in it would be dissolved into running water\'.

The following exemplary story was recorded by \[Giovanni\] Gioviano Pontano. Ferdinand, King of Naples, was closely besieging the town of Marcos which lay near a fortress situated on Monte Dracone at the end of the Massican Hills, because it favoured the Angers party. A failure of its water-supply had almost forced it to surrender when a number of ungodly priests ventured to use magical practices to draw down rain. They were drawn from townspeople and the besieged who, under darkness of night, deceived the castle-guards and stealthily made their way along very uneven rocks to the shore, hauling with them an image of Christ nailed to the cross. First of all, they loaded it with abuse and frightful incantation, then they cursed it, plunged it into the sea, and invoked a storm from the sky upon the sea and the land. At the same time a number of priests, more villainous than anyone else, (seeing that they were busying themselves in carrying out unholy military manoeuvres to their satisfaction,) performed an abominable ritual whereby, it was said, they thought they could draw down the rain they needed. They stood an ass in front of the door of a church, chanted a deadly incantation, and then thrust a consecrated Host into the roof of \[the animal\'s\] mouth. They repeatedly addressed the ass in loud voices with deadly chants and then buried it alive on that spot in front of the church door. Scarcely had they completed the ritual than the air started to cloud over, winds began to stir up the sea, and darkness to pour over the brightness of midday. At one point the sky would flash with bolts of lightning, at another the light would be snatched away, and the sky and land would quake beneath the thunder. Trees ripped up by the winds were flying \[through the air\], and rocks split open by lightning were filling the air with their fragments. So much rain burst out of the clouds, and so heavy was the downpour, that not only were the cisterns incapable of collecting the water, but they poured out stones and rocks which had been burned and made thirsty by the sun, and torrents \[of water\] which spread out in every direction. Thus, the King, who had relied on taking the town by making it thirsty, was frustrated of his hope and returned to his former camp in Savo\'.
[Page 45]

I have included this the more willingly to warn you, my Reader, that because of misuse and the negligence of bishops, rituals which have crept into certain areas in Germany and Aquitaine involving dragging images of Christ crucified and of saints such as St Martin and St Urban and others in order to procure favourable weather, and against whose use in Cantabria Martin de Arles published his book on superstition, are thought to have originated in the superstition of magic and are quite rightly regarded as suspect, because \[they are based on\] a tacit pact. Vincent de Beauvais also tells us that the people of Constantinople were persuaded by a magician to immerse a statue of the Blessed Virgin in the sea and that it discharged a storm against the Saracens\' fleet. You notice, don\'t you, Reader, that images of the saints are very hateful to an evil spirit? From this perhaps you may understand the spirit \[genio\] which drives the iconoclasts of our day. A canon of the First Council of Braga does not contradict what I am saying at all. It says, \'The kind of person who would believe that any impure created things (e.g. the Devil) make thunder and lightning and storms and droughts on their own authority is anathema, along with Priscillian\'. The real point of the canon, you see, is to condemn those heretics who used to think that the Devil is the prime origin of these things and has the power to create them and can produce them even when God does not allow it. All this is heretical and worthy of the magician Priscillian.

What I am maintaining now is clearly conformable to the principles of divine and human wisdom, and entirely in accordance with our experience not only of rain, hail, and wind, but also of lightning, which has the same explanation. Andrea Cesalpino, an Aristotelian, writes as follows in chapter 11 of his Inquiry into Evil Spirits. \'We have come across men who would stir up not only hailstorms, but lightning, too, but used to say they could not harm anyone they wanted, only those whom God had abandoned\'-that is, in my opinion, who had fallen from God\'s grace through mortal sin. \'One of these men used to do this. He would invoke the prince of evil spirits in open fields and beg him to send one of his servants to strike with lightning someone he \[the magician\] had chosen. Later he would sacrifice a black chicken to him at a crossroad and throw it into the air, and once the evil spirit had received it, the magician would stir up a very violent hurricane, accompanied by lightning. This, however, rarely fell on the individual he had chosen\'. God surely allows an evil spirit \[to do\] more against fields than against human beings!

\(iv\) Just as \[magicians\] can raise storms, so they can summon darkness. I have read in Marco Polo that the Mongols have such power because of their evil spirits\' conjuring-tricks that they can spread darkness when and where they will, and that on one occasion \[Polo\] himself escaped with difficulty from robbers after they had surrounded him with this magic. Hayton also tells us that a Mongol fighting-line was prepared for battle by their flag-bearer, a magician, who chanted a spell and spread deepest darkness over the enemy, and that they were victorious once light had been restored.

\(v\) According to Origen, \[Against Celsus\] Book 8, \[magicians\] can corrupt the air and the water in certain places and render them corrosive and deadly, and this is proved by the argument that they can make them smell dreadful as, for example, \[Mt\] Avernus does in Italy or the Dead Sea in Judaea. Is it easier to believe this of water? When it comes to air, the proof is that although air flows continually, its power of resistance is weak, and it becomes cold or warm for the slightest reason. It is, for example, cold in the morning during autumn, warm at midday, and cool in the evening. So why would something so susceptible to heat be more resistant to a foul smell? Finally, while Maruthes, the Bishop of Mesopotamia, was doing his official duties at the court of Yazdegerd, King of Persia, and Yazdegerd was showing the bishop favour because of his religious devotion, the Magi, fearing for their religion in case the King was going to convert, raised an intolerable stench and made up a false accusation that his Christian friends were responsible for it. But the Magi were arrested and, after a more thorough investigation of the matter, put to death, Nicephorus, History of the Church Book 14, chapter 18.
[Page 46]

\(vi\) Magicians can impede the action of fire in such a way that someone can walk unhurt along burning coals and not be burned, (unless God prevents this, as He does particularly in the case of those sentenced to the fire). Thus, in olden times the priestesses of Diana at Castabala were not harmed by fire, (Strabo Book 5); among the Falisci, the Hirpi would walk through fire unharmed, as Strabo Book 12 and Pliny Book 7, chapter 2 testify. Likewise, they can make sure that no one is drowned in water, as we see happening every day in the ordeal by cold water. They can make rivers temporarily cease to flow, dry up the channels of springs but still allow water to continue \[bubbling up\], wash away rocks and stones with springs they produce from the earth, and interrupt streams and drive them back to their source with the result that they seem to be flowing backwards-something Pliny says happened in his day. Lastly, they can do things connected with the weather by using minerals, although even if these things seem to be extraordinary, they are in fact natural. For example, they collect together aluminous minerals from cavities in the hills, mix them with natron, and set them on fire. This causes a sudden vapour which rises to the mid region of the air where, at length, it resolves itself into rain.

Book 2, Question 12

What power do magicians have over external things, or the good things Fortune brings?

Because human beings are very greedy for these, and the allurements used by an evil spirit are quite remarkable, I shall deal with them individually, proceeding from those which are easier \[to explain\] to those which are more difficult.

\(i\) No one doubts \[magicians\] can kill flocks and cattle. They do this by sprinkling or rubbing poison on them, or by applying it some other way. Occasionally, too, it happens by local motion when an evil spirit enters the animals\' bodies and suffocates them, throws them headlong to the ground, or tears them in pieces; and sometimes, simply because someone has praised them, the evil spirit secretly brings destruction upon them. This is the only way one can explain something \[Aulus\] Gellius wrote. \'Written in those same books I also came across this, which I later read in Book 7 of Pliny the Elder\'s Natural History. In the land of Africa, there are certain groups of people who cast a spell \[effascinatium\] with their voice and what they say. If these people happen to bestow somewhat fulsome praise on beautiful trees, rather extensive cornfields, rather delightful children, very fine horses, or well-fed flocks in excellent condition, suddenly all these things die, punished for no reason other than this\', \[Attic Nights 9.4\].

\(ii\) They can steal away other people\'s harvests and fruits and transfer them elsewhere, as Servius in his commentary on Vergil\'s Eclogues, Apuleius in his Defence, and St Augustine in The City of God, tell us; and this is not surprising, since it is done by an evil spirit simply using local motion. It does not seem to be irrational to suspect that this was the discovery of the magician Dardanus, and certainly in Turnèbe\'s opinion Dardanians are called after Dardanus, \[their name\] meaning \'threshers of grain\' because they were either believed to remove heaps of other people\'s stuff into their own barns by the use of magic or were charged with doing so. A few years ago, while I was staying in Mainz, a very notorious wise-woman \[saga\] was put to death in Trier. She had driven a stopcock in the wall of her house and would draw off all the milk from other people\'s cows-that is to say, an evil spirit would milk the cows and remove the milk very quickly by this means.

\(iii\) They can quite easily destroy any produce and fruits of the earth and make fields barren. The magicians summon an evil spirit with a wicked incantation, and he quickly destroys the crops and the year\'s produce. This is what one should understand by Ovid\'s \[verses\]:
[Page 47]

\'The corn, damaged by an incantation, vanishes into barren grass; The waters of a spring damaged by an incantation fail; Acorns fall from their trees and the enchanted grape from its vines, And the fruit falls, off even though no one is shaking \[the branch\],\' \[Amores 3.7.31-34\].

According to Rémy, they have a habit of sprinkling a tiny bit of dust an evil spirit has given them, and this causes canker-worms, winged and wingless locusts, slugs, caterpillars, and this kind of noxious bane of fields and gardens, to make an immediate appearance. They lay waste to everything, pillage the standing corn, garden-vegetables, fruit, and sometimes the grass itself; and when they have done this, they sometimes raise a large number of mice which bury themselves in the earth straight away and eat the shoots and all the roots. Sometimes they attack draught-animals with a gadfly which, in the end, kills them cruelly with repeated stings. Sometimes they strike a particular herb against a tree and bring wolves out of what appears to be a hollow in the tree to the place where they want them to attack a sheepfold and its flock, and \[the wolves\] do not go away until they have caused great carnage. Rémy records the judicial confessions of all these people in Book 1, chapters 21 and 24, and thinks that the evil spirit does not produce these afflictions afresh for the occasion, but that he gathers things quickly from all over the place into a single spot. There is certainly no doubt at all that \[an evil spirit\] can do this.

It seems likely that, because they harm and lie in ambush for precisely the particular flock and sheepfold to which they have been directed and which the person directing them wants them \[to attack\], those wolves are evil spirits who do this kind of damage under the guise of wolves. We may think that nothing stops an evil spirit from producing locusts and every other insect from material which has been placed here and there, by applying active things to passive, since they can be born from rottenness, although he does this at the time he needs and needs only a very short time \[to do it\]. Fresh examples happen every day, and I have brought together a very large number from other \[writers\]. In Spain I also read the letters of inquisitors who were staying in Pamplona at the time, and these provided evidence that they were coming across this constantly. Some people also find they are convinced by the authority of Supreme Pontiffs whose Bulls on the subject are still in existence-Innocent VIII to the inquisitors of Germany, Julius II to the inquisitor at Cremona, and Hadrian VI to the inquisitors of Lombardy. (See \[Bartolomeo della\] Spina, Inquiry into Witches, chapter 15).

\(iv\) They can destroy houses with fire, as happened to the entire town of Sciltochium in Swabia which was reduced to ashes by a wise-woman \[saga\] in 1533.

\(v\) They can harm someone\'s reputation in many ways, primarily by the use of conjuring-tricks they have learned from evil spirits and by deluding the senses. An example is the well-known Triscalinus from Le Mans who pretended that a parish priest was carrying a pack of playing-cards under his arm instead of his breviary and even persuaded the priest himself \[that this was so\], and caused him, red with embarrassment, to throw the book away. Such was the evil spirit of Mainz, an extraordinary slanderer, about whom \[Conrad\] Lycosthenes writes in his Extraordinary Events under the year 858, and another evil spirit who acknowledged that a monk in Santarém in Portugal was a saint. (See further below, Book 6, chapter 2, question 3, section 3).

They could also, as \[Bernardo\] da Como maintains at the end of number 13 in his Inquisitors\' Lantern, pass themselves off as innocent people by assuming their appearance during their meetings, if God did not prevent them from doing so. \[Bernardo\'s\] saying that God has allowed this hitherto in the crime of magic, in which a pact with an evil spirit has taken place, is something I have not read or heard of before, and because of this pact and the conspiracy in which they are in league, it is usually possible to reveal wise-women \[sagas\] even when they are not in one\'s presence, as Pierre Le Loyer has said correctly, arguing against \[Andrea\] Alciato in Book 2, chapter 5 of his Spectres. In fact, all wise-women \[sagae\] confess that those who have no experience of this crime or inimical pact cannot make an appearance at their meetings, as the suffragan Bishop of Trier, Peter Binsfeld, tells us with \[the help of\] many instances and an extraordinary learning which deserves our belief no less than does his merit. It is also quite obvious that this is related to God\'s foresight, with the result that \[the witches\'\] treacherous lack of faith cannot do any such thing to innocent people. But if God does allow something like this for a short time, He soon rips apart the evil spirit\'s crafty tricks as though they were spiders\' webs and guards an innocence which is in good order and carefully hidden-something I read in connection with St Silvanus, Bishop of Nazareth, and St Kunegunda, (this I read in \[Albert\] Kranz), who was slandered by an evil spirit with behaving licentiously. There is also the well-known story about a large number of evil spirits who were celebrating a feast at night and, even though they were deceiving demons, lied that they had come from a neighbouring lodging-house. St Germanus disclosed the deception.
[Page 48]

God may be more ready to permit them to take on the appearances of magicians and of those who have sometimes been ensnared by this crime, but it should not be denied that an evil spirit can fully adopt the appearances of innocent people if God allows \[him to do so\], although when and if He does allow it, He soon either uncovers the deception, as I have said, or allows it either \[as a contribution\] towards the remission of other sins \[the innocents have committed\], or for their greater merit and glory in enduring \[the experience\]. (See Bartolomeo della Spina, Investigation into Night-Flying Witches, chapter 14 and \[Three\] Defences \[against Giovanni Ponzinibio\], Book 3, chapter 3). Finally, they can harm a reputation by putting the tools for working harmful magic in certain places where they innocents they want to malign may be thought to have concealed them, which means the innocents are taken to be workers of harmful magic. I find that Mammon, an evil spirit who laid siege to the virgin St Eustochia of Padua, did this. God allowed her to be possessed this way for the whole of her life so that she could gain greater grace and glory, and when she was dead the name \'Jesus\' was found written in indelible writing on her little body. (Read Bernardino Scardoneo, The Antiquities of Padua, Book 2, class 6, folio 121). \[Magicians\] can likewise harm a reputation by revealing hidden sins, as demoniacs usually do, or by making a false accusation, as someone did in Germany during the reign of Emperor Louis II, (a story told by Sigebert \[of Gembloux\] and Vincent de Beauvais); and another evil spirit made a false accusation against \[St\] Dorotheus in relation to the same crime, as \[Simeon\] Metaphrastes tells us in \[Laurent\] Sauer, \'January\'

\(vi\) They can cause banquets or imaginary things to appear as, I think, did the Egyptians Celsus talks about according to Origen, the Brahmins according to Philostratus, and Pasetes according to Suidas, and some years ago \[Girolamo\] Scoto from Parma used to cause \[banquets\] to appear, but those who dined there, while seeming to be fully satisfied in Scoto\'s eyes, were tortured not long afterwards by genuine hunger.¹⁴⁴ Then there is real food. When an evil spirit offers this to witches \[sagis\], for the most part it consists of carrion which tastes bad and smells terrible. Undoubtedly God in His wisdom rarely allows \[an evil spirit\] to put pleasant food in front of them so that this does not afford gluttons the opportunity to fill themselves up with it. For the most part there is no salt, and often no bread either-perhaps so that the evil spirit can organise revels which are the opposite of God\'s Eucharist? In the Old Testament, loaves of shew-bread were placed before God every day, and every sacrificial victim and oblation was sprinkled with salt. Now, too, salt is mingled with \[the water of\] baptism, and in the Eucharist we feed upon the living flesh of Christ the Lord veiled under the appearance or accidentals of bread. So, could this be the reason for \[evil spirits\'\] hatred of bread and salt? I have no doubt that if God allows and wishes, \[an evil spirit\] can put salt and bread and very well-seasoned food in front of \[witches\]. But he rarely does this, and not infrequently he orders those he has invited to wear a badge and to bring along anyone who is willing to eat with them. This is something witches \[sagae\] have often confessed to their judges.

\(vii\) When God permits, \[magicians\] can snatch prisoners away from their prisons and bonds-only local motion and breaking and entering are needed for this; and since human beings can do this, why not an evil spirit, too? \[Johannes\] Trithemius tells a story about Leopold, Duke of Austria, which is worth repeating. \'In 1533 Frederick, Duke of Austria, who had been elected Emperor instead of Ludwig of Bavaria, was beaten in a great battle between Ettingen and Moludorfum and handed over to Ludwig who sent him to a wellfortified tower to be kept under guard. Meanwhile, in Austria, a magician \[magus\] promised \[Frederick\'s\] brother Leopold that, if he were paid well, he would bring Frederick safely \[out of the tower\] within one hour by means of magic. The Duke made generous promises, and so an evil spirit was commissioned and flew to Bavaria. He assumed the appearance of a foreigner and came to the prison.
[Page 49]

\'If you want to be set free from captivity\', he said, \'mount this horse and I\'ll take you safe and sound to your brother Leopold in Austria\'.

\'Who are you?\' asked the Duke.

\'Don\'t ask me who I am\', replied the evil spirit, \'because that is beside the point. Just mount the horse I am showing you\'.

At this point the Duke, who was in other circumstances a very courageous man, was seized with dread and protected himself with the sign of the cross. The spirit \[spiritus\], along with his black horse, disappeared and returned emptyhanded to the \[magician\] who had sent him. The magician loudly rebuked him for not bringing back the prisoner, and the spirit gave him an account of what had happened.

Philostratus writes that Apollonius \[of Tyana\] had escaped from his imprisonment, and the prayers of the Romans\' Vestal Virgins were believed to halt runaway slaves who had not yet left the city.

\(viii\) I am in no doubt that, with the permission of God, who is the God of Sabaoth and grants victory to anyone He pleases, \[magicians\] are able \[to perform\] the art of magic through evil spirits, conjuring-tricks, and various activities whereby, (as though by their own authority), they exercise more power over the rest of humanity; and there is no lack of examples that they can free cities from siege, (as I proved earlier in question 11 with the example of Marcos), and be the cause of victory in battles; and nor is this at odds with reason, because it is not uncommon for praise to be awarded to people in accordance with what their victory deserves. Among the Swedes, Ullr, famous for his exploits in arms, escaped by magic to such an extent that \[public\] opinion credited him with being divine; and Saxo Grammaticus writes about Oddo, a Danish pirate, as follows. \'He roamed the sea without a boat and often drove away enemy vessels by raising storms with a \[magical\] incantation. He was a danger to traders, but merciful to peasants. Having started a fight with Normans, he dulled his enemies\' sight with the power of his incantations in such a way that they began to think that flashing rays afar off were the Danes\' drawn swords, and so when it came to hand to hand combat they could not even look at a sword drawn from its scabbard, the consequence being that their battle-line was defeated because it was incapable of bearing a flashing light which had been produced by a conjuring-trick. Olaus \[Magnus\] says similar things about the Biarmenses \[early Finns\], Saxo about Haakon of Norway, and \[Johannes\] Cuspinian about the Bulgars who defeated Anastasius.

\[Martin\] Cromer says this about a memorable victory of the Tartars over the Poles. \'In 1240AD the Poles were fighting with the Tartars and were beginning to drive them forcibly in the direction of Legnica and press hard on the fugitives. In the Tartars\' rear-guard there was, among other banners, a prominent flag with the letter X on its leading side. On the pointed end \[of its pole\], however, was the dreadful black figure of a bearded head. When the flag-bearer shook this flag with a degree of force, the head would breathe out smoke and a very dense, most disgusting vapour. This vapour would not only stop the Poles from seeing the barbarians but would also kill them with its utterly loathsome smell. The Tartars had made this happen by means of certain incantations which they use in their soothsayings and the rest of their divinations, (just as they do on other occasions, and especially in war), and they are also accustomed to guess the course of future events from human entrails. When the barbarians sensed that the Poles were in disarray, they encouraged each other, made an assault on \[the enemy\], threw their ranks into confusion, and caused great slaughter. The number of Christians killed in this battle was so great that the single ears the Tartars cut off. filled nine enormous sacks.\'
[Page 50]

In the third Book of his history of \[the Kingdom of\] Bohemia, \[Jan\] Dubravius writes that in a battle in which Siderius was the victor, a wise-woman \[saga\] \[made sure\] that all the Luczani could neither go further forward nor retreat, and she fixed each man in his place by casting on him a marvellous numbness so that he could not run away. The Chinese worship Noema, a virgin, for her sanctity. \[Juan\] González de Mendoza writes about her in Book 2, chapter 2 of his history of China. \[He says\] she had acquired the worship because of her practice of magic. When, by order of the King, a war-leader called Compus was leading his fleet towards an island, he could not pull up anchor, however hard he tried, so that he could sail away. At last, he noticed Noema sitting, quite unexpectedly, on his ship\'s figurehead. He approached her, full of reverence, and begged her for help and advice. She replied that unless she guided them, they would not be victorious over the Chinese, and so he set sail with her and hemmed in the enemy who were putting their trust in rather powerful conjuring-tricks. They poured oil on the sea and wrapped everything around in pretended flames, as though to destroy the fleet with fire. Noema put them out and dispelled similar stunts by the enemy with her more efficacious magic, the result being that when they saw that their attempts were unsuccessful, they acknowledged they were beaten and surrendered to Compus. (Mendoza adds several other things, too.)

Whenever wretched peoples\' sins demand them, God certainly permits \[the use of\] the very ancient military conjuring-tricks of magic, because we read in the proverb-writer Diogenianus, that the Ephesians had certain little marks and words of magical power which they used to obtain victory in every fight. Suidas also testifies that a man from Miletus was taking part in a wrestling match with a man from Ephesus during the Olympics and was unable to win his bout because the Ephesian had \'Ephesian marks\' \[attached\] to his ankle, and it was noticed that as soon as these were removed by the referees the Ephesian, who had already exhausted thirty \[competitors\], was defeated. Polyaenus, too, tells us that Chrysame, a woman who used poisonous magic \[venefica\] procured a victory for Cnopus over the Erythraeans by means of her magic and drove the enemy mad, not with an incantation, but with poisoned pieces of bull\'s flesh, \[Strategems 8.43\]. In Book 4, chapter 28 of his History \[of the Franks\], Gregory of Tours records that a Frankish army under King Sigebert was overwhelmed by the Huns because apparitions were cast in its path by an incantation.

For the most part, however, God does not allow a victory \[to depend\] on the power of an evil spirit, and in this case, too, the Old Fox often prefers to deceive his followers. Magentius, of course, thus filled with worthless hope, resigned himself to being conquered by the Emperor Constantius, and King Eric of Sweden, who cultivated this kind of vanity to the highest degree, could not escape Ostanes\'s hands, even after so many victories. In the same history of Sweden, we read that Hadding, who was taking his orders from an evil spirit called Odhinn, clashed with the Curetes in battle and was overwhelmed. \[Odhinn\] had given him strength with a \[magic\] potion, but Hadding could not be victorious as long as he was following the plan for an army which was going to be drawn up for battle by an old man. Evil spirits full of deception laid him open to very many different misfortunes in his wars, at one time proclaiming him victorious, at another depriving him of all help and so, overcome this way by the magnitude of his despair, he decided to hang himself in front of his people.
[Page 51]

Next \[example\]: among the other causes of the great massacre of Flemings by the French in 1302, \[Jacob de\] Meyer in Book 10 of his chronicles records that the commander of the Flemish army, Willem van Gulik, personally employed diviners and necromancers \[sortilegos et necromanticos\], and conjured and consulted evil spirits. (\[Robert\] Gaguin and other French historians ascribe the same reason for the defeat and captivity of Ferdinand of Portugal, the Count of Flanders through his wife-\[namely\] the witchcraft \[sortilegium\] of his mother. The Flemings are silent on the subject). In connection with the year 1304, Jacob de Meyer also says this of the Willem I mentioned. \'Gossip has it that he was deceived by a necromancer from whom he had learned a \[magical\] technique which he promised would render him invisible whenever he wanted during danger, however great \[the danger might be\]. But the spell did him no good at all when it came to saving his life\'. It was exceedingly useful \[in bringing him\] to the torment of a real, eternal death!

The people of Pergamum once tried to free themselves from a siege by using magic, but their attempt came to nothing and their effort was wasted, as Paul the Deacon tells us in Book 20 of his history of Rome; and during the reign of Leo the Isaurian, Masalmas \[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik\], the leader of the Saracens, seized Pergamum without any difficulty even though the citizens, who were relying on a certain magician, had made an appalling sacrifice to the Devil by cutting open a pregnant woman, removing the child alive, and boiling it in a cooking-pot while all the soldiers polluted the right-hand sleeve \[of their tunics\] with this wicked sacrifice. (For which, see Theophanes.)

I remember another noteworthy example of a \[magical\] stunt in connection with this topic, too. Bretislav, Duke of the Luczani-this is what Aeneas Silvius says-\'the founder of Bratislava, had started a war with his own nephew, Gremozislaus, Duke of Bohemia. The story is that when her stepson was about to go to war, there was a woman there who predicted that Bretislav would fall in battle and that the greater part of the populace would die with him, but that the young man \[her stepson\] could escape if he did as she told him. The youth replied that he would carry out her instructions, and so she told him he was to kill the first man he met, cut off both his ears, and stow them away in his wallet. Then he was to draw a cross on the ground with his sword between his horse\'s front legs, kiss it, and make a speedy retreat. Battle was joined on a plain called Thuscus, and Bretislav was killed. The young man who had done as his stepmother had told him escaped safely home, but he found that his wife, whom he loved dearly, had been killed. Her ears were missing and her breast had been pierced through. Aghast and unhappy, he realised that the ears of the enemy, which he had cut off, were those of his wife\'.

The price he paid was worthy of the wise-woman \[sagae\] he had consulted about victory. Perhaps his wife was also a practitioner of poisonous magic \[venefica\] and engaged herself in the battle, something the women of Bohemia have a habit of doing, or in this case it was a kind of harmful magic \[maleficii\] done with the help of a fatal image which was displayed during the battle while an evil spirit damaged the unfortunate woman at home. (I shall have to discuss this topic in Book Four.)

In Book 7 of the Annals of Bavaria, we read that the Fridericus Stuphius who falsely called himself Fridericus II and was preparing a war with the help of money \[he had got\] by magic, was overwhelmed, taken prisoner, and burned by Rudolf of Habsburg. So, Pope Innocent acted no less judiciously than he did religiously when he took pains to expel from Rome magicians who had been invited there by pagans from Tuscany on the promise that they would free the city from a siege by Alaric, the same way they boasted they had rescued the town of Larina. Not unlike this was the good sense, (but more severe judicial punishment), in the case of the Count of the Allobroges. This man was a follower of the Duke of Anjou and had charge of the Castel dell\'Ovo, a heavily fortified \[castle\] in Naples, washed on all sides by the sea. The Duke sent for him because he wanted his advice. Should a certain person\'s offer be accepted or not? The \'certain person\' was a magician who was boasting that he had surrendered this very fortress into the hands of Charles the Peacemaker who had withdrawn into it at the time, and that he was prepared to hand it over to the Angevins by using the same wily trick. He would create a thick cloud, \[he said\], build a bridge by using conjuring-tricks, and immediately extend it to the top of the fortress\'s walls; and once the defenders had been forced by fear to surrender, the soldiers who were going to come over the bridge would be so much on their guard that they would not be able to make any sign of the cross with their hand, their arms, their legs, or their weapons, and at that moment the bridge would be dispersed like smoke, and those who were crossing over it would die. The Count took note of this and argued that the Duke should send for the magician so that he could give him \[the Count\] more information about the whole business. The wretched man came and repeated his promise to the Count. The Count retorted that he would never commission him to convince such hard-working soldiers and experienced war-leaders that Charles the Peacemaker could not be vanquished without \[recourse to\] forbidden practices and such disgraceful behaviour. He then ordered that the magician be handed over to the public executioner and be beheaded. (These events took place in 1383.)
[Page 52]

\(ix\) There are many would-be persuasive \[exemplary stories\] about the high offices and honours to which someone is promoted by the use of magic. First, people adduce Roman Pontiffs who are recorded by various historians as having ascended to the highest Apostolic office this way-Martin II, of course, Benedict IX, John XXII and John XXIII, Silvester II, and Gregory VII. I reply, however, that in the case of Martin II it is said he came to the Pontificate by means of wicked practices, but it is said by people who hated him. One does not have to understand \'wicked practices\' as referring to magic, either. Bribery is a wicked practice, so is slander, so is simony, and so forth. Silvester II was a first-rate geometrician and wrote a book on the subject, a manuscript \[copy\] of which, as everyone knows, is held in the Farnese library.

He was also an expert in natural philosophy during a time which was so ignorant that natural philosophers and geometricians were considered to be magicians, and in consequence of this commonly held delusion many a fairy-tale was told about him, spread without heed by Martin, a Cistercian, and Calfridus. There are also widespread stories about both Johns and Benedict and Gregory, and there can be no doubt at all that these were disseminated to please the schismatic Emperors of the time. Cardinal Benno, who was a sworn enemy of Gregory during his lifetime, crammed his book with so many and such shameless lies that he seems either to have wanted to paint the picture of a Pontiff who was very wicked because of his character, just as Xenophon \[painted a picture\] of a very good King in his book on Cyrus: or the book was written, with Benno\'s name attached to it, by some heretic or other within our fathers\' lifetime.

Certainly, writers who lived in Gregory\'s day openly spoke against him, as Onofrio \[Panvinio\] and \[Roberto\] Bellarmino tell us. Nor can I believe that God will ever allow the Apostolic See to be defiled by an occupant who practises magic. Secondly, they adduce certain other examples such as that of Theophilus, the man who recovered the high office of Vidame with the help of an evil spirit, and similar \[stories\]. But one should not be surprised that magic can do what bribery, simony, and other corrupt practices can do because when God gives His permission, magic is successful; and when He does give His permission, He usually elicits thereby either timely punishment of the offenders, or an increase in reverence for God, or some other good.

The Devil himself, however, for the most part deceives magicians and dispenses to those with the empty hope of high office or princely dominion, (who should be burned), a straw instead of a sceptre and a funeral pyre instead of a crown. (The Annals of Bavaria tell us about Stuphius; \[Enguerrand de\] Monstrelet about the Breton Baron \[Gilles\] de Rais in Book 2, chapter 248 of his Histories, and Meyer-at length-about the Duc d\' Orléans in Book 13.) Furthermore, the story told by the author of the trashy Arbatel is ridiculous. \[He says\] that a Jewish magician used magic to cause the last King of Italy to be thrown out of the kingdom of Naples and \[to make sure that no Italian can ever rule over it, and that there is no remedy \[for this\] unless that magician is evoked by another, more powerful \[magician\] and forced to undo what he did. (This is what that complete liar, the author writes in aphorism 35). Nothing can be more inane and stupid than that, and I have mentioned it only so that the worthlessness of magicians may be apparent to everyone.

\(x\) One comes to the same conclusion in regard to genuine riches and treasures as one does in regard to high office-that an evil spirit can \[grant them\] if God is willing to let him do so, although He does not usually give His permission except in very rare circumstances for a variety of reasons. When Psellus writes, \'The Devil provides his worshippers with absolutely none of the things he promises he can undertake to do, only things which are useless to look at\', if he is talking about what the Devil usually does, what he writes is true; but if he is talking about what the Devil can do, it is not true. The same goes for what has been recorded by a well-known man¹⁶¹-that an evil spirit cannot, with God\'s permission, (because this is taken for granted), produce any of the genuine, real material \[from which one makes\] money, or give it a real form.
[Page 53]

One has to make this distinction because, although the \'form\' of money is the inscription on the coin, and this inscription requires craftsmanship, one can be in no doubt at all that the Devil is able to stamp out any kind of gold and silver coins he wants. He can also produce material to make a coin-that is, an object consisting of a metal compound-by applying active things to passive by way of a natural and artificial production-after all, he can produce living insects and these are more perfect than any metal-but this production must not be called \'creation\'. The Devil cannot produce the material for coinage by genuinely creating it because genuine creation involves producing money out of nothing, and this is a work proper only to Almighty God.

Consequently, theologians are united against Platonists, Simonians, and Avicenna in saying that God could not create the world by using angels to be a kind of natural cause, achieving their end independently, the way the causes of things in Nature usually do, because it seems to me very much more likely that what God does by using instrumental effective causes among \[a number\] of symbolic causes which make something happen, (just as the dead will be raised at the sound of the angel\'s trumpet at the Last Judgement), He can do by using angels. Consequently, God could, with His untrammelled power, allow the Devil to do or say anything, and create gold from the start. But in fact, under those circumstances, the principal efficient cause would be God\'s permission and will, independently making this happen through the medium of a natural cause, and the Devil would merely be the symbolic instrument of this creation.

If you consider this carefully, I do not think it can be denied. If you object to the way I have said it, I do not want to engage in a war of words. The proof of what I have said is that an evil spirit knows the hiding-place of every treasure, where riches have been submersed in the sea, \[the location of\] gold and silver mines, and where pearls and gemstones are hidden. So, he could take what he wanted without anyone\'s being able or daring to resist him. He can also remove coins from someone\'s purse or pocket much more cunningly and secretively than any mortal, and so although petty thieves and cutpurses often do this, he will certainly have the ability \[to do it\] as well. Various \[writers\'\] exemplary stories confirm this. Damhouder, in fact, while discussing money in a disparaging way, gives four examples which you will be able to read in that discussion, and Stuphius, (whom I have mentioned), paid an army with money \[he obtained\] by magic. Nevertheless, I add that the Devil can indeed enrich his followers if God were to permit it and \[the Devil\] wanted to do so; and the same applies if God were to order \[him to do so\] and he did not want to do it, (because he would be forced unwillingly to obey God). But the evil spirit does not want to do this, except on rare occasions, and God never orders it, and so He very rarely gives His permission.

It is clear \[the Devil\] is unwilling, because we see that he frequently makes a fool of his followers, and although he sometimes bestows a little real money on a few of them, as he did on Dr Vlät in Triers, for the most part, however, he deceives them with worthless hope and the \[deceptive\] appearance \[of money\]. \[Nicholas\] Rémy confirms this in Book 1, chapter 4 of his Worship of Evil Spirits, with many examples from his personal experience \[as a judge\]. He says, \'In Dieuze on 30th September 1586, Sennel from Armentières received money-so she imagined-from an evil spirit and, in transports of delight, went home quickly to count it, but when she shook out her purse, she found nothing except bits of tile and pieces of charcoal. In Dieuze on 4th November 1586, Catharine from Metz found pig shit. Claudia Morèle in Serre, on 3rd December 1586: Benoît Drigie in Haraucourt, on 15th December 1585: Dominique Pétrone in Pagnysur-Moselle, on 20th October 1586, and very many others \[found\] tree leaves. In Masevaux, on 5th June, 1585, Jeanne le Ban found a gold coin wrapped in paper on the road, just as an evil spirit had predicted she would, and when she eagerly showed it to her husband she noticed, (not without embarrassment), that she had stumbled across a dark red pebble and not a gold coin after all; and what is more, at the very first touch it began to break up into little pieces. Catharina Ruffa from the Vallée de la Moselle, on 28th July 1586, was the only one to acknowledge she had once received three coins without being deceived by the \[evil spirit\]\'. All these examples were taken from judicial records by the judge himself, and I am happy to make use of them because they are vouched for by the public credibility of the notaries who were present at the trials.
[Page 54]

Rumour has it that when the magicians Faustus and Agrippa were on a journey, \[once they arrived at\] their lodging-houses they were in the habit of counting out coins which were real to look at, but after only one or two days those who had received them would find they were bits of horn or absolutely worthless scraps of rag. \[An evil spirit\] had given an unfortunate, but well-born, married woman from Moselle, who was handed over to the flames at the confluence of the waters a few years ago because of the crime of sorcery \[crimen sortiarium \] a basket filled with what looked like scudi. She put them in a money box, but when she wanted to make use of them, she found horse shit in place of the coins. Several other \[stories\] of this kind are told because \[the evil spirit\] takes pleasure in deception and in provoking human beings to anger. Lorenzo d\'Anania gives another explanation, (why is he unwilling to accept this one?)-that evil spirits \[malos genios\] have dedicated themselves to covetousness and to guarding \[hidden\] treasures and money for the Antichrist, the son of perdition, so that he has enough for his expenses, and that this is what an evil spirit \[daemonem\] said in answer to a certain soothsayer \[ariolo\], although one should not believe an evil spirit at all, since he is a liar. But what he says is somewhat inconsistent with the truth.

The more reliable explanation is that God never orders this, (because He does not co-operate with evil), and rarely permits it. Why otherwise should we see that there is nothing more base, more beggarly, more unprincipled, and more hateful than the kind of human being to whom an evil spirit makes such glittering promises of riches, high office, and the favour of princes? If they were rich before, he beggars them. If they are beggars, they never become rich. Lucian says that Apollonius used magic to look for treasure, but neither Lucian nor Philostratus testify he ever found anything from which \'he would bring back a more perfumed head. This is also relevant to God\'s providence and His righteous governance of the world and the Church militant. His \[providence\] is absolutely clear and for that reason one might infer a distinction: how many people could be drawn to their death by genuine riches when countless numbers are drawn by those which are spurious? If the Devil could make anyone he wanted rich at his own pleasure-and almost all mortals have a wicked hunger for gold-one would have to be very afraid that he would drive almost all humans to devil-worship, especially those who have strayed from the true Faith. For this reason, the Devil would supply irreligious people with money, the sinew of war, and in consequence he would easily crush the devout unless God came to their aid with a fresh miracle.

Quite rightly, therefore, God has reserved to Himself the power and decision to make human beings rich. God gives everything but does not have less as a result. The earth is the Lord\'s, and its fullness\'. \'He opens His hand and fills every living thing with His blessing\'. \'He gives to each and offers no reproach\'. \'In His left hand are riches and glory\'. He enriches wicked people so that they may acknowledge His goodness and be converted, or at least so that He may in some fashion reward their good deeds. (This is well-known in the case of Cyrus and Nebuchadnezzar). He also enriches the good so that they may use \[their wealth\] properly and spend it on works of mercy.

The Devil, for his part, does not have anything to give and, in fact, pursues evil-doers with a proverbial hatred, flattering them merely to deceive them and bring them to everlasting torments; and to achieve this the more quickly, he not infrequently betrays his comrades-in-arms and hands them over to a judge as if to an armed force because he takes pleasure in the miseries, ruin, and death of human beings (whom he hates because \[they have been made in\] the image of God). Hence it happens that we see that he dupes humans with the empty hope of finding treasures and persuades them to look \[for them\] even though human laws tell them not to do so. Then he either makes them faint from fear or cruelly suffocates them. André Thevet relates a story he heard from an eye-witness about a Greek chappie called Macrianus who was swallowed by the earth while he was looking for treasure on the island of Paros, \[George\] Kedrenos says something similar in \[his account of the Emperor\] Anastasius, and several other people \[tell\] other stories. I shall record one which is not unworthy of one\'s astonishment.
[Page 55]

\'In about 1520 in Basel, a simple-minded tailor with a stammer entered, (exactly how is not clear), the tunnel by which one can get into Augusta Raurica and, having gone further than anyone else had managed, he brought back a report of a number of extraordinary things he had seen. He lit a consecrated candle and went down into the tunnel. First, (he used to say), he had gone through an iron gate. Then he came out of one vault into another, and then into gardens which were in full, very beautiful bloom. In the middle he observed a hall, very richly decorated, and a young woman, very beautiful down to her private parts. Her head was circled with a golden crown, her hair was loose, and her lower half ended in \[the form of a frightening snake. She took him by the hand and led him to an iron chest. Two black hounds were lying on it and when they approached, \[the dogs\] set up a dreadful barking, but the young woman, with a menacing air, restrained them. Then she removed a bunch of keys she was in the habit of wearing tied round her neck, opened the chest, and brought out all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze coins, and he used to tell people that, as a result of the young woman\'s generosity, he had brought back not a few of these \[coins\] out of the tunnel itself.

He added that the young woman told him more than once, with dreadful imprecations, that when she was born, she was already cursed by her royal descent, and had been changed into the kind of monster \[he saw before him\], and that she had no good reason to think she would recover her wholesomeness. But if she were kissed three times by a young man of undiminished propriety, her original form would be restored to her and the whole treasure which was lying hidden in that spot would be made over to her liberator as a dowry. He claimed he had indeed kissed the young woman twice, \[but\] that twice he observed her making such dreadful gestures in anticipation of her liberation that he was afraid she would tear him to pieces while he was still alive. Some of his grandchildren brought him to the theatre, but afterwards he could never find the entrance to the tunnel, let alone go into it\'.

Who does not detect \[that this was\] an illusion? The young man was not entirely compos mentis, to say the least. That evil spirit, which belonged to the genus \'vampire\' \[lamiarum\], was asking for a kiss. She would have devoured him after the third one, but God did not permit it. The two dogs were other evil spirits, either genuine or fictitious guardians of the treasure. Some of the coins may have been real and, with God\'s permission, were given \[to him\]. After a few years another citizen from Basel went into the same tunnel with the intention of relieving his family\'s poverty but found nothing except the bones of human corpses. Seized by a sudden dread, he made a rapid exit and was affected by fits of madness until he died a wretched death on the third day afterwards.

A few years ago, a prior from \[the abbey\] of Margoulline, along with two companions, went into a pit in the cave of King Sala near Puteoli in search of treasure, but died a wretched death and was not seen again, as \[Jacques de\] Villamont tells us in Book 1, chapter 23 of his Voyages;¹ and in his Inquiry into Evil Spirits, chapter 12, Andrea Cesalpino confirms these points when he writes as follows. \'I am certainly aware of many treasure hunters\', he says, \'because of their great skills, but I don\'t know any who have been successful in finding anything. In Pisa, during my lifetime, some of them tried to dig, but stopped because they were defeated by the difficulty of what they had undertaken. Finally, after a year, they started to dig in a spot where places built by Nero were said to have existed-the place is now occupied by a convent-and where there was an enormous pine tree. But they were so plagued by evil spirits that they were forced to give up the moment they began because they were afraid. (During this time, many of the sisters living there were obsessed by an evil spirit)\'. What is surprising about this if they had allowed an illicit search for treasure to take place on their own soil? God inflicted a punishment on them in this world to spare them one in another life. No one, in my opinion, has discussed this subject more intelligently or more accurately than Paolo Grillando in question 3, number 12 of his book on divinatory magicians. Consequently, I think it a good idea to transcribe his words for you.
[Page 56]

\'They boast that by using this kind of \[magical\] practice they can find treasure which has been hidden away in very remote places underground, and there comes a time when they bring people to such a point of insanity that they dig pits as large as they can manage in order to find this kind of treasure. It seems to me that this is one of the more shameful illusions an evil spirit can cause a human being because the truth of the matter is that I have never read, seen, or heard that any necromancer, worker of magic, or diviner \[sortilegis\] of this sort has ever found treasure, or gold or silver anywhere else. But how often have I seen that those who devote themselves to this task and make extraordinary exertions to put it to the test finally, after a great deal of hard work and worshipping of the Devil, have seen and found nothing except earth! The reason is that God neither permits nor wishes an evil spirit to be able to lay up treasure, because otherwise the result would be that these workers of magic, necromancers, and all the other professors of faith in the Devil would be richer and more distinguished than the Christian faithful; and one would find very many from among the faithful of Christ who would follow them with the intention of becoming rich, and would not care about turning their backs on the Christian faith itself in order to acquire a great abundance of treasure and be treated with respect by everyone. But actually these days we see the complete opposite, because these diviners, magicians \[magi\], necromancers, and the like are poorer, more abject, and more base than the rest of Christ\'s faithful and generally lead, (because God permits it), a miserable life in this world, finally coming to an unfortunate end and being tortured in the flames of eternal fire, (as it says in the chapter \'most strongly\', from \'Concerning heretics\', and the chapter \'it is not surprising\', 26, question 5.) They are also keen to deceive us with the same cunning and similar promises to the ones the evil spirit uses to deceive them. But they take prisoner only some people who have a shallow knowledge of things and lack understanding, or those who are too credulous and inquisitive and, because of a kind of vehement desire, shamelessly seek to know things it is not proper for them to investigate without any reason and for no good purpose. (See the chapter \'it is not surprising\', the paragraph headed \'divinations\' \[auguria\], in the direction of these words, \'of a powerful\'.)

Thus far, Grillando. I find that the Indians of Malindi are in the habit of boasting that they try to draw rewards from the bottom of the sea by means of incantations-with what result I do not know. Read \[Fernão Lopes de\] Castanheda\'s Indian History, Book 1, chapter 30. With God\'s permission, the Devil sometimes produces rewards in order to strengthen his followers in their superstition. Without God\'s permission, he cannot \[do this\] and throws the blame on some mistake made by those performing the incantations. One should also note in connection with this that certain people are said to have found treasures by the use of magic in which they are experts, and by clever guesswork-the Saracen, for example, in the time of Guiscard the Norman in Apulia, whose magical deed \[is described\] by \[Bartolomeo\] Platina and \[Pandolfo\] Collenuccio. But Petrarch ascribes it more to practical good sense, and as far as this is concerned one will refer to the maxim that everyone can weigh up the subject on a scale which is balanced true.

Let me close this chapter with the most powerful and most devout Emperor, Charles v, who made an excellent decision when he ordered Cornelius Agrippa and two other noblemen into exile from the court and his realms because they had offered people the hope of \[finding\] treasure with the help of magic. May you and your crown be fortunate, Charles. You already enjoy felicity. May your posterity live long and be victorious, as long as they protect the Catholic \[faith\] and shrink from doing anything irreligious and meddlesome. If they fall into doing that kind of thing, they will be unlike you in virtue, just as they are in good fortune.

Book 2, Question 13

Do magicians have the power to cast a spell on brute creatures?

In the case of snakes, not only poets but also Christians have believed this. I commended poets earlier in Question 9, especially Vergil, Ovid, and Nemesianus. To these let me now add Lucilius, Satires 20:

\'As a Marsian bursts snakes apart with his chanting, After he has made their veins swell;

Horace, Epodes \[17.29\]:

\'My head is distracted by a Marsian incantation\';

Ovid, Medicines for a Woman\'s Face \[39\]:

\'Snakes are not split in two by Marsian incantations\';

In \[Aeneid\] Book 7, Vergil says they fell asleep because of an incantation, \[vv.757-758\], and likewise Publius Silius Italicus:

\'Athyr was skilled in disarming snakes of their deadly poison, And sending water-snakes to sleep at his touch\', \[Punica 1.411-412\];

and Seneca, who describes Medea at some length in Act 4, \[vv.680-690\]:

\'With her left hand she makes supplication at the gloomy shrine, And summons all the deadly diseases brought forth by burning Libya\'s sand, And all those the Taurus confines with its perpetual snow, numbing them with its northern cold, And every \[kind of monster. Dragged out by her magic incantations, A scaly throng leaves its hiding-places and makes an appearance. Here a fierce snake drags its endless body, Flicks out its three-forked tongue, and casts about for those to whom It can come, bringing death. At the sound of her chanting, it is mesmerised. Its body swells, gathers itself together in knotted folds, And forces itself into coils.\'

Manilius, \[Astronomica\] Book 5. \[vv.391-393\]:

\'\[Ophiuchus\] makes the bodily parts of snakes harmless to those born \[under him\]. They will receive \[snakes\] in the folds \[of their garments\] and in their flowing robe, And will safely plant kisses on the dreadful poisonous creatures.\'

One has to read \'sinibusque\' \[folds\] in these verses-it is written correctly in the Gembloux manuscript-just as the ancients wrote \'Vergil\' and \'Virgil\', so also they wrote \'senus\' and \'sinus\'. It\'s the same in Manilius, isn\'t it? \'\[A dolphin\] derives energy from the sinuous ways in which it moves \[sinibus\] and imitates the curling billow\', \[5.421\].

Critics will have remarked why these corruptions happen, so I return to my starting point. \[Manilius\] later confirms at greater length what I have said when he deals with those born under the sign of the Bear, and this confirms what I have read in the annual letters from my Jesuit brethren in Peru, dated 1590. In this collection, \[Gaspare\] Spitilli tells us about a harmless contact with a viper, \[something\] devised by an evil spirit during stunts put on by Indian magicians, perhaps to make light of St Paul\'s miracle.

\'They also celebrate another festival no less superstitious than the one I mentioned earlier. In a small room they shut up a boy who has a beautiful face and is considered by the whole stronghold to be very good-looking, and order him to fast until his hair has grown long. Then magical conjurors, along with the elders, fetch him out and bring him to the house of one of his friends who has, for example, a very close connection with him. In the house, elderly women weep plaintively over the boy, and the common folk who are assembled and come together while this is happening, gradually cut off the boy\'s hair, starting at the front. Each person is offered a cooked goose. On the next day the magician dispatches \[some\] of the younger men to hunt wild animals, deputes others to make ready a suitable feast, orders girls to boil up some good wine and older folk to assemble musical instruments. From that moment, they start to play them, and from then on, those whom the magician sent away on his errands are free to pillage whatever they find out with anyone\'s house. They invite the neighbouring tribes to come to the feast wearing a variety of weapons.
[Page 58]

The boy, who has been garlanded at the time of the feast, has an offensive weapon in one hand and a living viper hanging from the other. He sits in a chair which has been placed in splendidly decorated spot, and it is easy to deduce from what I have said that an evil spirit is at work, because the viper does not bite him. Several other dead vipers, too, are tied to the boy\'s body. These were caught by the young men when they went hunting and are placed on one side of the boy along with boiled and roasted geese. His other side is hemmed in by a large amount of wine. After this, soldiers invited to the feast come in according to their military rank and distinction, make a reverence to the viper, go up to the boy, drink the wine next to him, and take the food which has been prepared and placed next to the boy. Then they retrace their steps, make a reverence to the viper again, and ask for a second helping of food and drink. They spend three whole days in this fashion, after which they kill the viper. Then the women, (who have been shut up indoors for the whole period of the festival), come out shouting, \"Victory!\" During this kind of celebration an evil spirit frequently appears, urging \[people\] to drink, eat, and spend the festal days in cheerfulness and merriment. \'

Pedro Cieza, too, writes that all the huge snakes of the Andes mountains have laid aside all their ferocity and power to harm because they were once disarmed by the incantations of an elderly woman, and are now harmless and terrify only because of their appearance. Alvise Cadamosto also confirms the same thing in his history of sea-voyages to the Indies, because \[he says\] that this power is attributed to the Negro peoples of Africa. However it started, Christian Fathers-St Jerome, St Basil, St Augustine, Arnobius, Theodoret, Alcimus, Bede, and Euthymius-think it is indicated in passages of Holy Scripture, since they take these at face value and acknowledge what the ancients recorded about the Marsi as likely to be true. I do not think St Hilarius disagrees because he understands \[passages\] about the evil spirit allegorically \[while\] the other Fathers take them in the literal sense. He thinks \[what the ancients say\] about the Marsi is a fairy-story in as far as the common people used to think that these things happened because of the power of the incantation.

The rest \[of the Fathers\] understand them in the sense Hilarius denies and I retain-that is, that an evil spirit \[malum genium\] flies towards the \[sound of the\] incantation as though it were a signal, and either disarms the snakes, or puts them to sleep, or kills them. The well-known example of the magician from Salzburg makes this point. When he was trying to force all the snakes-and this means one thousand of them!-into a furnace, he was finally killed by one huge old \[snake\] which struck out at him. An evil spirit, of course, had driven the rest of them into the furnace, but was unwilling to compel this one, preferring to rouse it against the magician. After all, if the rest of them had been driven into the furnace by the power of an incantation, that same power would have extended to this snake as well. This is clear from the ridiculous and tasteless form of words magicians use, and if other people had not spread it all over the place by writing it down, they would have done better to reflect on \[the story\] and ask some intelligent questions.

There are two passages of Scripture. In David we read, \'\[Their madness is\] like that of a viper which is deaf and stops up its ears: which will not listen to the voice of those who are chanting and of the worker of poisonous magic \[venefici\] who is chanting discreetly,\' \[Psalm 57.5&6, Vulgate\]. Natural instinct, therefore, tells it that power can be brought to bear against it by means of an incantation. (Euthymius records that this kind of snake is called a \'Palamnis\'). In Jeremiah \[we read\], \'I shall send venomous snakes for which no incantation exists\', \[8.17\], that is, which cannot be enchanted. All the rest, therefore, can \[be enchanted\] although-let me not pretend otherwise-the sense can be that snakes will be so deadly that their bites cannot be cured. The Septuagint confirms this interpretation when it translates \[this as\], \'death-bringing snakes, for which no incantation exists: and they will bite you in a way for which there is no cure\'.
[Page 59]

The passage from David, then, is a batter one to prove the point and let us understand that magicians have this power over snakes because of the force of their \[demonic\] pact. I have no doubt they can exercise it over every other kind of beast-hence Silius \[Italicus\], \'Kartalo who was not afraid to stroke pregnant lionesses\', \[Punica 1.405\]-and in Book 3, chapter 12 of his Voyages, \[Jacques de\] Villamont tells us that fishermen are accustomed \[to use incantations\] against crocodiles. But I acknowledge St Augustine\'s notion that because of the deception practised on our first parents by the serpent, and because there is a greater intimacy between snakes and evil spirits, (not by Nature but by divine permission), God more frequently permits the enchantment of snakes than of other wild creatures. \[Paolo\] Grillando quite rightly says at the end of Question 8, \'On another occasion, during the time of Hadrian VI, before he arrived in the city as Pontiff, I saw a Greek magician who had a remarkable reputation because with words alone he had restrained the violence of a very ferocious bull which was part of a herd living in a wooded place. He rooted \[the bull\] to the spot like this, as I said, and, having humbled it, got hold of it by the horns and, with a quite fragile piece of rope, (which, however, had been made by magic), tethered it and led it where he wanted, in the middle of the night, for about four or five miles. This was seen by two hundred and more men\'.¹⁷⁵ But Grillando is mistaken when he thinks all this could have been done by the actual power of words, because in Book 1 I have refuted the claim made by the magician he mentions. Arnobius Book 1. \[43, Against the Heathen\], Jerome in his Life of Hilarion \[20\], and Cassiodorus, \[Variae Epistolae\] Book 3, letter 51, tell us that in races in the Circus, people were accustomed to use an incantation to speed up their own horses and slow down those of their opponents.

Suppose someone asks whether evil spirits really can change animals\' colours the way they can change their feelings. I can have no doubts \[about this\] because they know the waters with which this is accomplished naturally. In Book 3, chapter 12 of his Inquiry into Living Things, Aristotle testifies this as follows. \'There exist rivers in many places, and when sheep drink from them and step into them soon afterwards, they give birth to black lambs. In the Assyritis district of the Chalcidice in Thrace, for example, there is a river known as the \"Psychrus\" because of its excessive cold, which does this; and in Antandria there are two rivers, one of which makes flocks white, and the other black. The River Scamander, too, is believed to make sheep yellow which, they say, is why Homer called it the \"Yellow River\". Varro, quoted by Solinus, also recorded that on the coast of the Red Sea there is a spring, and if sheep drink from it the condition of their fleece changes from being white before they drank to a swarthy black \[afterwards\]. Magicians relate more miracles in connection with rivers, and if these really did happen, \[evil spirits\] could \[be doing\] all these things to living creatures by \[using this kind of water. I shall add one or two \[more examples\]. Publius Naso \[Ovid\], Metamorphoses Book 15.

\'In the middle of the day, horned Ammon, Your stream is cold. At dawn and sunset, it is warm. There is a story that the Athamanes set fire to wood which has been soaked by its waters When the moon has withdrawn into her smallest orbits. The Cicones have a river which, if drunk, turn one\'s internal organs to stone And turn the objects it has touched into marble. On your shores, the Crathis and its neighbour the Sybaris Make hair like look like amber and gold; and what is more extraordinary, there are waters Which have the power to change not only bodies, but minds as well. Who has not heard of the ill-omened waters of the Salmacis \[fountain\] And the lakes of Aethiopia? If anyone drinks from their sources, He either becomes mad or sinks into a stupor remarkable for its heaviness. Whoever slakes his thirst from the spring in Clitor Avoids wine and is happy to remain sober with pure water The river in Lyncestis has the opposite effect. Whoever drinks even a moderate amount of this Staggers about, just as though he had been drinking undiluted wine\'.
[Page 60]

Book 2, Question 14

Can \[magicians\] use their craft to produce or bring into existence anything which is of more than one kind, and in particular, things which are capable of sensory perception?

Here is the first proposition. They can quickly produce incomplete living creatures-flies, worms, frogs, and insects of this kind-and other things which are born from putrefaction, not by creating them, but by applying active things to passive. Thus St Augustine, followed by the school of theologians. But magicians usually produce these things because of their pact with an evil spirit which applies active things to passive. For the most part, you see, the magicians themselves do not know it is the pact which is giving rise to these things and are ignorant of what is causing them: for example, when the Devil gives wise-women \[sagis\] a very small amount of fine powder and they throw it into the air, and various kinds of winged and unwinged locusts, mice, caterpillars, and different destructive sorts of similar little creatures come into existence at once. Sometimes \[the Devil\] orders them to tear up the first sprouting shoot they come across in the field they want to devastate, or to knock off a plant from a tree they intend to destroy, and to employ different kinds of wonderful magical whining \[naenias\] which have no natural power. As matters stand, magicians could even produce the kind of somewhat defective geese which are usually born from the fallen fruits of trees, which are rotting in the sea or, of course, from the timbers of decayed ships, which the Scots and the inhabitants of the Hebrides acknowledge does happen. (They call them klakis and bernicles.)

But are the living things to which they give these names things which are fully complete? I think it more likely that they cannot be \[if they happen as a result of\] applying active things to passive, because it is more likely that these things cannot be born from putrefaction. \[That can happen\] only by means of the generative seed of parents, either from the father or from an evil spirit \[acting as\] an incubus who pours it into the mother, as will be discussed later. An evil spirit could also enclose things of this kind, which he had produced already, in the woman\'s womb and then skilfully bring them out by means of some kind of secret route belonging to a hidden passage he knows about. He could also cherish them, feed them, and make them breathe in the remote places where they seem to be born, seeing that flies, mice, and defective things such as that \[are born\] among rocks on which things which are quite often defective are born. I absolutely believe this is what happened in the case of the dogs William of Newburgh spoke about as follows. \'While \[workmen\] were splitting open a huge rock in a particular quarry with their iron tools, two dogs appeared. They filled to capacity the space available to them in that rock which had no hole at all through which they could breathe\', (meaning \"perceptible hole\").

\'They seemed to belong to the breed of dogs known as \"greyhounds\", but they looked ferocious, smelled bad, and had no hair. It is said one of them died not long afterwards, but they say that Henry, Bishop of Winchester, played with the other one, which had a quite extraordinary appetite, for a good many days\', (History of the English, Book 1, chapter 28).

He follows this by saying that a toad was found in another stone with a small gold chain round its neck. I think an evil spirit added the chain and that the toad itself could have been born there, just as enormous flints have been found in cola-mines in Liège, inside which live toads have been formed and were lying hidden as though in their birth-canal.
[Page 61]

Evil spirits can also produce a number of strange monsters, such as the one from Brazil which was seventeen palms\' tall, covered in lizard skin, with swollen breasts, lions\' limbs, and staring, flame-coloured, glittering eyes, and a similarly coloured tongue, (something like the monsters with half-human faces which were captured in the forests of Saxony in 1240). It may be possible that these were born from an abominable coitus between human beings and wild animals, which is undoubtedly the origin of most monsters. This is why Alcippe gave birth to an elephant at the time of the Marsic War \[91-88 This is why a Swiss woman bore a lion in 1278. This is why a woman produced a cat in Pavia in 1470, and another woman a dog in Brescia. This is why, in 1531, a woman in Augsburg in one and the same birth first produced a human head wrapped in its membranes, then a snake with two feet, and thirdly an entire pig. (One can read other things of this kind in more recent authors, too.)

One \[story\] which caps the rest, extraordinary though they may be, is the one reported by Castanheda in his Annals of Portugal. Because of a crime \[she had committed\], a woman was taken away by ship to an uninhabited island, and when she had been put ashore there a troop of monkeys, in which the place abounded, stood round her, growling. Then one who was rather big, to whom the rest of them gave way, arrived on the scene, took her gently by the hand, and led her away into an enormous cave. There he and the rest of the troop set before her a large number of apples, nuts, and various roots and, with a nod, invited her to eat. When she had finished, the wild creature forced her to have sex with him, an outrage he continued without interruption for many days, the result being that she gave birth to two children. The unhappy woman how much more preferable would death have been!-lived like this for several years until God in His mercy sent a ship there from Portugal. The soldiers came ashore to fetch water from a spring which was next to the cave, and by good fortune the monkey was not there. The woman came running up to the first human beings she had seen for a long time, threw herself at their feet, and begged them to take her away from \[the monkey\'s\] villainy and \[her\] appalling slavery. They took pity on her misfortune and agreed to take her on board with them. But-and I\'d like you to notice this point-the monkey bore down on them and, with uncouth gestures and deep growls, called back his \'wife\' (nonwife). When he saw that the sails had been spread, he ran forward and held up one of the children to its mother, threatening that if she did not come back, he would hurl it into the sea; and he was not slow in carrying out his threat. Then he dashed back to the cave and just as quickly returned to the shore, holding up the other child, made his threat, and drowned it, after which he pursued the ship closely, raging all the time, and swimming after it as long as he could until the waves proved too strong for him. The whole of Portugal can bear witness to this very famous incident. The King condemned the woman to be burned in Lisbon, but because of the prayers of certain people who begged for her life, he commuted the death sentence to perpetual imprisonment.

Are you astonished, Reader? Look for yourself at Saxo Grammaticus and \[Johannes\] Magnus and \[Olaus\] Magnus, Bishops of Uppsala. They tell a story about Gothic kings who are descended from \[the union of\] a bear and a noble virgin, and João de Barros \[who tells us\] about the Pegusian and Sianitan tribes of India who are descended from a dog which mated with a woman.
[Page 62]

Actually, I do not put much faith in these tales because I am sure that a real human being cannot be born from \[intercourse between\] a human and an animal. An animal\'s seed lacks that completeness which is required to house such a noble soul, so if anything is born from intercourse of this kind, it will be a monster, not a human because a foetus of this kind conforms to the condition of the inferior seed and in consequence at best it will produce something which merely looks human. I cannot believe that a brute beast which has one or other parent of this kind can be considered fully complete. (The children born to the Portuguese woman, for example, were neither monkeys nor humans). It is, rather, a monster of a mixed type which is neither one thing nor the other, such as a mule, which comes from a horse and an ass, or a jackal, which comes from a hyena and a wolf. A story told by the judicious historian Pedro Cieza \[de León\] confirms this opinion. He tells us that the men of the Andes are accustomed to have sex with huge monkeys, and that the children born from this union have a human head and private parts, while the rest of them resembles a monkey. They are wild and ugly, they do not speak but shriek in a terrifying manner, and the Indians themselves consider them to be monsters. Lastly, in the province of Aulaga, an Indian woman bore three monsters to a dog. (See his History of Peru, Part 1, chapter 95.)

Moreover, in some of the exemplary stories I have cited, an image-making energy, corruption of the seed, and an abundance of superfluous humours in the womb can each lay claim to its own role, and in addition to this, it can be the case that some women belonging to this group are to be counted as witches \[strigum\] and an evil spirit, acting as an incubus, has poured the hot seed of these creatures into them. Why can someone who misuses human \[seed\] this way not also be able to misuse that of a wild animal? I certainly think it can be said of the exemplary stories about the Indian peoples and the Gothic kings that an evil spirit forced himself on the women in the likeness of this kind of creature, and the following Question will inform you that he does have this ability. To these examples I add a story which is entirely true. Right here in the Spanish Netherlands there was an abominable individual who had sex with a cow. People later saw that the cow had become pregnant, and after a few months she gave birth to a male offspring-not a calf, but a boy. More than one person was present to see him falling from the womb of his mother, the cow.

They picked him up from the ground and handed him over to a wet nurse. The boy grew up, was baptised and instructed in the precepts of the Christian religion, dedicated himself to the practice of religion and, on his father\'s behalf, earnestly devoted himself to works of penitence. To be sure, he was a complete human being, but one whose mind had bovine leanings which made him want to graze in the fields and chew the cud. What is one to make of this? Wasn\'t he a human being? I believe he clearly was, but I deny that the cow was his mother. Why do I do so? The Devil knew about his father\'s sin-indeed, he instigated it-and shortly afterwards made it looks as though the cow was pregnant. Then, at a time of his choosing, he produced an infant he had stolen from someone else and placed it under the cow, (which was \[actually\] \'pregnant\' with wind), while she was \'in labour\', with the result that \[the child\] appeared to be produced by the cow.
[Page 63]

In consequence, a piece of fantasy was born, and the boy was persuaded he was the son of a cow. His imagination got to work and so he thought he had imbibed certain propensities from his supposed mother. To think that he was a real human being born from material provided by bovine seed, and that the fully formed organic arrangement of a human body was achieved in the womb of a cow by means of the heat and power of a bovine soul is something I think all natural philosophers will agree with me should be reckoned as one of the áδúvata \[impossibilities\].

But when Manilius ascribes the production of monsters to influxes from the stars and the destiny Stoics talk about, that is the madness of someone who belongs to an \[heretical\] sect.

\'\[There is a power which\] often joins the bodies of wild animals To those of humans. The offspring will not come from their seed. What do we have in common with wild animals, Or what adulterer has committed the crime of giving birth to a monster? The stars fashion strange shapes, and the sky has sown hybrid creatures\', \[Astronomica 4.102-105\].

Yet Andrea Cesalpino\'s paradox \[says\] that fully complete beasts-horses, oxen, elephants, and indeed a human being, as far as his body is concerned can be born simply as a result of the heat of the sun and putrefaction, and he tries to prove this with many \[arguments\] in his Peripatetic Questions, Book 5, question 1, according to which it would follow that all these things can be produced magically by the application of active things to passive. I have not yet been able to be convinced or believe that this is true. I am not unaware that the preparation of matter for the forms of living things which are called \'fully formed\' depends on a generative and formative power which has the job of fashioning the fully formed human being, but not on the mixture of primary properties and the measured constitution it receives from an influx out of the heavens and the heat of the sun.

It demands in addition the co-operation of a fully finished living being, as all theologians and natural philosophers acknowledge. My Jesuit brethren from Coimbra cite these, too, in their learned rebuttal of this falsehood-see their commentary on \[Aristotle\'s\] De Caelo, Book 2, chapter 3, question 6, articles 3 and 4-and I urge you, inquisitive Reader, to read them. Consider this point, too. To say that a human being is begotten this way is either self-contradictory, or merely says that a monster can be begotten-indeed, not a monster, because it is \[actually\] something without a soul. My question, you see, is, by what \[power\] will the lump of a human being be animated with a soul? Human? But this is Paracelsus\'s madness and heretical, as I have pointed out elsewhere. Animal? But the soul of animals cannot inform a human body because that requires a quite different balance of its constituent parts, entirely unlike that \[required\] by the soul of an OX and a dog. It is generally agreed that a dog\'s body cannot be informed by the soul of an OX, so what kind of a thing is this monster, or what will it be?

It is certain that a monster is sometimes born as a punishment from God. The punishment meted out to the Frieslanders of Dokkum because they murdered the saintly bishop, Boniface, and his companions tells us as much. \'God,\' says Kempius, \'has avenged the shameful death of these saints upon the children \[of those people\'s\] children, with the result that to this day random members of the families whose ancestors carried out such a wicked crime have thick whitish hair on the back of their head, rather like a brute animal\'s tail.
[Page 64]

So, you might justly say, \"Their descendants still feel \[the result of what \[our original\] parents did\". Thus, Cornelius Kempius from Dokkum in Book 2, chapter 21 of his Origin of the Frisians. Let me imitate Samson and link tails together. In Book 13 of his English History, Polydore Vergil writes to this effect. King Henry II was beginning to reveal himself as an enemy of the holy man, St Thomas of Canterbury. \'\[St Thomas\] started to be so slighted, despised, and hated by the common people that on one occasion when he came to Strode, a village on the bank of the River Medway, a river which flows near Rochester, the inhabitants of that area, eager to inflict some dishonour on the good Father they so despised, did not hesitate to cut off the tail of the horse he was riding, thus bringing down a perpetual disgrace on themselves: because afterwards, in accordance with God\'s will, it turned out that all the members of the family which had committed that crime were born with tails, as though they were brute beasts. But that mark of infamy, together with the family of those individuals, has long since disappeared.\'

This is what Polydore says. God knows whether he attached the last clause to please \[his readers or because it was true. Certainly the whole race joined in the abusive insult and it \[still\] persists among shameless individuals who, with their rather freakish language, have nothing of importance \[to say\] and babble, whether \[what they say\] is true or false. If any remnant of this disgrace were still in existence, William Tooker would have attributed to his queen the wonderful power of being able to remove this appendage. A further passage: I find in Book 2 Thomas of Cantimpré\'s work entitled Bees that a certain nobleman profaned feast days by going hunting, and his wife bore him a child with the distended jaws of a dog and the long floppy ears of \'hounds\', as they call them.

186 Polydore Vergil, (c.1470-1555), Italian historian who lived for many years in England. His Historia Anglica was printed in 1534, although it had been written several years before that. This quotation comes from Book 13, section 7.

Book 2, Question 15

Do evil spirits \[known as\] incubi and succubae ever exist, and can offspring be born from this kind of \[sexual\] intercourse?¹⁸⁸

Axiom 1: Male workers of harmful magic and \[female\] witches \[malefici et lamiae\] are accustomed to carry out the sexual act with evil spirits, the former with succubi, the latter with incubi. Several heretics, (indeed the majority of them), falsely deny this. So do some Catholics, but not very many-Philippe Broïde from the Spanish Netherlands and \[Girolamo\] Cardano, \[Gianfrancesco\] Ponzinibio, and \[Giam battista della Porta from Italy-but the influence of these men is not great if you compare it with those who maintain the opposite. What this axiom says has been so convincing to many people that one should be afraid of being obstinate and rash if one disagrees with them. This is also an opinion common to the Fathers \[of the Church\], theologians, and learned natural philosophers, and one verified by the experience of all ages and nations. So that I do not have to list everybody, \[let me mention that Plato in his Cratylus, Philo, Josephus, ancient Judaism, St Cyprian, St Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian were in agreement \[about this\], as well as others who have quite rightly felt that, in as much as the more ancient Fathers thought that evil spirits can do the deed with women, they are justly rebuked by more recent \[scholars\], because they interpreted the words of Moses about the sons of God and the daughters of Cain as referring to this kind of copulation.

Consequently, I think one can select more substantial approval of the opinion \[expressed in Axiom 1\] from chapter 6 of St Jerome\'s commentary on St Paul\'s letter to the Ephesians, and from St Augustine who, along with St Isidore, is followed by the general school of theologians. The Bull of Pope Innocent VIII against workers of harmful magic \[maleficos\] does battle on behalf of that same \[opinion\]. These points are proved and explained at the same time by reason. Evil spirits, (as I shall discuss later), can assume the bodies of dead people, or fashion afresh and shape for themselves out of air and other elements \[bodies\] which feel like flesh to the touch. These they can move about as they wish and give them warmth. By artifice they can make a show of sexuality they do not possess naturally, and abuse men by appearing to them as a woman, and women by appearing to them as a man. They counterfeit women and lie underneath the men. They can also bring along real semen taken from someone else and imitate a man\'s natural emission. Therefore, they are able to do everything the first axiom says they can, and since they can do so, (and experience tells us that they do), there is no reason for us to doubt it.
[Page 65]

Axiom 2: Offspring can be born from this kind of copulation with an evil spirit acting as an incubus. There is greater difficulty attached to this axiom, but it is removed when the whole topic is explained properly and clearly. One needs to be aware, then, that the Devil can transfer semen he has taken from someone else-during the nocturnal emission which happens while a man is asleep, for example; and because he is nimble and has practical experience of Nature, he can preserve procreative heat in the seed, no matter how delicate, airy, and easily dispersed that \[heat\] may be; and finally, at the moment the woman is in the best state to conceive-and he is well aware of when that moment happenshe pours it into her womb via intercourse, or produces it to be drawn there by its natural force, and so mingle with the woman\'s seed. (The authors I shall be citing later have held to this conclusion.)

Axiom 3: Evil spirits, however, cannot, as living creatures do, generate life by their own power and from their own substance. The proof of this is that evil spirits do not multiply among themselves either individually or as a species. Evil spirits do not have a body made of air or any other kind \[of body\] at all as, contrary to the Platonists, Marco Antonio Natta has told us in his treatise on God, Book 7, folio 75; and this is what Francesco Giorgi and \[Tommaso\] Cajetan think, too.

Consequently, they cannot take part in sex in their own body, (as \[Benito\] Pereira explains very well in Book 8, dispute 2); nor do they have any semen, still less any, however weak, which is procreative. (This was the mistake made by Marcus of Ephesus, Josephus, and perhaps Athenagoras, Tertullian, and the more ancient Fathers). How can they have their own semen when semen is part of a living physical substance and, according to the opinion of the better writers, what is left over from very well digested food? But evil spirits are incorporeal substances and therefore cannot furnish physical semen from their own \[body\]. They also lack a soul, and the function of a quickening soul is to use its natural heat to digest the food \[the body\] has received. Therefore this axiom, which the authors cited in the preceding axiom acknowledge, is fully proven-and certain writers of great repute, such as St \[John\] Chrysostom and others, whose opinion I reported and explained some time ago in my commentary on Seneca\'s Hercules Furens, verse 447, have at least been willing to maintain this conclusion and have not denied the conclusion which precedes it.

Opponents sometimes object that these are exemplary stories about silly deluded women. I neither rebut these \[stories\] nor reject them, especially those marvels brought forward as witnesses by \[Nicolas Jacquier and Martin of Arles. But I do maintain that \[objectors\] draw improper inferences from them and are sometimes deluded, and therefore \[what they infer is never accurate \[because\] from a positive particular they deduce a universal which is also positive, and in a topic which is unsuited to it this is inept.

So, I say that a child can sometimes be born as the result of sexual intercourse between an incubus and a woman, but in these circumstances the real father of the child will not be the evil spirit but the human male whose semen the evil spirit has misused. Plutarch in \[his life of\] Numa, the heretic Paracelsus, Ulrich Molitor in the final chapter of Women Who Foretell the Future, and Nicholas Rémy in Book 1, chapter 6 of his Worship of Evil Spirits, have denied this, but the arguments with which they prop themselves up are insignificant. My fellow-Jesuit, Benito Pereira, does not deny it, although he does have his doubts, (Book 8, disputation 3 of his commentary on Genesis.) But in times past the Egyptians acknowledged it, as Plutarch bears witness, and so generally did the Schoolmen, all of whom were very good natural philosophers. It is proved by clear reason from what I said during my explanation of the second axiom.
[Page 66]

Very many exemplary stories told by those \[authors\] and others are in agreement and if they are true, they should undoubtedly be explained in accordance with these conclusions. Antiquity swallows its demi-gods, Hercules, Sarpedon, Aeneas, the Servii Tulli: England its Merlin: and Pannonia the Huns born from the Gothic witches \[strigibus\] of Arlon and fairies. In chapter 27, part 2 of his history of Peru, Cieza writes that in Hispaniola an evil spirit called Corcoton was in the habit of having sex with women, and the children born as a result of this had two horns. Hélinand reported the same in reference to the Dukes of Cleves, (he is quoted in Book 4 of \[the Speculum Historiale\] by Vincent de Beauvais); the Japanese say their Xaca is the same kind of person; and there is no lack of people who say that Luther falls into this category. Six years ago, in the leading town of Brabant, a woman was punished because she had borne a child to an evil spirit, and Luis Molina, a theologian of the Society of Jesus, has published that this has also happened during the present day. Several other writers from different nations, too, have confirmed it and reported examples of it.

You see now how flimsy are the arguments with which others oppose this opinion, especially Nicholas Rémy. His first argument is: (i) an evil spirit and a human being belong to different species and therefore offspring cannot follow from their copulation. My reply is that that consequence does not follow, partly because mules, jackals, leopards, panthers, and other hybrids are born from a stallion and a she-ass and other creatures which are different in kind, and partly because in this case generation is not attributable to the evil spirit, but to the man whose semen it is, as St Thomas \[Aquinas\] correctly says in Quodlibet 6, article 8, answer to argument 6, and therefore in this case the human being is born from the man and the woman.

\(ii\) He argues that an evil spirit knows nothing about how life and death begin, and therefore he cannot be the originator and source of a life-giving act. My answer is that the life-giving power does not belong to the evil spirit but to the semen itself, just as the power to warm does not belong to the cup with which one pledges someone\'s health, or to the spout which pours out \[the wine, but to the wine itself. (See St Thomas, the work cited above, answer to 5, and \[Jakob\] Sprenger, Malleus \[Maleficarum\], Part 1, question 4, answer to argument 2.)

\(iii\) He argues that witches \[sagae\] say that the semen which the evil spirit pours into them is cold and makes them shudder rather than feel pleasure, and that therefore it will not be possible for generation to follow. This was the argument of Marcus of Ephesus as quoted by Psellus. Rémy confirms it from the confession made by witches \[sagarum\] who said that all sense of pleasure is absent from such a copulation and that they find it extremely painful.

My reply is that the worthlessness of this argument forces me to spend more time than I might wish on refuting something which is both inane and disgusting. So it seems certain that when an evil spirit wishes to deceive by taking on the appearance of a particular man and does not want anyone to know he is an evil spirit, he can give a most exact imitation of whatever is required during copulation between a real man and a woman; and therefore, if he actually does want generation to follow-something which very rarely happens, since he himself never intends generation to take place because of him, because he cannot procreate anything like himself, although sometimes, at least, he does attempt generation by means of another male\'s semen which is collected by a tart \[succuba\] who does this for him as a favour-on that occasion he necessarily takes care to employ what is necessary for the purpose.
[Page 67]

Therefore, he seeks out procreative semen, and when he has found it he preserves it and brings it back so quickly that its live-giving essence \[vitalis spiritus\] does not evaporate. Then when it is needed, he pours out however much is required. But when he does intend that generation \[should follow\], he pours out something which is like semen, but hot so that his deception is not discovered. Likewise, he also tempers the body he has assumed so that the woman\] will not be struck by fear or dread or disdain at its touch. But when he does the deed with women who are aware he is an evil spirit, he most often produces semen which is unreal and cold, and I grant that offspring cannot be born from that. Secondly, it is well-known he often asks tarts \[succubas\], \'Do you really want to be impregnated?\' If these women say yes, he obtains real semen which has fallen during the carnal act somewhere else, as I have said and as \[Jakob\] Sprenger tells us. But the question arises not so much in relation to what \[the evil spirit\] usually does as to what he is able to do, and the answer in confirmation of this argument is obvious.

When a sense of pleasure is not present, it is not present either because God providentially prevents it, or because the evil spirit wishes it not to be present so that the sin\'s filthiness and wickedness may be greater. This sense, however, can be present if God does not prevent it and the evil spirit wants the tart to feel it. Indeed, it is well known that everything requisite for pleasure has been provided by an evil spirit acting as incubus. \[Jakob\] Sprenger, \[Peter\] Binsfeld, and \[Lorenzo\] d\'Anania give a very large number of examples, and there is one in particular about a wise-woman \[saga\] from Sardis, and a noble Spanish virgin who was deceived. (You can find this in \[Antonio de\] Torquemada, dialogue 3. See also \[Paolo\] Grillando, question 7, nos. 8 & 9. Alfonso a Castro makes the same point by means of a confession \[he records\] in The Just Punishment of Heretics, Book 1, chapter 16.)

Lastly, they add that one cannot believe that God agrees with this kind of act or invests the body of someone born as a result of this kind of copulation with a soul and \[so\] adds a final flourish to the work begun by an evil spirit. My reply is that in this case, as far as the working of Nature is concerned, the evil spirit is simply an instrument and merely directs the principal agent, which is the human semen: and that therefore God agrees to the final balance of the constituent parts of an organic body which has been born from the human semen, but that something which is a casual incident is also simply a moral matter, a sin in the case of the witch \[sagae\] and malice in the case of the evil spirit. God, as Nature\'s creator, is not pleased to prop up Nature by means of a real sin which He did not create. If arguments of this kind were worth anything, it would follow that offspring could not be produced from fornication, or adultery, or incest. They answer that the reasoning is different, since in these cases Nature\'s order is preserved, but not in the evil spirit\'s nuptial arrangement. This answer is frivolous because in the case I have given, Nature\'s order is preserved with respect to the main physical principles of generation, since Nature demands merely that offspring be born from the procreative seed of a man suitably mixed with that of a woman. Ulrich Molitor argues that, according to the Conciliator \[by Pietro d\'Abano\], procreation begins with the heart and therefore an evil spirit cannot make use of that seed for generation because the heart lacks the necessary power to temper its heat. My reply is that whether the power to procreate arises from the heart or the head, a generative vapour \[spiritus\] is implanted in the seed itself in the very separation of the seed from the body \[during procreation\], and the evil spirit merely preserves this vapour along with its heat.
[Page 68]

So why, someone may say, will it be possible for children to be born from a man acting as an incubus and an evil spirit acting as his tart? Long ago the Egyptians did not agree that this can happen, and I do not believe it can, either, because for this to take place mothers have to supply very much more than fathers for the procreation and birth of offspring, and the efforts of each party are by no means equal. After \[the coital act\], everything concerns the mother alone. A period of time is required for the seed to be changed into an organic body and for the building of the human body to be finished and brought to a complete conclusion. The uninterrupted operation of the quickening soul is also required for the nourishment of the foetus, and other, almost innumerable secrets of Nature, all of which-no matter how many they may be-I very much doubt, (in fact I rather think), are impossible as long as an evil spirit is able to be in control of the body he has assumed. If he can \[remain in control\], even then the tart will be able to conceive. Meanwhile, someone may demonstrate that those whom we read have been born to an evil spirit acting as tart and mother have either been substituted for the genuine children of another woman, or are offspring fabricated by another evil spirit, as not infrequently happens, too, in the case of the first example of a substituted child.

I am perfectly willing to note, along with Johann Reynardus, that celebrated histories of the French refer to the origin of the Counts of Poitou from Melusine \[a fairy\]. Polydore Vergil says the same about the genealogy of the Angevin family; Vincent de Beauvais, relying on Geoffrey \[of Monmouth\], tells the same story about someone else; and Sabinus relates a story he was told by the Dukes of Bavaria and Saxony.¹⁹⁸ What others say about a Bavarian nobleman is not dissimilar. He was bearing the death of his wife without much fortitude, \[but\] one night the woman came back to him and said she had returned to life. She convinced her husband \[of this\] and conceived children by him. At length, however-and this is something she had predicted-she vanished, leaving behind her woman\'s dress with her husband who did not refrain from uttering loud reproaches and blasphemies. An evil spirit thus cheated the nobleman and foisted upon him children it had stolen from someone else. To the second category of fraud, I refer little children who are not born from incubi but through fraud, as though they came from evil spirits acting as tarts. The common folk call these \'exchanges\', and say they are so unsatisfied by milk that, even though they had drained four wet-nurses dry, they would continue to be thin. They are, however, very heavy and finally vanish after a number of years. (The Italians call them \'squallers\' because of their continual crying. The Germans, to indicate they are substitutes, call them \'changelings\' or \'exchange-children\'.

On these, see \[Jakob\] Sprenger, The Hammer \[of Witches\], Part 2, question 2, chapter 7 \[8\]; Guillaume d\'Auvergne, The Universe, last part, chapter 25; \[Lorenzo\] D\'Anania, The Character of Evil Spirits, Book 4; and \[Ulrich\] Molitor, Women Who Foretell the Future, chapter 6.) Fifteen years ago, a beggar was carrying a child very painfully on his shoulders through Galicia and the Asturias in Spain, and I think \[the child was one of these changelings. One of my Jesuit brethren found him en route near a river and, moved by pity, took a back seat on his mule so that he could take them across. The strong beast was scarcely able to land them on the other bank. A little later, he caught hold of the beggar who told him that the child was not a child but a devil who had promised him he would inveigle everyone into giving him alms, as long as he would carry \[the devil\] round in the guise of an ailing child swathed in bandages.
[Page 69]

That evil spirits can bring it about that a woman, while remaining in mind and body a virgin, can conceive, although not in the absence of a man\'s seed, is proved because it is possible to pour real, fertile semen take from someone else into a virgin while she is asleep and knows nothing about it, without carnal congress and leaving her hymen and the other barriers belonging to her virginity unimpaired. But an evil spirit is unable to \[make sure\] her virginity is preserved during childbirth, because genuine penetration of bodies is required for this, and virginity \[under those circumstances\] is reserved to the power of God. It cannot be accomplished without a specific miracle. Moreover, since Calvinists deny that this barrier remained closed during the virgin birth of Christ, our Lord, they certainly remove the outstanding special claim that this was a genuine miracle and a real virginity. The exemplary story about a girl from Bamberg, told by \[Johannes\] Nider, should be read with caution and understood simply as one about the virginity of the mind, since she had lost her physical innocence by means of the kind of copulation one has been talking about and had conceived thereby.

A woman cannot be known by a man without the loss of her virginity, and she cannot become pregnant without being known. I am aware of what many writers say about various women who have conceived merely because semen had been spilled earlier in the bath-tub in which they were washing themselves, but I don\'t believe it. I notice André du Laurens denies it, too, in his Anatomical Account, Book 8, question 11, because the power of the womb to attract \[semen\] does not have the ability to extend so far away from itself. Nor does water have the expertise an evil spirit has to stop the evaporation of the semen\'s essential capacities \[spirituum\]; and had the semen been fertile, it would have sunk to the bottom of the water and not floated on top of it. The Jews pretend that Ben Sira was born this way from a daughter of the prophet Jeremiad, but they are lying, because Jeremiah was always a virgin. Averroes makes the same kind of claim, and in chapter 1 of The Formation of a Human, Albertus Magnus talks about another \[such\] woman. Less unbelievable is what St Thomas \[Aquinas\] writes-that perhaps a woman can conceive without a miracle and with her virginity in every way intact, \'as we are told happened\', (he says), \'to a young girl who was just reaching the age of puberty. In order to guard her modesty, her father used to keep her in his bed. \[But\] when he defiled himself while he was dreaming, his semen descended into his daughter\'s womb and therefore the girl became pregnant. This was the result, and in his commentary on Genesis 19, \[Alonso Tostado of Ávila claims that an evil spirit can make the same thing happen.

I am likewise aware one should ask whether evil spirits sometimes practise the same perverted lust with witches \[sagis\] (Judges who try brigands ought to know this.) Some people deny it altogether-for example, a large number who follow the authority of theologians, Antoninus, Compendium Part 1, under the chapter heading, \'On Lust\', \[Gianfrancesco\] Ponzinibio, Vampire Witches, no. 64, and Benedictus, Compendium of Sins, Book 2, chapter 8. It is not found in the confessions of the witches \[sagarum\] from Spain, Germany, or France, but when it comes to the vampire witches \[lamiis\] of Italy, Silvestro \[Mazzolini\] da Prierio claims this in his Hag-Magicians as though it were very well known. So does D\'Anania in his Character of Evil Spirits, Book 4, folio 148, and even Ponzinibio, in the passage cited above, says they confirm it. Indisputably nothing that xxxoupyós \[evil-doer\] thinks of is so despicable. In order to entangle human souls in a more certain death, he offers each person the means whereby he hopes \[that person\] can be captured. There is no crime the dregs of humanity will shun, so judges can look into this as well. Nor is there any convincing argument to the contrary. Furthermore, a confessor should be aware that under those circumstances the mortal sin seems to be twofold-(i) it is contrary to the natural order of things, (ii) it takes place outwith the natural vessel-and therefore it is a more serious sin than if they were to have sex with an evil spirit in human, natural fashion.
[Page 70]

A final uncertainty arises in \[the form of\] this question: can it happen that giants, or pygmies, may be born as a result of the power of magic? In the case of giants, Francisco Vallés maintains in chapter 8 that it is possible if the spirits do not select just any kind of semen, but that which is abundant, very thick, very hot, overflowing with vital essences \[spiritibus\], and free from serum. \[He says\] it is easy for them to procure this by choosing men who are hot, robust, and have plenty of semen for those with whom they have sex, and women who are of the same kind of nature as those with whom they have sex. \'The pleasure brought to both of them, men and women, by the discharge of semen, is greater the more abundantly\', (he says), \'it is emitted. Moreover, they can increase the pleasure by titillating their imagination a lot and letting it picture most of what they are doing in that activity, because most of the impulses to make love flow from the imagination. Consequently, men devoted to the monastic life and so dedicated to God that they curb even their imagination, do not feel this kind of impulse. Evil spirits, therefore, were able to bring about the birth of robust, fully-grown men\'. That learned man, at once natural philosopher and philosopher, tells us very clearly what could have happened, but he is mistaken to the extent that he thinks the giants of Holy Scripture were produced from evil spirits in the forms of incubi and succubi. I have already said that this has been disproved by theologians, and for this reason I maintain merely that this does not run contrary to what an evil spirit can do and intend to do, since one cannot deny that giants were the result of shameless wantonness. Holy Scripture bears witness to it in Genesis, chapter 6.

The chronicles of all nations offer many similar \[instances\] Diodorus, Books 5 and 9; Plutarch, Sertorius; Philostratus, Heroicus; Pliny; Solinus; Marianus Scotus; and others.²⁰³ I recall I noted several \[examples\] in my Commentaries on Seneca\'s Tragedies, and I am astonished that Jan Gerartsen van Gorp decided to make such a fuss about the stories told about our giant in Antwerp. He could not cope with how large its tooth was. But how big was it in comparison with the larger molars of the Sicilian Cyclopes which the celebrated historian, Tommaso Fazello, saw and had in his possession? I think my fellow-citizens will not find it unpleasant to read what he has to say, so that they do not allow this treasure of their ancient history to be taken away from them so easily by someone from Kempen.

The subject is clearly an extensive one. I shall write down brief extracts \[from Fazello\]. In 1342, a corpse was found in a cave on Mt Eryx. It was of a quite extraordinary size and part of the back of its skull had the capacity of several Sicilian pecks. (Boccaccio mentions it, too, in Book 4, chapter 28 of his Genealogy of the Gods). In 1516 in the territory of Mazzarino, masons dug up the corpse of someone about twenty cubits tall. Its head was the size of a large round cask, and each of its molars weighed five ounces. \[Fazello\] says he saw them, and that he had in his possession not a few other teeth belonging to giants which were dug up in Melilli, \[each\] weighing four ounces, and that he also possessed the almost preternaturally wide shoulder-blade of another giant from Hyccara \[Carini\]. In 1547, Simeone Pigliono gave him two other molars, each weighing four ounces, from a corpse eighteen cubits tall, \[which had been found\] near Palermo.

In the following year, another corpse was discovered there by Giorgio Adorno, twenty cubits tall; and in 1550 a corpse was found at Calatrasi about twenty-two cubits tall, whose head measured about ten feet round. \[Fazello\] adds many similar \[examples\], but there is no reason for me to spend time enumerating each one of them. He notes the fact that although the rest of the bones fell to dust at a touch, the teeth remained intact. They were like ours, but bigger, whitish in colour, and free from decay. One used to see this long ago in the tooth from Antwerp as well. The British writer \[William\] Camden mentions an ancient epigram by Antonius Pomponius Letus about Etruscan giants, and others \[mention epigrams\] about others. St Augustine himself writes that he saw a molar on the shore of Utica so big it could match a hundred ordinary molars, (The City of God, Book 15, chapter 9). I pass over what Francesco Patrizi said through the mouth of Hammun, about the Ephemim and the Gigim, because it is a fairy-story.
[Page 71]

Now I must talk about pygmies. \[It is said\] that there can be no doubt that an evil spirit is able to fashion them once he had employed methods which stop them from growing and result in their not reaching the proper height of the human body. Thus, we see that human ingenuity contrives those tiny pups which are the delight of young women by making them drink brandy and confining them in little pots; and parents who are greedy for cash use certain drugs, (in a fashion undoubtedly contrary to religion), so that their children will be born as dwarfs. But I am entirely convinced that in this situation there is also a minimum size of the human body, even if we do not know what that is, below which the rational soul cannot use its powers and inform the body effectively.

Consequently, I agree with those writers who, although they acknowledge there are people a cubit tall or manikins three spans high, whom they call \'pygmies\', the enemies of cranes, and which Philostratus in Hercules Asleep, Pliny Book 7, chapter 2, Claudian, Juvenal, Solinus, and others have described, following Aristotle, Inquiry into Living Things Book 2, chapter 12, correctly think that these are not real human beings, but animals or monsters, and should be classed as monkeys. (Please see \[Aulus\] Gellius, Book 9, chapter 4; Caelius Rhodiginus, Ancient Readings Book 4, chapter 3; \[Girolamo\] Cardano, The Variety of Nature Book 8; \[Juan\] Luis Vives, \[Commentary on St Augustine\'s\] City of God, chapter 8; and Bonifacio Simonetta Letters Book 4, chapter 10. Fr. Ruiz writes in his letters, which I read in 1601, that a province of dwarfs was found in Peru in 1600.)

It cannot be denied that pygmies have existed, and that their height was very short, too. I gather both \[meanings\] from Ezekiel 27.11, Pygmies were in your towers\'. I know this is translated in different ways, and St Jerome gives more than one version of this passage. But mine has quite properly followed Aquila who translates it as \'pygmies.\' Symmachus translates it as \'Medes\', and Theodoret agrees with him. The Aramaic paraphraser renders it \"Cappadocians\'. But the root of the word is the \[Hebrew\] G, and therefore Theodotion is not altogether sure what the Hebrew would mean. I have retained the Hebrew \[word\] GMDYM, \'gamadim\'. St Jerome is aware that GDM means \'an arm\'s length measurement\' or \'cubit\', Judges 3.16. Hence GMD (\'cubit\') translates as \'pygmies\', this being a reference to how tall they are. Likewise, St Jerome, considering Aquila\'s Greek word, did not accept \'pygmies\' as a proper noun, but as an appellative, because he translates it as \'warriors in full readiness\', as if it derived from πuruñs, one translation of which is \'fight\' or \'boxer\', the other, \'a cubit\'s measurement.

That is the one followed by St Augustine in The City of God Book 16, chapter 7. This is why differences of translation arose, and when it came to those people properly called \'pygmies\', people thought it a good idea to accept \[both\]. Certain \[writers\] pretend \[that pygmies\] were very warlike, had very accurate eyesight, and were very skilled archers, and that this is why they were entrusted with the guardianship of the towers. (This is what Dionysius the Carthusian says).

But what is their proof of this? It is scarcely credible that \[pygmies\] could have penetrated a breastplate with their darts. So, Nicholas of Lyra devised another, quite ingenious \[interpretation\], saying that the stronghold and fortification of Tyre was being described, and that this was of such a kind that its towers could be defended against the most powerful enemies even by those dwarfish creatures. This \[interpretation\], too, is distorted and does not pay sufficient attention to, and is not consistent with, the context. It is my firm opinion that the text mentions \'guards\' or \'lusty men\', as the Septuagint translates it, and that these are called \'pygmies\', not because of their height, but because the towers were so tall that even the bravest and largest men appeared scarcely a cubit tall to those at the bottom looking upwards. Consequently, I think this is how one should reconcile the Vulgate with the Septuagint and with the Hebrew original. (I am prepared to follow someone who tells us something which is more convincing.)
[Page 72]

In his Library, folio 3, Photius refers to what Nonnosus says about these dwarfs. \'While Nonnosus was sailing from Pharsa, he came to the furthest of the islands where a remarkable, unheard of thing happened. He came across some \[creatures\] which had the shape and appearance of human beings but were very short in stature and black in colour. Their whole body was covered in thick hair. Their women came along with them, and their children who were even shorter than the men. They were all naked, except that the older men and women concealed their shameful parts with a small piece of skin. They did not seem to be fierce or wild. They did have a human voice, but their language was unknown to everyone who lived round about them\'.

Book 2, Question 16

The nocturnal meetings of witches \[sagarum\]. Are these women really transported from one place to another?

The principal opinion is that those women are present at this kind of equitation and meeting simply because that is what they think they are doing, and because they are taking part in an illusion \[created by\] the Devil. Many sectaries hold this opinion, as did Luther and Melanchthon. But certain Catholics do, as well: among the Spanish, the Franciscan, Fr. Samuel in a whole book, the author of The Fortress of the Faith, and the canon lawyer, Martin of Arles; among the Italians, \[Gianfrancesco\] Ponzinibio in almost a whole book, \[Giambattista\] della Porta in Book 2 of his Natural Magic, and \[Andrea\] Alciato, Supplement Book 8, chapter 22. (At his time, the topic had not yet been investigated satisfactorily.) Among the French are \[François\] Douaren, \[Pierre\] Ayrault, and Michel Montaigne; among the English in earlier times, John of Salisbury, Polycraticus Book 2, the end of chapter 17; among the Germans, Philipp Camerarius has the same opinion at the end of chapter 72 of his Works of Occasional Hours, and Ulrich Molitor, Women Who Foretell the Future, chapter 8. (Leonardo Vairo also hints that this is what he thinks in The Evil Eye Book 2, chapter 13.

They rely, however, upon arguments which are not especially telling. After all, why is this claim made only by women, as it turns out in Alciato? For what reason do so many learned and famous men, sensible according to the age \[we live in\], say the same thing every day and are punished for it? Yes, there may often exist people who are deluded by an evil spirit which has overwhelmed their internal and external organs of sensory perception and lulled them to sleep, and perhaps even damaged their imagination and thrown it into confusion. Yes, after he has damaged someone\'s physical powers and mental faculties, the Devil may be able to make more sights convincing to him than those which people overpowered by a lot of wine or sick with melancholia think they are seeing, as St Augustine tells us. There may, of course, be three kinds of mental image, as \[St Augustine\] knew perfectly well. So, what follows from that? What can you infer from these points other than that witches \[sagas\] can be deceived? But it does not follow from this that the women are always mistaken, nor does it offer stronger proof of what he said when he wrote to Evodius about the extraordinary things people see.

I acknowledge that at that time souls did not leave their bodies, and I detest the fact that \[Jean\] Bodin was rash enough to say they did. I acknowledge that the physical senses are often clearly in a state of unconsciousness, and that \[mental\] images can make such a powerful impression that after people wake up, they believe they have heard, seen, and done things which have never happened. Nor am I unaware of many examples of this \[sensory\] deception: the defendant, for example, who kept on saying he had been in Pluto\'s kingdom; Gennadius who used to think he had taken part in the choirs of the blessed; the Platonist philosopher \[who said\] that another \[philosopher\] used to appear to him in dreams and give him instruction; and the father who, in spite of seeing his daughter in broad daylight, thought he was looking at a cow. Nor does it weigh with me that their bodies have frequently been found lying in the same spot and have not moved from there, as Olaus \[Magnus\], \[Alonso\] Tostado, \[Paolo\] Grillando, and others have told us about various individuals. Pertinent to this is an incident in the life of St Germanus about women \[mulierculis\] who thought they were at a party when, in fact, they were found to be asleep at home-and so on and so forth. Nothing more is proved by these \[examples\] than that these women \[mulierculas\] are sometimes deceived. But there is no proof that this is always the case, and indeed there could be some force to the argument in Alciato\'s question, why can we not say that an evil spirit was at the meeting in place of the woman rather than that she was in bed with her husband?
[Page 73]

If we used to depend on presumption alone \[in the past\], we are not moved by it now, but by the unanimity of all ages and nations, and by the confession of defendants of both sexes, even those who hold office in the Church and those of noble rank. Against this, no presumption has force. Michal deceived her father\'s attendants by substituting a statue in place of David \[in his bed\] This is how an evil spirit can and usually does deceive the husband, by assuming \[his wife\'s\] body and placing it in the bed. You see, once the night-flying witch \[strige\] has set out for her meeting, \[the evil spirit\] usually plunges the husband into a deep sleep so that he does not realise she has gone away, or he puts something to take the women\'s \[sic\] place so that if the husband wakes up, he can think it is his wife. We learn this from court records.

Certain of them say: \'At Forbach, on 1st September 1587, a female hairdresser made known that she had often done this, and that in order to put her husband into this kind of sleep, with her right hand she smeared his ear with the ointment she was in the habit of using on herself when she wanted to go to this kind of meeting, and then pinched it. Eller, the wife of the dean \[of a guild\] in Oettingen, in the same place and on the same day said she had put a child\'s bolster \[in her place\], and Seichen May from Speirchen \[said she had substituted\] some thin branches. Both said they had first pronounced the name of their evil spirit, and that they had often deceived their husbands this way. In Homburg, on 5th June 1590, Maria, the wife of a tailor in Metzer Esch, \[said she substituted\] a bundle of straws she had sullied with something like ointment, and that this would vanish at once when she came back home. Catharine Ruffa declared that her evil spirit himself had sometimes taken her place in the bed. These \[examples come from\] Nicholas Rémy, \[The Worship of Evil Spirits\] Book 1, chapter 12.

In addition to this, objectors say that in St Augustine\'s Spirit and Soul, chapter 28, where you have almost the same words as the canon Episcopi, it is a good idea that those who put their trust in the incantations of silly old women of this sort²¹⁶ be excommunicated. This canon is the Achilles of one\'s opponents: they press it \[on one\], they hurl it \[at one\]. My reply is that that book is not by St Augustine, or even by St Gregory to whom the Carmelite Jan van Beets attributed it in Book 1, exposition 4, chapter 4 of his \[Commentary on the Ten\] Commandments, but by Hugh de Saint Victor or Hugo Etherianus. Whoever wrote, its opinion is the same as that of the foresaid canon. Certain people make light of the authority of the canon on the grounds that it is \[that of\] a merely provincial Council which could have erred. But I have no intention of taking refuge in that. Others deny it \[came from\] the Council of Ancyra because today it does not appear in the Greek or Latin transcripts of this Council.

This solution, however, does not please me, either, because the canon is found in a number of ancient collections of Councils\' \[decrees\], in the Lives of the Pontiffs by Damasus, (if he was the author of them), in Burchard\'s Decrees Book 10, chapter 1, and those of Ivo, part 11, chapter 30, and it was correctly preserved in Gratian\'s Decrees by order of Pope Gregory XIII. I prefer, along with \[Juan de\] Torquemada \[on Gratian\], \[Hugh de\] St-Victor number 32, \[Bernardus\] Basinus, Alfonso a Castro, and others, to reply that certain things are related in that canon which cannot, in the nature of things, be done by an evil spirit, such as speaking to and personally seeing Hercules and Achilles who are in Hell. Likewise, riding on real animals, which cannot cover such great distances so quickly or \[go\] through the air. Likewise, riding with Diana or Herodias, since there no such goddess as Diana survives, and the little dancing-girl Herodias mentioned \[in the canon\] does not ride anywhere on earth because she has been put on the rack in Hell. Likewise, acknowledging any divine nature other than God, because making this kind of statement would actually be heretical.
[Page 74]

Other things, however, which are not incompatible with the nature of things and do not surpass Satan\'s power are mentioned in this same canon-for example, the actual subject one is dealing with at the moment, and the canon does not deny that such things can happen. Its intention was simply to point out that one should not believe they always happen aútorpooonws \[personally\], but that sometimes they should be attributed to a fault in one\'s imagination. Therefore, what the canon makes clear is correct: those who believe the claims of witches \[sagis\] that everything which happens later and everything which happens earlier does happen to them, (which is the story those women used to tell), are condemned as heretics. It is enough, you see, for the condemnation of any opinion that any part of it be contrary to the Faith, because something is true when it is entire, \[whereas\] any defect renders it untrue. This is how I interpret what Dr Navarrius has said\[a man\] who misleads not a few people because of his rather confused way of putting things.

Consequently, it appears that neither the canon I have been talking about, nor the passage from Hugh \[de Saint-Victor\] are contrary to the common opinion of theologians, or the received practice of inquisitors and judges. (I shall have to deal with this canon at much greater length in Book 5.)

One last point. Alciato argues that sometimes all the people present at this meeting have vanished when the name of Jesus is pronounced. They were therefore imaginary people, not physical, because a physical object cannot vanish in this way. My reply is that the witches \[sagas\] who had been present at the meeting did not vanish, but that the eyes of the onlookers were blinded and \[the participants\] were taken away very rapidly by their evil spirits. This is how they are said to have \'vanished\'-in a broad sense and in the proper meaning of the word, \'they ceased to be seen\'. One must not hide \[the fact\] that Alciato genuinely thinks an evil spirit cannot move bodies from their place, because the result of that is his claim that Christ the Lord was not carried off by the Devil to the pinnacle of the Temple and the mountain-top. This he \'proves\' on the authority of Origen\'s thirty-first homily on Luke and St Jerome on Matthew. Philipp Camerarius was rash enough in chapter 72 of his Works of Occasional Hours to believe what Alciato said. Later on, however, I shall point out that very many more Fathers \[of the Church\] have held the opposite point of view. Certainly, St Jerome offers Alciato no support, and Origen is clearly opposed to him, because in putting his objection, Alciato crops the words he is citing and omits Origen\'s reply.

Experience raises an objection-that after the women have anointed themselves, sometimes they are not carried off but are found lying in the same spot in when they anointed themselves. \[Bartolomeo della\] Spina testifies to this in the case of one woman from Avila, and three or four \[others\], and other \[writers have done the same\] in relation to other cases. My reply, along with Spina in \[Inquiry into Night-Flying Witches\], chapters 30 and 31, is that there are various reasons for this, partly to do with God, partly to do with the evil spirit. In the case of the latter, when it is advantageous to him, he deceives the witches \[sagas\] by not moving them from the spot, so that in this way he can convince judges and princes that what people say about such transvections is not true, and thus hinder the execution of justice. He therefore renders the pact ineffective, because then he hopes the human race will suffer a greater calamity as a result. He also keeps the pact, (when God allows him to do so), in the hope of trapping more people this way. In God\'s case, if people\'s sins require it, He very often allows the Devil to keep the pacts he has made with magicians. Sometimes He prevents this-for example, when judges are moved by curiosity to make this kind of investigation-and the result is that the judges are confused about the punishment of the wrong-doing and, so to speak, blinded. Both happen perfectly properly, and for these same reasons the evil spirit sometimes wishes, (and God allows him), to move the women from where they are and to leave a likeness of them in their place, so that people may think they have stayed there and have not been taken away.
[Page 75]

A second opinion, then-and how very true I think it is!-is that \'an evil spirit sometimes transfers witches \[sagas\] from one place to another riding on a goat or some other creature\', (for the most part in their imagination, that is, the evil spirit fashions a body out of air, or even \[one\] in the shape of a human being, and puts it on, and sometimes he transports three or four women at the same time), \'or on a straw or even a broomstick, (although the evil spirit does the work and holds them up), and physically attend their wicked meeting\'.

This opinion is much more widely held among theologians and practising lawyers in Italy, Spain, and Germany, and there also are very many Catholic writers who support it: Albertus Magnus, (quoted by Thomas of Cantimpré, Book 2, chapter 57, part 19); \[Pedro\] Ciruelo, Superstition Part 2, chapter 1; William of Newburgh, whom I shall cite in a moment; \[Juan de\] Torquemada, whom I cited earlier; \[Paolo\] Grillando, Divinatory Magicians Book 2, question 7, no. 8, in which he says he has changed his opinion; \[Bernardus\] Basinus, Magical Practices, proposition 9; \[Nicholas\] Rémy, Worship of Evil Spirits Book 1, chapters 14, 24, and 29; the authors of The Hammer \[of Witches\] in more than one passage; \[Francisco\] Peña in \[Nicholas Eymeric\], A Directive for Inquisitors Part 2, comment 2, and others; Pietro Damiani letter 4, chapter 17. There are also more recent physicians such as \[Baudouin van\] Ronss, whom I shall cite in a moment; \[Giovanni Battista Codronchi\], Illnesses Caused by Poisonous Magic Book 2, chapter 8 and Book 3, chapter 8; \[Andrea\] Cesalpino, Investigation into Evil Spirits, chapter 20. A large number of theologians maintain this and discuss the subject very carefully: Johannes Dodus in his defence against Francisco Samuel; Guillaume d\'Auvergne, last part of The World, chapter 23; Silvestro \[da Prierio\] on the language used by heresy, no. 3; \[Alonso Tostado\], \[Commentary\] on Matthew, chapter 4, question 47; \[Jan de\] Beets, op.cit supra, chapter 4; \[Hugh de\] Saint-Victor, op.cit.supra; \[Tommaso\] Cajetan 2.2, question 95, article 3; Sixtus of Siena, Library Book 5, annotation 73; \[Pierre\] Crespet, The Hatred of Satan, discourse 15; Sébastien Michaëlis, Discourse of Spirits Book 1; \[José\] Anglés in \[Flowers of Theological Questions\], second single question on the practice of magic, article 4, difficulty 5; Peter Binsfeld at the end of the work cited earlier, conclusion 11;

\[Bartolomeo della\] Spina against Ponzinibio; and \[Lorenzo\] D\'Anania, The Character of Evil Spirits Book 4.

Didn\'t St Hippolytus the martyr also realise that such meetings would take place at the time of Antichrist, (The End of the World, not far from the start)? The Salic Laws were aware of them, as is clear from law 17, and according to Crespet who quotes him, the Calvinist Lambert Daneau writes that a regular meeting took place in Geneva near the cathedral. But listen to what Hippolytus says. \'At that time, that iniquitous individual, insolent in his arrogance, will gather together his evil spirits in human guise\'-don\'t they dance this way during their meetings, and have sex with the witches \[strigibus\]?-\'and he will despise those who have invited him to rule over them. He will also corrupt many souls and indeed will appoint princes for them from among his evil spirits\'.

His superior, the Devil, does this every day when he assigns his evil spirit as a little schoolmaster to each of the witches \[strigum\]. In the chapter about dreams in his book on the soul, \[chapter 46\], Tertullian declares that \'people\'s homes also lie open to evil spirits, and people are surrounded by mental images of them, not only in their chapels but also in their bedrooms\'. Observe now by what pact this secret rite of iniquity was already operating in times past, and I think one should refer to something William of Newburgh tells us. I quote, \'In Yorkshire, not far from where I was born, something extraordinary happened which I knew about from the time I was a child. Several miles away from the sea in the east there is a village, and next to it are the well-known waters commonly known as the \"Vipse\".
[Page 76]

A peasant from this village, who had gone to see a friend in the next village, was returning, somewhat less than sober, late at night and (listen to this!) he heard the sounds of people singing and having a good time \[which were coming\] from a nearby hillock. (I have seen this hillock quite often. It is two or three furlongs away from the village.) Astonished that anyone would be rupturing the silence in the dead of night with cheerful celebrations, he wanted to investigate more closely and noticed an opening in the side of the hillock. He went up to it, looked inside, and saw a big house, brightly lit, full of men and women who were sitting down to what looked like a formal dinner. One of the waiters noticed him standing in the doorway and offered him a cup.

He took it, but deliberately refrained from drinking, poured the contents away, but kept the cup, and left quickly. The removal of the cup caused an uproar at the party and the guests chased after him, but he escaped because of the speed of the mule he was riding and retreated to his village along with his remarkable plunder. In the end, this vessel, which \[was made\] of an unknown material and had a strange colour and unusual shape, was offered as a gift to the King of England, Henry the Elder, and then, after he had refused it, to the Queen\'s brother David, (namely, the King of Scots) and was kept for very many years as one of the treasures of Scotland. A few years ago, I am reliably informed, William, King of Scots, surrendered it to Henry II who wanted to see it\', \[History\] of English Affairs Book 1, chapter 38.

The common people usually call such secret spots in mountains \'the mount of Venus\', and they say there is also one of these in Italy, near Lake Nursia. (This is well-known from letter 46 by Enea Silvio.)²²⁴ Robert Gaguin, General of the Trinitarian Order, writes as follows in Book 10 of his history of the French. \'At that time, Guillaume Edelin, a learned theologian and Prior of St Germain-enLaye, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in Évreux for the crime of breaking his monastic vows. This distinguished man was in love with a woman and was unable to enjoy her companionship. So he invited an evil spirit to be his patron, and worshipped him under the guise of a ram. Later \[the spirit\] taught him how to pick up a besom and put it between his thighs, as though it were a horse. It would then take him instantaneously where he wanted \[to go\]\'.

Among the Avignon witches \[striges\], (as \[Sébastien\] Michaëlis tells us in his Discourse of Spirits, annotation 6), they arrested a boy who told the judges that his father has taken him to the \'synagogue\', (which is what they call their meeting), and that while he was there he had seen them carry out many wicked, dreadful things. In consequence, \[he said\], he was terrified and crossed himself and said Jesus, what is the meaning of this?\' As soon as he had said it, the entire mob disappeared, and he found he was alone in that place. Next day he came back to his home which was about three miles away from the \'synagogue\', and denounced his father to the judges, and this is why the boy\'s neighbours gave him the name \'masquillon\', that is, \'little sorcerer\' \[sortiarius\]. This boy was still a prisoner in Avignon when Michaëlis was writing his account in 1582.

Listen to another eye-witness \[account\] taken from \[Paolo\] Grillando whose words I am quite happy to write down. \'When this\', (that is, of course, homage), \'has been done, he,\' (the principal evil spirit), \'appoints an evil spirit to take custody of the woman, whom he must never leave, but serve her every wish; and whenever she happens to come to the theatricals, he will tell the woman this, bring her there, and give her instruction. Actually, this evil spirit keeps her company the way a husband does his wife. They often go to those assemblies, where a very large number of women get together, and they do not see the things I have mentioned mentally or intellectually or apparently.
[Page 77]

They come to the foresaid places in their real, natural person in the following manner and ordernamely, first of all, one or two days before the assembly takes place, \[the woman\] is informed by the evil spirit who has been given custody of the woman how to prepare herself at such and such a time to come to the show. If the woman were to have a good reason which prevented \[her attendance\], he takes her and, provided her reason is genuine, excusable, and one she can legitimately offer as an excuse, she is given a hearing. Otherwise, if she were to pretend to have a reason which was not a reason for non-attendance, she would not be taken there against her will, but would stay at home. Nevertheless, as punishment for her lie, the evil spirit would torture her so vigorously and distress her so powerfully in mind and body with very great, continual pains and sickness internal and external, that she would have no peace inwardly day or night but would always be suffering affliction.

Everything she might do would have no effect and would come to nothing as she did it, to the point where, to make all her sufferings cease, she would confess her fault and promise, even to the extent of swearing an oath, that she would not refuse any more to go \[to the meetings\]. Now, when she promised to go, the moment the night and hour arrived, a voice like that of a human would summon her. \[It came\] from the evil spirit himself, although they do not call him an evil spirit, but \'little teacher\'. (Some women \[call\] their teacher \"Martinet\" or \"Little Martin\".) she had been summoned this way, she would pick up a small box of ointment and smear certain parts and bits of her body with it. After doing this, she would leave the house and would always find her \"little teacher\" waiting for her at the door, in the form of a goat. The woman said she would mount on his back and cling hard with her hands on to his hair. The goat would immediately rise through the air and, in a very short time, carry her off to an almond-tree in Benevento where he would put her down gently\', etc. \[Question 7, no. 28\]. It is worth noting that the rest \[of the passage\] agrees with what the other scholars I cited have written usually takes place in a meeting. The theologians I have cited adduce various exemplary stories, and to do defendants\' confessions which all agree that the act of transporting, the way it is carried out, the ceremonies at the meeting, and other circumstances, are done physically.

At this point I shall pursue the most important of these \[points\] briefly and add some more which I heard from Pierre Dheure who is as dear to me as a brother and well-known for his erudition and integrity. He was present in his capacity as inquisitor and judge at the trial of wise women \[sagarum\] and vampire witches \[lamiarum\] in Stavelot in 1597 and 1598. As for the broomstick, Sébastien Michaëlis notes, (op. cit. annotation 7), that Abraham, son of Ezra interprets Leviticus chapter 19 as a prohibition of harmful magic \[maleficii\], as follows. \'You will not carry out experiments with drawings, sticks, things you have made, movements, days, and hours.\'

With these words he covered most of the ceremonies of witches \[strigum\]. By \'drawings\' he means the circle, (I have already dealt with this); by \'stick\' he means the wands they use for harmful magic, and others which \[they use\] for paßδopávtia \[rhabdomancy\], and the reed or the shaft of the besom on which they ride to go from one place to another. The Devil delights in the wand because he wants to imitate Moses\'s staff which effected miracles, or the other staff belonging to Aaron, which burst into flower. \[The women are accustomed to smear this stick with an ointment made from various kinds of most extraordinary things, the fat of slaughtered infants in particular, although sometimes they do not anoint the stick, but their legs or other parts of their body, as is clear from what \[Paolo\] Grillando says, and from the verdict of the court in Avignon, which I shall discuss in full in Book 5. It would be possible \[for them to go to a meeting\] without \[using\] the ointment, but in actual fact they apply it liberally, with the result that they kill as many infants as they can in the belief that without this fat they cannot be transported to their meeting. This is evidence that the first time they go, it is enough for them to borrow the ointment from others, but that on subsequent occasions the women have to prepare the ointment by killing a child.
[Page 78]

So, once they have anointed themselves this way, they are usually carried away sitting on a stick, a pitch-fork, or a distaff, or standing on one leg in a basket, or sitting on a besom, a reed, a bull, a pig, a male goat, or a dog. (Rémy furnishes examples of all these in Book 10, chapter 14). So this, I am saying, is how they are normally carried away to the meeting-\'the sport of good fellowship\', as they call it in Italy. There, on most occasions, they light a foul, dreadful fire and an evil spirit sits on a throne as president of the assembly. His appearance is terrifying, most often that of a male goat or a dog. \[The participants\] come forward to worship him, but not in the same way. Sometimes they supplicate him on bended knee; sometimes they stand with their back to him; sometimes they even throw their legs in the air and hold their head, not pointing forwards, but tilted right back so that their chin is pointing up at the sky.

They offer him candles made from pitch or a child\'s umbilical cord and kiss him on his backside as a sign of homage. (What do you think about that?) Sometimes, too, they imitate the sacrifice of the Mass, (the greatest of all their crimes), as well as purification with water and similar Catholic ceremonies. (I shall demonstrate this from Book 3 of the narrative of a learned man, the most distinguished senator Raymund). In addition to this, they offer their children to the Devil during the meeting, as the mother of Cuno della Rovere did some years ago, according to \[Peter\] Binsfeld, and, according to \[Nicolas\] Jacquier, chapter 7, another woman offered her three children in 1458.

But, according to the way they both interpret it, when they offer their own children, or those of others, to the evil spirit, and kill them, \[the women are performing, in a wicked and cruel fashion, an utterly foul sacrifice to the idol, Moloch; or they dedicate a great quantity of their very seed to him, as that extraordinarily wicked magician did when he mingled his seed with holy oil while having sex with a woman in church, a story told by Jacquier on folio 58 of his Scourge; or they receive the sacred Host during communion, keep it in their mouth, and then take it out and offer it to the evil spirit and trample it underfoot in front of him, as many witches \[striges\] confessed in answer to Jacquier\'s questions, (chapter 8).

Once they have committed these and similar atrocious and execrable abominations, they sit down at table and start to enjoy the food supplied by the evil spirit or which they have brought themselves. Sometimes they perform a vigorous dance before the meal, sometimes they do it afterwards. There is usually more than one table-three or four, in fact-loaded with food which is sometimes very dainty and sometimes tasteless and insipid. Each person has his or her place allotted according to station or wealth. Sometimes each person\'s evil spirit sits beside him or her; sometimes the workers of harmful magic \[malefici\] sit on one side of the table, and each person\'s evil spirit on the other. They do not fail to say a grace worthy of such a gathering, using words which are always openly blasphemous and in which Beelzebub himself is declared to be the creator, giver, and preserver of all things. (This information comes from a list of graces which they stick under the tables placed at their disposal.

I have read a copy of these formulae, written in the hand of a very famous worker of harmful magic \[malefici\]). Sometimes they take part in this feast without hiding their face. Sometimes they cover it with a mask, a linen cloth, or some other veil or mask. Usually they wear masks which look like human faces \[personati\]. After dinner, each evil spirit takes the pupil of whom he has charge by the hand and, in order to do everything with the most absurd kind of ritual, each person turns his or her back, joins hands in a circle, and tosses his or her head like a lunatic. Then they begin to dance. Sometimes they hold lighted candles with which they worship the evil spirit, exchanging kisses in his presence. They sing very obscene songs in his honour or jump up and down in time to a drum or pipe which is played by someone sitting in the fork of a tree. They behave ridiculously in every way, and in every way contrary to accepted custom. Then their demon-lovers copulate with them in a most repulsive fashion.
[Page 79]

When they sacrifice, they usually start with an act of adoration, but they often make sacrifices outwith the meeting. Thereupon, (they add), each person gives an account of the wicked deeds he or she has done since the last meeting. The more serious and detestable these are, the more fulsomely they are praised. But if they have done nothing, or if what they have done is not dreadful enough, an evil spirit or some older \[male\] worker of harmful magic \[maleficus\] gives them an appalling beating. Finally, they receive powders-which some writers say are the ashes of the he-goat whose shape had been taken by the evil spirit they worship, and which has suddenly been consumed by fire in front of their eyes-or they receive other poisonous substances, often with the highly esteemed decree to do harm to every individual, and the command of the evil spirit, their false god, hanging over their heads-Avenge yourselves, otherwise you will die, so that you may know there is a law which is the opposite of love\'. Each person then goes home. If they live nearby, they go on foot, but if they live further away, they retire the way they were brought. For the most part, the meetings begin either in the silence of midnight when the power of darkness is strong, or at midday which reminds us of the well-known verse of the Psalmist about the evil spirit of noon, \[Psalm 90.6\]. Abraham ben Ezra writes that magicians observe certain days and hours. Our witches \[striges\] seem to have different appointed days in different places. In Italy they gather on Friday night, (as \[Bernardo da\] Como says in his \[Inquisitors\'\] Lantern), at about midnight, (as Sébastien Michaëlis says in annotation 7.) In Lotharingia, on the other hand, they meet on Thursday and Saturday night, as Rémy says in Book 1, chapter 14. (I have read in other writers \[that they meet\] on Monday night.)

Their evil spirit could transport the women without using an ointment, as I have said, and sometimes he does, but for various reasons he prefers to use it. This is because sometimes the witches are too timid to make the venture or because they are too weak to bear the ghastly contact with Satan via the body he has assumed. Sometimes he stupefies their senses with the ointment and persuades these wretched people that its power is very great. On other occasions he mimics the holy sacraments instituted by God, and by these quasi-rituals imports a degree of reverence and veneration into his orgies. The ointment\'s power, however, adds nothing to the transportation and therefore it is obvious that even if those who wish, out of curiosity, to be present at a meeting at the appointed time anoint themselves and are actually transported through the air-something which, as has been proved on many occasions, God permits in order to punish their rash, self-indulgent curiosity-nevertheless, if someone is firm in the Faith and armed with charity were to anoint him or herself with this ointment with the intention of disproving and routing the evil spirit\'s deceptions, and confirming the true Faith, there can be no doubt, (as Binsfeld correctly says), that no transportation would follow.

The reason is that this individual renders every pact with an evil spirit null and void, and God would not allow him or her to make one. Moreover, when witches \[sagae\] anoint themselves out with the appointed time of a meeting, they do not fly away and are not carried off, because this is not part of the pact. They know this and therefore do not anoint themselves unless they hear the signal for a meeting. According to \[Bartolomeo della\] Spina, chapter 30, sometimes they are given notice of a meeting by their \'little Martin\', sometimes by the voices of the witches\' \[sagarum\] queen and her entourage as they fly past, sometimes in another way. But there are certain workers of harmful magic \[malefici\] who are carried elsewhere whenever they want at a particular signal specified in their pact-the ointment, the way they are wearing their hat or cloak, or something else. What I said earlier about this, however, is their more usual practice.
[Page 80]

There is proof that this transportation is done physically, primarily because nothing can be said which makes it impossible. What is missing? Not a moving body. The Devil assumes the body at once. There is no resistance from the body which is moved, and its weight does not stand in the way because the power of the evil spirit which is moving it is far greater. He could move mountains from their place. The speed of movement to a far-off place in a short space of time does not stand in the way, either, because the speed and power of an angel\'s nature can make this happen, as St Augustine and St Thomas \[Aquinas\] say. Nor does God not permit it, because there are almost countless examples of His having given permission, as is perfectly clear from Holy Scripture.

The first passage some people \[adduce\] says that Christ our Lord allowed Himself to be carried off by an evil spirit on two occasions, and that this was done by a wicked spirit \[malo spiritu\] is accepted by Origen, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Augustine, Gregory, Strabo, and others. I am not making use of this example because, although many Fathers \[of the Church\] declare that Christ was seized and carried off by an evil spirit and flew through the air, a batter interpretation-as Origen and Euthymius point out-is that Christ was simply guided. The Devil went past and Christ followed, and this is how He came to the pinnacle \[of the Temple\] and to the top of the mountain. St Luke clearly intimates this, and St Matthew does not present an obstacle, because not infrequently means \'to take up\' simply by taking the lead.

Learned men also interpret it this way in this passage, so this example does not have a great deal of force. It is common for a second passage to be adduced: that evil spirits entered a herd of pigs and drove them headlong into the sea. There is a still weightier passage which they adduce as a third example-I mean Philip the Deacon who was brought by the Spirit from the desert to Ashdod, and \[there is also\] Habakkuk who was fetched by his hair to Daniel in Babylon. Ulrich Molitor\'s reply to these passages is that we are offering a faulty proof in going from good angels to evils spirits, because the power and strength of angels in this matter is far greater than that of evil spirits. This answer is full of faults because there is no reason for us to say that a good angel can do more than a bad one by local motion, and the general consensus of theologians concedes that devils have retained the properties with which they were endowed and have lost those with which they were graced. So even though it was a good angel who carried Habakkuk, with God\'s permission a devil will be able to transport a human being. Why is it astonishing that evil spirits receive power from God over human bodies when they have received the far greater \[power\] of deceiving the soul?

One\'s experience of so many examples also provides proof of it, with the result that no one, without being wantonly impudent, can disagree. The most venerable and most holy Fathers \[of the Church\] say that Simon the magician was lifted up into the air, ferried on the wings of evil spirits, and appeared to flit about in front of Peter\'s eyes. One reads similar things about Abaris the Scythian.

The History of the English tells us that Bladud, King of Britain, was a match for anyone in his skill in flying, but that he also had a more unfortunate death than anyone else. Johannes Magnus, historiographer of the Goths and Swedes, relates of Eric, King of the Swedes, that he would immediately be transported in the direction in which he turned his hat. In his Chronicle, Guillaume de Nangis recorded that Berengar, a heretic and a magician, was in Rome and sang the lesson \[of the day\] in a church in Tours on the same night and, speaking about portents, he tells us that in England, in 1045, a female worker of poisonous magic \[veneficam\] was publicly put on a black horse by an evil spirit and carried through the air. (In the next Book, I shall give an example similar to this about the Comte de Mâcon, by the venerable Peter, Abbot of Cluny.)²³⁶ At the end of Book 11 of \[A Discussion of Miracles, Caesarius \[of Heisterbach tells us about an elderly woman leaping out of a cauldron, and in his Chronicle of Flanders, \[Jacob de\] Meyer deals with works of harmful magic \[maleficiis\] carried out in Artois in 1459. Vincent \[de Beauvais\], quoting Peter Damian, tells us about the five-year old child of a man from a very noble family. This boy became a monk and after being carried off one night was found next morning in a locked-up mill. In answer to questions, he said that certain people had taken him to a great feast, urged him to eat, and afterwards thrown him into the mill from a height.

In Book 2, question 7 of his Divinatory Magicians, Paolo Grillando relates that in 1524 a woman called Lucrezia was brought before him in his capacity as inquisitor. While she was being taken home from a witches\' meeting \[congregatione ludorum\] immediately after dawn, she heard the bell being rung to call the people to morning prayer, and all of a sudden, the evil spirit who was carrying her abandoned her in a field full of thorns. By chance a young man she knew was passing through \[the field\] and the wretched woman call to him by his name. The young man, seeing she was completely naked, was afraid to approach unless she covered her private parts with her thighs and unbound hair. She kept on coaxing him gently and finally he came near her and asked how she was feeling and why she was there. At first, she hid all the other details and told him a lot of lies until the young man did not believe her and said he would not help her unless she told him the truth. She made him promise to keep it secret and \[then\] confessed what had happened to her and why it had happened. The young man took her home and she showered him with presents, but in the end, forgetting he had given his word \[to keep quiet\], he told the story to one person and then to another and so, little by little, the story leaked out. The woman was arrested, and the young man forced to provide evidence of the truth. (All this is what Grillando tells us.)

He adds another \[exemplary story\] which is as follows. A woman from the diocese of Sabina used to profess this devilish craft, and because her husband had his suspicions about it, he questioned her on several occasions, but she always denied \[any knowledge of it\]. Her husband, however, continued to be suspicious and anxiously kept on pressing her for the truth. He acted in such a cunning way that one night he saw her smearing herself with an ointment. Once she had done this, he saw her leaving very quickly, like a bird, swooping down from the upper storey of the house to the lower. Her husband followed her in order to see where she was going, \[but then\] he saw her no longer, and when he came to the front door of the house, he found it closed. This caused him great astonishment. The next day, however, the husband questioned his wife again about what he was anxious to know, and she, (as one might expect), kept on saying she had no idea \[what he was talking about\]. But so that the woman would not be able to deny things any more, her husband told her plainly everything he had seen her do the previous night and then gave her a good beating with his cudgel, threatening to beat her harder if she did not tell the truth. But he did promise to forgive her if she told him everything.

So, the woman understood she could not keep her secret any longer, told her husband the truth frankly, and asked his forgiveness, which her husband granted on condition she take him to gatherings of this kind. In order to make sure of his forgiveness, she readily promised what he asked, and fulfilled her promise with Satan\'s permission. So, she took her husband to the place where the entertainments \[ludi\] were taking place. He had a good look at the sport, the dances, and everything else, and finally sat down at table with everyone else to eat. He thought the food was tasteless and asked for salt. There was none on the table and although he asked for it again and again, he was never given any. Finally, after he persisted in asking and had waited for a very long time, he was given salt, at which he said, \'Now praise be to God the salt has arrived!\' When he said these words, the evil spirits, who run away when they hear God being praised, made an immediate retreat. Everyone else disappeared, the lamps were extinguished, and he stayed there, alone and naked, until dawn broke and he saw some shepherds.
[Page 82]

He asked them the name of the district in which he was, and they replied, \'the countryside of Benevento in the Kingdom of Naples\'. This was a hundred miles away from where the man lived and in consequence, even though he was rich, he was forced to beg along the road so that he could get back to his own home. The moment he arrived he accused his wife of being a vampire-witch \[lamiae\], and related everything that had happened, (the way it has been told here), to the judges and they, upon investigating the whole business thoroughly, as was proper, found that everything I have been saying was true, and the woman\'s confession confirmed it.

The foregoing comes from Grillando. The Franciscan Alfonso a Castro, in his chapter 16, adds that he can give an account of many other pieces of evidence which he had come to know, from entirely trustworthy witnesses, \[referred to events which\] had taken place in Spain. Bartolomeo della Spina, Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace, gives us examples which are no less reliable in chapter 17 ff. of his \[Inquiry into\] Night-Flying Witches, and I shall write down one of them. \'A young woman\', he says, \'who was living with her mother in Bergamo, was found one night in Venice in the bedroom of a kinsman. She was discovered naked in the morning and was recognised because she was his cousin. When they asked her how she had come there, or what she was doing there and why, she started to wail, and after they got her dressed, she suddenly told them the following story. \"Last night, I was lying awake in bed and saw my mother, who thought I was asleep, get out of bed, pull of her underwear, and smear her body with an ointment she took out of a little pot she removed from underneath some bricks.

Then she took a stick she had ready there, climbed on it the way one mounts a horse, and was carried away out of the window, and after that I did not see her at all. Then I got out of bed, too, and anointed my body the way I had seen my mother do and was carried away out of the window. I was immediately brought here where I saw my mother waiting in ambush for a boy who was lying in the bed. I was frightened when I saw that my mother was also startled by my arrival and was threatening to attack me, so I invoked the name of the Lord Jesus and the Blessed Virgin, and after that I did not see my mother and was left there, naked and alone\". Once the girl had told her story, her cousin wrote down everything she had said for the Father Inquisitor in Bergamo.

\[The Inquisitor\] arrested the woman and when she was put to the torture, she confessed everything and added that she had been carried off by her evil spirit more than fifty times so that she could kill the foresaid cousin\'s child, but that she never been successful because his parents always protected him well with the sign of the cross and holy prayers\'. \[Bartolomeo\] also adds another example, and I shall write this one down, too. \'One Antonio Leo, a coal-miner from Ferrara \[a Montagna\] in Valtellina, told me this year that he had found out the things written below from someone in his home district, to whom they had actually happened. Because of what many people told him, this man became suspicious that his wife was going on a \"voyage\", (that is, to a meeting of witches \[sagarum\]), \'while he was asleep at night. One night he pretended to be fast asleep and observed his wife get out of bed, anoint herself with ointment from a small pot she had kept hidden, and straight away she was nowhere to be seen. Her husband was stunned and, drawn by curiosity, got out of bed and did the same as his wife. Immediately, (so it seemed to him), he was carried off up the chimney-which was how, (he thought), his wife had also risen upwards-and was brought to the wine-cellar of a noble Count.There he found his wife along with several other people. When she saw him, his wife immediately made a sign and she and the others left, leaving her husband in that place. He was found by the house-servants next morning and, amid uproar, arrested as a thief and brought before the Count. He was given time to speak and gave a vigorous account of what had happened, as a result of which his wife was arraigned before the inquisitor and at length confessed and paid the appropriate penalty for her crimes.\'
[Page 83]

This is what Bartolomeo della Spina tells us. Still better witnesses are three examples of witch-transportation Nicholas Rémy adds to these three Italian ones in his Worship of Evil Spirits Book 1, chapter 14, of which I cannot deprive the reader. This is what he writes. \'In May 1589, villagers were celebrating a rural festival in Luz, which is a village not without a certain reputation in the foothills of the Vosges. Claude Choteau was coming back from this village at nightfall to a neighbouring village called Wisembach and had already climbed up a good part of the hill which rises between the two villages when he was battered by a sudden whirlwind. Astonished, he stood still and looked around \[to see if there was any reason anywhere for such an uncommon occurrence, since the air was perfectly calm and still everywhere else. He noticed six masked women in a retired spot-the locals call it the Morèle cleft. They were dancing round a table set with a lot of gold and silver, throwing their heads all over the place as they did so and \[acting like\] people who are driven hither and thither by fits of madness.

There was also a man on a black bull, standing near them. He was looking at them as though he were someone in the street with nothing else to do. In the meantime, \[Claude\] stood where he was while he recovered himself and looked at the whole scene more closely. While he was doing this, the entire mob disappeared in an instant, as if it withdrew from his sight. So, his fear left him, and he resumed his journey. He had already got over the summit of the hill when would you believe it!-those women started following him closely behind, throwing their heads about as before and preserving a deep or agreed silence. A man with a coal-black face was walking ahead of them. His hands were curved, like grappling-hooks, and he was preparing to let them loose on \[Claude\'s\] face, had not \[Claude\] not drawn his sword and thwarted him. But because he did so, \[the man\] stopped taunting him and, as though in fear of his life, vanished.

Nevertheless, the women made another appearance and the man who, as I said, was seated on a bull and was watching their dances, was with them. Choteau, who had now become more confident, came closer to him and said, \"Oh, there you are, Didier Gaxet!\"-that being the man\'s name-Please, protect me if you can. Honestly, I give you my solemn word I\'ll not say anything at all about what I have seen\". Hardly had he finished speaking when a whirlwind or cloud swept round him again, and when at last he spun himself round and freed himself from it, he found he was alone on the ground in a place a long way away from the path. But, by retracing his steps to where he had last been on it, he stumbled on to it and took himself back home as fast as he could.

Three days after giving this testimony, he was summoned before the investigating judge again and added the following to the very large number of details he had given earlier. He remembered, (he said), that when he had gone closer to the table to see what kind of a banquet has been set out on it, an evil spirit had immediately flown at his face with his nails, and while he was engaged in defending himself with his sword, he had been lifted up once again by a rather violent wind and carried off to the Combrimons Falls, a spot not less than two hundred paces away.

Lest anyone think this was perhaps the raving of a drunk frightened by the loneliness of the night and the place, in Sandeodat, on 22nd May, 1589, one of those women, Barbelline Caxet, had also said the same thing to the investigating \[judge\] a month earlier in almost the same words, adding that Desiré Gaxet and his wife had given Choteau two measures of wheat and two cows\' milk cheeses to keep his mouth shut about what he had seen. Consequently, when the two of them were brought face to face, they agreed in every particular except one which was that Barbelline said the evil spirit had not tried to lay hands on Choteau because he had gone near the table-this was a lie he had told during his statement-but because he had been on the point of stealing a gold cup from it\'.
[Page 84]

Rémy gives another example of the same thing. \'Johann von Hembach had scarcely ceased being a youngster when his mother, a worker of poisonous magic \[venefica\], took him with her to nocturnal meetings of evil spirits and, on the grounds that he knew how to play the pipes, told him to play them and to climb a tree close by so that he could be heard more clearly. He did so and, being free to have a good look at their jumping and dancing, was astonished at their noveltyeverything there was so preposterous and ridiculous-and casually said, \"Good God, where has this silly, stupid mob come from?\" Scarcely had he said this than he fell to the ground and hurt one of his shoulders. He begged those who were standing near him to help him but found himself alone.

He talked about this quite openly, and people had different opinions about it-some maintained it was a vision, others that it had actually taken place. But them something happened which removed people\'s doubts, because one of the women who had taken part in the dancing, Catherine Prevost, was arrested not long afterwards in Freissen on 2nd September 1589 on suspicion of casting lots for divination \[sortilegii\]. She gave an account of the whole business as written above without being interrogated first, unaware of the version Von Hembach had already propagated. Otilla Kervers and Agnes Eisarbz, who were sentenced for \[practising\] poisonous magic \[veneficii\] the following year-Kervers in Werderst on 6th and 7th August 1590 and Eisarbz in Dieuze on 3rd November 1590-each in turn made the same declaration and in addition made it evidentially stronger by giving the name, (Mayebuch), of the place where it happened\'.

The third \[example\] is not only a clear piece of testimony, but also makes as clear as daylight what had happened. It goes as follows. \'Nicole Lagbernhard was coming back from the mill in Guermange to Assenoncourt on 25th July 1590 and was making her way, at full noon, next to a hedge which was part of a wood, when she noticed men and women dancing in a circle and jumping about in the neighbouring ploughed field. But because they were doing so with their backs turned to each other, contrary to the usual way other people did it, she took a closer look and saw that, in addition to this, there were, mixed with those who were dancing and jumping in the circle, some who were deformed because they had the feet of goats and oxen. Almost dead with fear, she began to invoke the saving name of Jesus, (as people do when something unlucky and inauspicious threatens them), and to ask Him humbly that it might be possible for her to return home safe and sound. At that, all the dancers seemed to vanish, except for one called Petter Gross-Petter who was borne quickly into the air. But a small brush, such as bakers usually use to clean their oven before they put their bread in it, was seen to escape \[his grasp\] and fall; and while this was going on, Nichole, too, was swept up by a rather strong wind, started panting and puffing, and could scarcely draw breath, and when she got home she lay in bed, ill, for three whole days.

She and her neighbours talked about this, and the news spread through the whole district. At the first opportunity, the Petter I mentioned rather hot-headedly brought an action before a judge, so that he might not seem to be acknowledging and confessing to such a great crime by keeping quiet about it. In the end, however, he made up his mind to abandon \[his action\] because he was afraid that, since he was having no success with his case, he would be creating greater danger for himself. So, after due reflection, he abandoned it. This increased the suspicion against him even more, and many people considered it was because he had a bad conscience that he was \[now\] taking no notice of a wrong of which he had at first been so acutely aware.
[Page 85]

So, the judge investigated his life and behaviour the more carefully, and when he discovered, by means of reliable tokens of proof, that the case \[against Petter\] was not without grounds, he arrested him and prevailed on him to co-operate and confess his crime and, in the end, to expose and convict the others who had taken part in the crime with him. Among them were Barbelline, wife of Jean Latome \[who was tried\] at Dieuze on 27th January 1591 and Mayette, wife of Laurent Grosmaire, likewise \[tried\] at Dieuze on 16th February 1591. They acknowledged, separately but in the same words, that the information their accomplice Petter had disclosed about the Sabbat, when they danced back-toback along with cloven-footed individuals in their midst, was true.

On 1st March, 1591, a third person, Jean Michel, a herdsman from Dieuze, agreed with \[what\] these women \[had said in their\] confession, and added that while all this was taking place he was doing the job of pipe-player by putting to his mouth a sheep-hook someone happened to offer him, and letting his fingers flutter over it, as though he were playing notes on real pipes. When Nicole, (as has been said), full of fear, called upon Jesus and made the sign of the cross, he fell headlong from the rather high branch of the oak-tree on which he was sitting. Then he was caught up in a whirlwind and carried off to a meadow called \"Weiller\" where, not long before, he had left his flock grazing.

But in the end, the weightiest and most powerful piece of evidence relating to this incident was that the day after Nichole had told \[people about it\], the place where they had been dancing in a circle appeared to have been trodden down in a ring-the kind horse-trainers have to exercise their horses in a circuit. It was also chequered with recent traces of hooves belong to goats and oxen, and these remained visible until the field was brought under the plough and furrowed the following winter. Verbal evidence was given by Nicel Klein, Didier Vernex, and Gaspar Schneider, and they were all brought quickly to court and questioned about it by the judge.\'

Isn\'t this clearly sufficient proof of dances, meetings, and transportation from one place to another? At this point, will our sleepy-heads who deny everything say that these dreams have connected such different people in such an apposite fashion, like rings \[joined together\] into a single chain? Was Petter\'s brush also dreaming it had fallen down? Was Nicole dreaming and stuck in her bed for three days by the soporific anxiety of a dream? Did all those witnesses dream the ceremonies, and were the foot-marks so indelibly imprinted on the field by the power of unadulterated imagination? Had Apollo brought the flocks there from the \[River\] Amphrysus, or Hercules the Erythraean oxen from Cadiz, and did the cattle dance with practised skill on the soil of Lotharingia? Will over-nice people, (that is, the bothered-and-bewildered) go on being afraid that \'innocents\' of this kind claim they have committed offences which they never have done, but think they have because they\'ve got the wrong idea? Why this is so, and how stubborn is the desire of the human race to protect its enemies \[I shall discuss\] at much greater length in Book 5.

No less confirmatory is another \[example\] from Baudouin van Ronss\'s Letters on Medicine, \[chapter\] 50 which tells us something which had happened in Holland in his own day.²⁴² \'In the village of Oostbroek, not far from Utrecht, there was a widow who had taken in a male servant because her situation demanded she get help with her household expenses. Quite often, in the dead of night, as soon as the house-servants had gone to bed, he would look through the lattice \[over his window\] in the usual nosy way servants have, and see his mistress come into the stable, make her way to a specific, pre-arranged spot, and then stretch out her hands and grasp hold of the hay trough next to the horse\'s stall. Wondering what on earth she meant by this behaviour, he decided to try doing the same thing at the same time, without his mistress\'s knowledge.
[Page 86]

So, on the spur of the moment when his mistress came and did what she usually did and seemed to have gone away, he followed quickly, took a good look at the spot and then, imitating his mistress\'s example, threw his arms round the hay trough. Immediately he was snatched up into the air and carried off to the town of Wyck, to a cavern hidden underground, where he found a company of female workers of harmful magic \[maleficarum\] talking to each other about the acts of harmful magic \[maleficiis\] they had done. His mistress and her companions were astonished at her servant\'s unexpected appearance, and she asked him what trick he had used to get there in an instant, and why he had done so.

He told her, step by step, how he had done it and she immediately began to turn incandescent with rage, afraid that the result would be that those clandestine meetings at night would be brought to an end. So, she decided to talk to her partners in crime and \[ask them\] what they thought should be done in this awkward situation. Finally, they agreed among themselves to be friendly and make an exception of him, but that they would make him promise and swear an oath to remain silent and not communicate or reveal to anyone the secrets which he-beyond his merit or comprehension-might happen to see. He, for his part, made no such promise, but spoke to them in soothing tones and, with a view to getting them to behave with greater mildness, pretended that all his desires were fixed on one thing-that they would be gracious enough at some future date to let him attend their \"witches\' guild\" \[sortilegiarum collegio\].

In the meantime, while they were discussing this, the minutes glided by, and it was time to go. Once again, his mistress stirred up uncertainty about whether he should be sent home, which would be dangerous for the whole assembly, or killed for the general good. In the end they all agreed to choose the more merciful of the two and decided to send him back once they had bound him by an oath \[of silence\]. His mistress undertook this task and promised that, once he had given his word, she would take him home on her shoulders. They got themselves ready and were \[then\] carried swiftly through the air by a wind from the east. But now, listen to this! They had covered a good part of their journey when there came into view a lake covered with a jungle of reeds. This provided the maleficent old woman with an opportunity and, fearful lest the youth repent of his (pretended) initiation into their ghastly festivals, she saw a way of getting rid of him. She shot forward suddenly and threw him off her back, hoping, one must suspect, that the violence of the fall would kill him and that he would be swallowed up on the depths of the lake. But how very merciful is God, who does not seek the death of a sinner, but rather that he be converted and live, because God put a stop to the madwoman\'s

intention and did not allow the innocent youth to be drowned. Indeed, He gave the young man the considerably fairer boon of living right up to the present day. You see, as chance and good luck would have it, he did not receive a fatal blow when he fell into the lake, and the violent impetus of his descent was somehow broken by the reeds. It was starting to become light. The poor wretch\'s body was tortured by a thousand agonising pains, and the only part of it which worked was his tongue. So, he kept on groaning and gasping for a long time until some huntsmen who were passing gathered round him, extremely surprised by the unexpected sound of wailing, and found a man who had dislocated both his hips. They asked where he had come from, and what kind of misfortune had happened to him, and he told them everything, just as it had happened. He was brought back in a carriage to Utrecht where the noble Johan van Culemborg, the city magistrate, struck with consternation and full of astonishment because of the strangeness of what had happened to the man, subjected the details \[of his story\] to close examination and then ordered his men to hunt down the lady with the evil eye \[fascinatrix era\], arrest her, and put her in chains; and the moment she came into the magistrate\'s hands, she confessed everything\', etc.
[Page 87]

That is what \[Van Ronss\] says. What can the shameless mouth of Weyer, or Gödelmann, along with their oracles Luther and Melanchthon say to that? Will they say that because the silly woman was suffering from an excess of black bile, she believed it and was deceived? What \[can one say\]? How was the young man himself mangled this way and how did he get his dislocated hip? Did black bile suddenly dislocate it? Perhaps he made it up. Well, if that is so, how did he get to the reed-bed if not from the cavern mentioned in the story, and how did he get to the cavern if not from the house? If he didn\'t move from the house, how did he get from Oostbroek to the reed-bed? If he went of his own accord, where did such a serious and complete dislocation of limbs happen to him? Did people suffering from an excess of black bile find the young man there and bring him to the magistrate in Utrecht?

What shameless obstinacy! Reflect rather, Reader, on what this narrative tells us: (i) that there is a novel way of signalling \[to the evil spirit\], which is to seize hold of a hay trough instead of anointing oneself; (ii) that evil spirits usually choose particular places for themselves to hold their meetings and maleficent little assemblies. (Last year, for example, Jean del Vaulx, who was beheaded in Stavelot, was saying that one of the principal places in which they held their general congregations was within the jurisdiction of Utrecht, and that he had been taken there more than once from Stavelot;) (iii) that-take note of this!-not only are these female workers of harmful magic \[maleficas\] carried through the air, but with the assistance of an evil spirit they can carry others on their shoulders; and (iv) that it is the height of stupidity to commit oneself to be merciful to their very cruel, venomous women. How much safer it would have been for this young man to protect himself with the saving name of Jesus, or to have crossed himself and made that whole assemblage take to its heels as though he were blowing it away! To be sure, he would have remained alone in the cavern and would have had to endure the discomfort of a rather long journey on foot. (I could add many examples of this kind, because there are many of them in \[Giovanni\] D\'Anania, op.cit. Book 4; the author of The Madness of Evil Spirits Book 2, chapter 4; \[Antonio de\] Torquemada, dialogue 3; \[Peter\] Binsfeld, op.cit. Part 1, conclusion 12; Andreas Libavius in \'witches\' transportation\'; \[Bernardo da\] Como, The Inquisitors\' Lantern; and (older than these), Johannes Caesarius \[of Heisterbach\], A Discussion of Miracles Book 10, chapter 1; and others.)

One derives very strong proof from these examples. Since those who anointed themselves out of mere curiosity really were carried from one place to another which was so remote, it must be clear that this does not happen merely in the unadorned imagination and madness of silly women. Indeed sometimes, after a meeting has suddenly been dissolved, people have found tables and silverware and, later on, things their owners do not recognise; and their wives have confessed that they brought them with them to the meeting. Secondly, casters of lots \[sortiarii\] make careful note of all the places and all the things they eat and every place in the neighbourhood; they discern trees, hedges, rivers, fields, and houses; they recognise their fellow-guests, provided they are not wearing masks \[non larvati\], and they also often greet and have a conversation with those they meet on the way. Not infrequently, Catholic men and others of sound mind notice them going to or coming back from a meeting. Sometimes they are seen to be naked and arrested without their clothes on, either when they fall out of a whirlwind or a cloud, or when they have been wounded or maimed somewhere on their body. (See further Book 5).
[Page 88]

Likewise, they are often so tired out by their transvection that when they come back home, they take to their bed for three whole days before they can stand on their feet again, as Rémy tells us, op.cit. Book 1, chapter 24. They all say the same thing in their confessions and do not differ in the slightest detail. Others who do not share their crime and error confirm this. The condemned confess it at the stake itself, when pretence is of no avail and tortures have already been brought to an end. But when it comes to things which are worthless and delusive, there cannot be a conclusive proof which is so constantly one and the same, and unanimously agreed by everyone, and such great unanimity among people who are very different (and so numerous) in respect of the places \[they come from\], their circumstances, their ages, and their zeal. This is because the way the mind works is peculiar to the individual, and one person\'s imagination operates differently from that of someone else. The way the brain or the imagination is arranged-which would be necessary for an evil spirit \[to concoct\] this kind of image-is not the same, and there could not be such a great conformity in the telling of lies, and in my opinion this argument is sufficient to convince someone who is not obstinate.

This argument is confirmed because in op.cit. supra, no. 3 \[Bernardo da\] Como says, (and he says it well), that such dreams and fantasies are not in someone\'s power to the extent that he can make them happen or not happen as he pleases. But once witches \[strigibus\] have been converted in earnest and do not want to be present at a meeting any more, nothing more of the kind happens any further, simply because they do not want it \[to happen\]. This is clear proof that these things do not happen in dreams. Moreover, those who maintain that these things are dreams and wanton delusions undoubtedly sin against the reverence they owe to Mother Church, because the Catholic Church does not punish crimes unless they are proven and obvious. Nor does she consider people heretics unless they have clearly been arrested for heresy, (canon \'Consuluisti\', question 5.) For a good many years, however, she has regarded witches \[striges\] as heretics and, via inquisitors, order that they be punished and handed over to the secular arm, as is clear from books by \[Jakob\] Sprenger, \[Johannes\] Nider, \[Nicolas\] Jacquier, and \[Sébastien\] Michaëlis, and as experience tells us. Therefore, either the Church is in error, or the sceptics are, and anyone who says the Church is in error in a matter pertaining to the Faith must be entirely excommunicate.

\[Bernard da\] Como tells us the same exemplary story when he makes clear the truth of a denunciation. Unbelievers may put it to the test. \'Almost fifty years ago now, in Mendrisio\', he says, \'a town which was right next to Como, an inquisitor by the name of Master Bartolommeo de Homate, an official called Signior Lorenzo de Concorezio, and a notary, Giovanni de Fossato, were proceeding against these witches \[striges\]. One day the official, drawn by curiosity and wanting to test whether witches \[strigae\] would really go to their \"play\" physically, arranged a meeting \[with one of them\] and on a Wednesday came, with his notary and someone else, to a certain spot outwith the town, just as he had told the witch \[strigae\] in advance.

When the three men were almost there, they saw several people gathered together in the presence of someone-the Devil in the form of a goat-who was sitting in the manner of a great lord and, do you know, suddenly, at the Devil\'s command-and God permitted this because of the men\'s inquisitiveness-all the people in that gathering struck the official and his companions with sticks so hard that within fifteen days the official, the notary, and the third man died from the beating they had received. This is what he says. So should I have failed to persuade stubborn people to test what I have said, I shall not croak a warning against something which is very well known to everyone. You don\'t believe? Come and see.
[Page 89]

When they keep on saying that an evil spirit has no reason to do these things with individuals any more than he has to arrange the attendance of large numbers at his meetings, this is not true. He sees many advantages \[in doing it for the individual\]. (i) Through this association and the participation of more than one person, they are encouraged and more powerfully inured to evil-doing. (ii) The sins of individuals are made worse by this pact and people\'s participation in crime. (iii) By means of such enticements and the various initiations which take place there, they entangle more people more easily. (iv) A large crowd makes people more audacious when it comes to evil. It removes the fear of God from them and when they imitate one another, they are inflamed \[to commit\] greater offences, just as coals usually \[catch fire more easily\] when they have had oil poured over them. (v) The more people come to know criminal pleasure, the greater \[the pleasure\] seems to be. (vi) It is more difficult to convert people after they have delivered themselves to an evil spirit in front of several witnesses, and when the frequency of their actions has made them, so to speak, callous by habituation. (This is \[Bartolommeo della\] Spina\'s considered opinion in his Inquiry into Witches, chapter 20.)

In brief, therefore, I conclude that these transvections we are investigating can take place in four ways: (i) by mere thought, which Holy Scripture calls \'being carried in the spirit. Such was Ezechiel\'s vision. \'The likeness of a hand stretched out and took hold of me by a lock of hair on my head. The spirit \[spiritus\] lifted me up between the earth and the sky and brought me to Jerusalem in the sight of God\', \[8.3\]. The final phrase tells us how to interpret the words which precede it, lest we think this transvection is like that which happened to Habakkuk, about which \[the Book of\] Daniel tells us. (ii) Sometimes they make their way to meetings on foot, as \[Nicholas\] Rémy and \[Peter\] Binsfeld tell us. (iii) They are actually physically transported by an evil spirit by local motion, as I have said. (iv) Sometimes it can happen that they do not know whether they have been transported physically or merely thought \[that that is what happened\], such as in St Paul\'s case when he was snatched away one day, \[2 Corinthians 12.2\].

I find it recorded in certain of Fr. Juan de Maldonado\'s writings on evil spirits (a) that when \[witches\] want to be transported physically, they anoint themselves with an ointment made from baby\'s body-fat; (b) when they want to be present at meetings simply in dreams, they lie on their left side; (c) but when they prefer to stay awake and see whatever is happening at a meeting, as though it were being done in front of them, with the assistance of an evil spirit they spew a thick vapour out of their mouth, and in this they can look at images of what is being done, as though \[they were looking\] in a mirror. Perhaps the notorious Jean del Vaulx I mentioned meant to intimate this to his investigators when he said he knew how to tell whether he was taking part in a meeting physically or in imagination.

There is one thing left to be resolved which I know certain people have sometimes distorted. A rather learned natural philosopher and theologian asks how it can happen that, since an angel is incorporeal, he can move a physical object from its place. My reply is that he does not need God to assign him new power for this purpose, (which was Guillaume d\'Auvergne\'s idea): he does not need a distinct motive energy or power, (as \[Pierre\] Auriol thought): and an angel cannot, by will and intellect alone, without limits and without bounds move from its place any object he may wish, whenever he may wish, to wherever he may wish, and however fast he may wish. (One ought to be aware that an article of Paris condemned this and quite rightly so, because this implies unbounded power).
[Page 90]

But I reply that an angel can usually move and transfer a mass whose limits are fixed and known to him, and which is not too large for his power, with that speed and traction the angel\'s nimbleness and the natural constitution of the moved object permits, supposing he is present substantially in the object he has picked up-I prefer to follow those who have this idea-and, being present this way, pushes the object forward by means of his will alone and, by means of that same will, and using the object as his medium, moves another object next to it, or carries it in more or less the way a strong wind drives a feather through the air and finally sets it down in a particular place and thus it comes to a halt. This is how the angel carried the prophet Habakkuk simply by touching his hair. The hair did not support the body. This was done by the angel\'s power which was applied to the whole body through the authority of the angel\'s will.

Consequently, if an angel wants to moderate something he is doing, such as the speed of the transvection, he does not overwhelm the strength of what he is carrying. He makes sure the transvection of the human being is done without tiring \[the human\], and if he is unwilling to do this, the human must undoubtedly be extraordinarily tired out by the speed of his carriage through the air. Hence we understand that the diversity \[of experience\] which Rémy mentioned is not pre-determined, because transvections done by good angels are gentle and human beings are not distressed by them, whereas those done by bad \[angels\] are full of weariness, dread, and distress; and even though I believe this is what actually happens in the majority of cases, it can also happen that, if the evil spirit wishes, he can also convey \[human beings\] without fatiguing and vexing them. This is clear from the examples given by \[Antonio de\] Torquemada in his third dialogue, and Jean del Vaulx from Stavelot whom I mentioned said as much in his testimony about his own transvections. What is undoubtedly true is that these transvections by evil spirits are always full of danger and always cause fear.

Book 2, Question 17

Can an evil spirit change the size of bodies in such a way that he will be able to penetrate their various parts: and can he locate one body in two different places, or two bodies in one and the same place by penetrating them?

Briefly, I think the answer to all these points is no, because they are all contrary to the principles of natural philosophy and the way in which Nature is ordered. To deal with the second part first: the more accurate and more widely held opinion is that an evil spirit cannot simultaneously fill up places which are at a distance from one another and leave the space in between them unoccupied. Still less, therefore, will he be able to do this with a single object. This is something reserved to God alone. Nor do examples which tell us that many people have appeared to others in a different place aútorpoownws \[in their own person\] contradict this, in as much as the individuals really did appear at that time, not only to people who were asleep, but also to people who were awake. If saintly people have made appearances in a miraculous manner, as we read St Nicholas, St Agatha, and St Benedict did, these stemmed from God\'s unlimited power. If, on the other hand, they were made by evil angels, they should be considered simply as visual appearances produced by conjuring-tricks. I am referring to a case recorded by Origen in Against Celsus Book 6, \[where he says\] that Pythagoras was seen in two cities at the same time. There is another \[example\] in the life of St Germain about women who were guests at the same feast, and one in Zonaras about the son of the Emperor, who was shown to his father by the monk Theodore. (See Peter Thyraeus Book 2, chapter 8 and the following chapters.)
[Page 91]

In Book 4 of his Character of Evil Spirits, D\'Anania mentions, among other things, that an evil spirit cannot occupy the body of two human beings simultaneously, but when he is substantially in the body of one of them, he can use his power to tempt another person, or someone at a great distance, to \[commit\] some offence. I confess I do not understand this, because there is nothing to prevent two people from being so close to each other that they are the equivalent, so to speak, of a single space occupied substantially at one and the same time by the evil spirit. \[So\] I say that there is nothing to stop their being possessed simultaneously by an evil spirit. But if one person is a long way away from the person who has been possessed, so that the \[intervening\] space is greater than the radius of the evil spirit\'s activity, I do not believe the evil spirit which is possessing him can make any kind of assault upon the other person. You see, just as the Devil cannot try to move any object any distance at all from its place, so he cannot try to move the minds of just anyone a long way from their bodies-only those of people who are so close together that they may be considered to be, as it were, the equivalent of a single place \[occupied by\] the evil spirit. (Guillaume d\'Auvergne has several pertinent things to say on this subject in the last part of his Universe, chapter 13.)

The first part of my conclusions is proved because the more sensible natural philosophers, in company with Aristotle and St Thomas \[Aquinas\], do not grant that the physical aspects and dimensions of Nature can be penetrated. Therefore, an evil spirit cannot change the size of a body so that a human being can creep in the likeness of a cat or a weasel into a bedroom through a narrow chink, much less through closed doors. (The Carmelite Jan de Beets has dealt with this well at the end of chapter 4 of his exposition of the First Commandment). Consequently, the story that silly person from Madaura tells about a vampire-witch \[lamia\] in Milesia who turned into a weasel must be considered fictitious.

Those witches \[striges\] from Lotharingia, too, lied when they persuaded Nicholas Rémy that an evil spirit is accustomed to give power to experienced childkilling witches \[lamiis\] so that they can penetrate houses and, without any problem, create a way for themselves through any narrow places by contracting and shrinking themselves into \[the form of\] mice, cats, locusts, and other tiny living things of this kind and then, having gained entry, of restoring themselves to their former shape again. Scavius, in Book 5 of \[Johannes\] Nider\'s Ant-Hill, told similar lies, because these things are all craziness and deceptive illusion. It is merely that an evil spirit goes ahead, secretly opens and closes doors or windows wide enough to allow the women\'s bodies to come through them, and the women think they have clothed themselves in the shape of this kind of living creature, which is what more experienced Italian wise women \[sagae\] confessed to \[Paolo\] Grillando. But anyone who remembers what was done by the angel when he brought St Peter out of prison-when there is no need at all to say that this opening of doors and the guards\' being asleep were miracleswill have no doubt that an evil spirit can accomplish this opening and closing of doors in such a subtle manner.

Suppose someone objects that St \[John\] Chrysostom attributes this power to angels when he writes that Habakkuk was brought out and led away from an enclosed pit by an angel, while the seals \[on the entrance\] continued to be unbroken. This is what the oration says. It is about the disbelief of St Thomas, and is among the orations of the \[Church\] Fathers published separately in Rome: \'How the angel could take Ambakoum \[Habakkuk\] to the lions\' den and bring him out again, leaving the closed seals in good condition\'. A method witches \[striges\] sometimes mention is that the Devil opens up the walls themselves by making a kind of cleft or break, and so provides them with a way in and out, and afterwards makes the separate parts \[of the wall\] close up again. I know this will be seen as credible by those who admit that parts \[of things\] can be penetrated, and that reference will be made to what happened to the notorious Magdalena de la Cruz in Córdoba. (The wall suddenly gaped open, and the young woman was seen at her prayers by passers-by). But I think the whole thing was either a conjuring-trick, or an evil spirit, with immense speed, removed the requisite number of stones, retained others needed to keep the wall standing, and afterwards, with the same speed and dexterity, put them back in place again.
[Page 92]

I also think that since human eyesight cannot catch the speed of the stone-cutter from Hell, it happens to come to an erroneous opinion about a wall which has been opened by having parts of it squeezed together. Undoubtedly Weyer, along with his actual teacher, Calvin, is irreligious when he talks drivel about the way Christ our Lord came in to His disciples after the resurrection when the doors had been closed, because quite rightly Catholic writers, along with the most important and most holy Fathers \[of the Church\], recognise the argument for \[there being\] a clear miracle in this penetration of a solid object.

Likewise, \[Theodore\] Beza and those like him blaspheme on the subject of Christ our Lord\'s birth from an intact virgin\'s womb, and His resurrection when His sepulchre remained close shut. These bestial human beings maintain that these things opened up as long as He was passing through and closed again afterwards, as though a created thing could not obey its Creator in this, as in everything else. But these people do everything they can to disparage Christ our Lord\'s divinity and omnipotence in order to build a road for Turkishness and paganism.

Therefore, because an evil spirit cannot change the size \[of something\] this way, and so compress it that its parts penetrate one another, he cannot, (however large it may be and whatever its colour), make an object invisible to those in whose presence it exists, either, provided their eyes are sound and have not been subjected to conjuring-tricks. It can happen, however, that by chance they do not see anything else, because if the object goes somewhere else quickly, it is no longer in their sight. If, on the other hand, \[an evil spirit\] stopes the bystanders\' eyes from seeing things because he puts some object into the space in between, or because the movement of the air is much too great, or because the object changes shape for some reason he finds plausible-I find these are the methods he usually employs-under those circumstances the object will not actually be seen. In fact, it will remain invisible.

This is how, according to Philostratus, Apollonius removed himself from Domitian\'s sight, using a deception by evil spirits. This is how, according to Cicero, Gyges lay hidden, concealed by the fictitious ring. This is the story the silly Greeks tell about Perseus\'s shield, and this is how one should interpret what John of Salisbury writes about one individual: \'He was the most skilled of magicians, and the result was that he could make anything he wanted invisible, although at other times he was seen to transform them into other kinds \[of things\]\', (Courtiers\' Trifles Book chapter 9). Likewise, what the necromancer I mentioned had persuaded Willem van Gulik in \[Jacob de\] Meyer, Book 10; what Celsus was saying about Cleomedes of Astypalaea, who went into a large box and, when inside, pulled down the lid, and when they found he was not inside the box, they believed he had flown away. (Read Origen, Against Celsus Book 3). Then there\'s the story recorded by several people that he who wears the gemstone \'heliotrope\' becomes invisible. I don\'t believe it because, as Guillaume d\'Auvergne convincingly puts it, the stone would have to be able to remove every bit of colour from the object or, obviously, introduce others into it in such a way that \[the wearer\] could not be recognised. But what they say about the presence of such great power in the stone has not been shown \[to be true\] by reliable evidence from any authority.

Finally, from these \[points\] one can uncover evil spirits\' illusions and give them a good drubbing when \[it is claimed\] they make the parts of anyone\'s body appear to be huge, or non-existent, with the result that they seem to have been removed. (See the tales told in the Hammer of Women who Work Harmful Magic, about the men who thought their penises had been taken away, Sprenger Part 2, chapter 7, or the nonsense on reads in Book 2, folio 429 of The Belief one should have in Evil Spirits). Nor do I think an evil spirit has the power to stretch a small person\'s bones in such a way that he makes them gigantic in size, and so Pedro Cieza, in Part 2, chapter 42, is absolutely justified in classifying the Cichorani Indians\' boast that they could do this by means of certain herbs as a fairy-story.
[Page 93]

Book 2, Question 18

Can magicians transform the bodies of one species into those of another?

I am not talking about the fabulous metamorphoses in Ovid, Parthenius, and other \[writers\], nor about the natural changes which take place in living creatures which have not yet finished growing, as discussed by Aristotle and Pliny. I am talking about transformations brought about by magic which, as the result of the power of evil spirits, \[change\] one type of thing which is fully complete into the different shape of something which is fully complete, although Ovid and Propertius had this idea more than anyone else-for example, Propertius,

\'She was bold enough to impose laws on the moon she had enchanted, And to disguise her back during her nocturnal sport\', \[Elegies 4.5.13-14\];

And Ovid \[says\],

\'I suspect she flits, living, through the night shadows, And her aged body is concealed by feathers\'-\[Amores 8.13-14\].

The people of Catania used to think similar things about the Sicilian Liodorus, as I pointed out in Book 1. \[Similar\] stories are told about Simon Magus in the Voyages of St Peter;25⁶ likewise \[John of\] Salisbury about a particular individual in the book I mentioned earlier; likewise the annals of the English about King Bladud and, from the same source, a story that Uther \[Pendragon\] was transformed to look like Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, by the incantations of Ambrose Merlin, so that he could sleep with Igerna as his wife, and from this irreligious copulation were born Arthur and Anna. (Read Geoffrey of Monmouth and Ludovico Pontico Virunio.)²⁵⁷ Moreover, this idea thrust itself into the New World, because the Nicaraguans used to believe that their witches \[striges\] could change themselves into cats, monkeys, and pigs, and the Guatemalans used to think that a notorious worker of harmful magic, Augustina, went about in the shape of a cow when Beatriz de la Cuva died in a huge flood and earthquake. (\[Pedro\] Cieza tells the story in his history of Peru Part 2, chapters 205 and 210.)

Now, although in the past, in company with the general school of theologians I have publicly professed an opinion about lycanthropes and things of this kind-namely, that they are all illusory and deceptive and are at odds with Nature-once again at this point, when the exigencies of the debate demand it, my judgement is that one must affirm that the degradation of a human being\'s becoming an animal is also illusory and deceptive. I add that question 5 of the canon Episcopi threatens the penalty of excommunication against anyone who maintains the opposite, a judgement which is supported by the authority of St Augustine.

Reason tells us the same thing. The human soul cannot inform an animal\'s body, just as the soul of a lion \[cannot inform\] the body of a horse, or a horse\'s soul a human body. The reason is that for any substantial form to endow its own \[body\] with the qualities essential to it, it requires arrangements peculiar to and harmonious with itself, and a special provision of physical senseorgans. Hence the action of a body with sense-organs is defined by the soul. Consequently, it appears that an animal soul cannot inform a human body, nor a human \[soul the body\] of an animal, as I said. So, the soul of a human being will not be able to migrate to the body of an animal in order to inform it. Still less will the soul be able to undergo change along with the body, as it appears Horace thought \[possible\] in his Epodes when he describes Circe\'s restoration of Ulysses\'s companions \[to their human shape\].

\'Ulysses\'s long-suffering oarsmen Stripped the rough skins full of bristles From their bodies, with Circe\'s consent. Then their reason and voice Glided back, and their former dignity \[returned\] to their faces\', \[17.15-18\].
[Page 94]

But they had not actually lost their human reason, that is, the most important part of the human soul. The soul is immortal and cannot be damaged or wounded by an evil spirit. Therefore, those who think they have been transformed into something else are always labouring under an illusion, just as those who think they are seeing something when they are not seeing it at all are often deluded, too. An intelligent person who does not wish to be deceived must distinguish the transformation itself from the effects which accompany it, and if

\[Jean de\] Sponde had done this, he would not have babbled so many juvenile inanities in his commentaries on Homer.

Let us conclude that this transformation is a delusion, although many of its accompanying effects are entirely real. Carnage, for example, is wreaked upon human beings or their herds (a) by an evil spirit in a body made of air, or in the body of a wolf, or (b) by human beings disguised as wolves, (I shall clarify this later), (c) or by human beings not disguised like this, who go about in human form but behave in a bestial fashion. It can happen, you see, that because of a defect in the humours and an excess of black bile, certain wolfish tendencies take over their mind, along with a hatred of flocks and humans, and the desire to attack them, tear them to pieces, and devour them. Hence physicians classify Aunáwva or huxavopwπia \[lycanthropy\] as illnesses. Arab \[physicians\] call this \'chatrab\' \[qutrub\], and Latin speakers, \'melancholia\' or \'lupine madness\'. Because of a similar defect, some people think they are dogs or lions or other brute beasts.

Those who suffer only from this kind of illness are not magicians, and although they think they are wolves and imitate the savage behaviour of wolves, to other people they look like human beings. According to St Augustine, Praestantius\'s father used to think he was a wolf, although no one else did; so did another individual, (see Thomas of Brabant or Cantimpré), the Patavian farmer in \[Job\] Fincel\'s Wonders, Book 2, the Prussian in \[Georg\] Schuler\'s commentary on Book 7 of \[Ovid\'s\] Metamorphoses, and the man described by \[Pietro\] Pomponazzi who is quoted by \[Johann von\] Ewich in his book on the character of wise women \[sagarum\]. But when other people, too, see them as wolves, dogs, cats, or other brute beasts-such as the woman in Palladius\'s Life of Macarius of Alexandria who appeared to be a mare, or the Neuri in Herodotus and Mela, or in our own day, according to popular opinion \[what happens\] to certain Irish people every year, (for which see the second part of \[William\] Camden\'s Ireland)-this is caused by magic and cannot proceed from illness alone.

The Devil usually deceives in a number of different ways. Sometimes he substitutes one body for another, and while the original person is elsewhere and has been put to sleep in some secret place, he puts on the body of a wolf, or makes one out of air, wraps himself in it, and does the things which people believe have been done by the poor wretch who is actually asleep somewhere else. (The story of this stratagem, which is revealed to everyone by a holy man, is told by Guillaume d\'Auvergne in the last part of his work I cited earlier, chapter 13). But sometimes he wraps the humans themselves as appropriately as he can in the real skins of wild animals. He does this when he gives them a wolf\'s pelt which they are supposed to keep hidden in some hollow treetrunk. This is well-established from certain people\'s confessions. Sometimes, in accordance with the pact \[he has made with them\], he surrounds the magicians with the likeness of an animal, which he has made from the air, and builds the copy round each part of their body, fitting head to head, mouth to mouth, belly to belly, foot to foot, and arm to arm.
[Page 95]

This usually happens when \[the magicians\] apply certain ointments to themselves for this purpose, as in the well-known case of the lycanthrope Dolanus, which has been published in court records, or when they merely use the words they have learned \[from the Devil\], such as \[the magician\] torn to pieces by dogs in front of the Duke of Russia, and one Bajanus in Bulgaria about whom Sigebert \[of Gembloux\] writes in his chronicle. (In this and the preceding case, a wolf\'s tracks left imprints on the ground). There is nothing remarkable in the last case if they are found afterwards with real wounds in those parts of their human body which had received a blow when they were \[wearing\] the body of the wild animal, because the air which was cast round them could not be relied on, gave way, and the wound inhered in their real body. When the real body has re-appeared, the Devil wounds that part of the body of those he has taken elsewhere, which he knows has been wounded in the animal body.

Bartolomeo della Spina tells an anecdote from his own time in his Inquiry into Witches, chapter 16. \'Another witness of this apparent transformation of night-flying witches \[striges\] into cats, a cobbler from Ferrara by the name of Filippo, made the following declaration to me under oath in court earlier this year. Three months previously, he said, a certain witch \[strix\] had undertaken to cure his child of a bewitchment for which, perhaps, she herself may have been responsible, on condition he would not stop her from coming near his child if he were to see any female cats fawning or behaving in a playful manner round him. Well now, that same day, an hour after she had left the house, Filippo and his wife notice a large female cat they had never seen before, coming towards the child at a fast pace. This frightened his parents, and they made several attempts to drive it away but were distressed to see that it kept coming back.

Finally, they lost both their patience and their temper with it. So, they shut the door and, while the cat raced round looking all over the place for a way to escape, Filippo took his time and then threw a spear at it and at last landed it a very heavy blow which forced it to hurl itself out of a window high up in the wall. As a result, the whole of the cat\'s body looked as though it been squashed flat. Now, from that moment onwards the elderly witch \[strix\] was confined to her bed for a good long time, since every bone in her body had been broken, a fact which strengthened \[the parents\'\] suspicion that the woman was indeed a witch \[striga\] and had subjected their child to the enchantment which was causing him very serious distress. The marks and blows the cat had received, you see, looking like the marks one finds on the bodies of the sick, were found on the elderly woman\'.

Not quite five years ago, in a village in the west of Flanders, not far from Diksmuide, very near the confluence of the Iperlee and the IJzer, while a plague caused by the evil eye \[pestis fascinaria\] was spreading in a remarkable fashion, I happened to hear the following story from a monk, a trustworthy individual, who was in the neighbourhood at the time. A peasant and his son were drinking in an ale-house, and out of the corner of his eye the man noticed that the serving-trollop was chalking up double the amount of ale when, as is their custom, he drank a toast to her. He pretended not to notice, but when he and his son had had enough, he called the landlady over and asked her for his bill. He was charged the sum which had been marked up in chalk, but refused to pay, and after the two of them had traded many words, he flung down on the table the amount he knew was correct and left. Boiling with indignation the woman called out, \'You won\'t be able to get back home today, or I\'m not the woman I am!\' But he paid her threats no heed and walked off. When he reached the stream where he had left his boat, however, neither he nor his son, (who was pretty strong), could shift it from the bank, even though they leaned on their poles with all their strength. You would think it had been nailed down in the mud.
[Page 96]

Now, it so happened that two or three soldiers were marching past, so the peasant hailed them.

\'Hey, mates! Come and help us get this boat off the bank. I\'ll pay you for it, and you can have a good drink on me\'.

They answered his call, came along, and pushed as hard as they could, but they pushed for a long time to no purpose. Then one of them, sweating and gasping for breath, said, \'Why don\'t be unload all this stuff from the boat? Perhaps we\'ll find it easier to get it down to the water if it\'s empty\'. So that\'s what they did and then-pay attention to this!-they saw a huge sallow toad in the bottom of the boat, looking at them with glittering eyes. One of the soldiers did not pick it up but drilled a hole in its swollen throat with the point of his sword and threw it into the water. There, as if dead, it rolled over on to its back, belly upwards. The rest of the soldiers inflicted further wounds on it while it was afloat, and suddenly the boat came free. The peasant was pleased and brought his helpers back to the same alehouse he had left earlier. He asked for a drink, and the waitress brought him one. He asked after the landlady and was told she had become very ill and was in bed, dying.

\'Stupid woman!\' he said. \'Do you think I\'m drunk? I left her standing over there scarcely half an hour ago, and she was in good health and a nasty frame of mind, just like you. I\'m going to go and see what\'s going on\'.

He went into the bedroom and found that the woman had died of wounds which had dug into and slashed open her neck and stomach. \'How did she get these wounds?\' he exclaimed. The waitress insisted she did not know and was sure the woman had not set foot outwith the house. The case went before a magistrate who came to the conclusion that the wounds had been caused by both slashing and stabbing blows, and that they had appeared in the very same places in which the soldiers had struck the toad. The toad itself was nowhere to be found. (There is another story, not unlike this one, which I shall tell in Book 5, section 3, towards \[the words\] \'they will be sufficient for torture\', concerning indication 8 talking about naming names.)

It is about ten years ago that one Peter Stumpf was put to death in Bedburg, a small town in the territory of Köln, because for more than twenty years he had consorted with an evil spirit in the form of a succuba. She had given him a wide belt, and when he put it on, he and others thought he was turned into a wolf. In this form he had ripped out the throats of fifteen children and eaten their brains. He had tried to devour his two daughters-in-law, and he had treated his own daughter and his godmother as his wives. All this is well-known from court records and from engravings which are openly on sale.

Anyone who wants further conspicuous examples of these transformations should read \[Jean de\] Sponde on Book 10 of Homer\'s Odyssey; \[Peter\] Binsfeld, Confessions of Workers of Harmful Magic, conclusion 3; \[Nicolas\] Rémy, Worship of Evil Spirits Book 2, chapter 5; Giovanni \[Lorenzo\] D\'Anania, The Character of Evil Spirits, Book 4, folio 180; \[Battista\] Codronchi, op.cit. chapter 7; and Petrus Thyraeus who gave careful consideration to more \[of these and in better order, than anyone else in his theses, The Apparitions of Spirits \[Spirituum\] Book 2 and Book 15 as far as chapter 24; and Brother Claude Prieur who used him to put together his dialogue in his book on lycanthropy.
[Page 97]

Those who want to argue for real metamorphoses, (such as \[Jean de\] Sponde, \[Jean\] Bodin, \[Kaspar\] Peucer, Philippus Camerarius, and a few others), produce a single piece of evidence from Holy Scripture, which it is worth our while to explain-Nebuchadnezzar\'s \[change\] into an ox, and that of Lot\'s wife into a statue of salt. But since both these happened as the result of divine power, they can have no importance for changes brought about by evil spirits. In the case of Nebuchadnezzar, too, most Fathers \[of the Church\] deny that he assumed the form of an OX or the likeness of an ox\'s body. They interpret \[the incident\] simply \[by saying\] that his reason was so estranged that he believed he was an OX. Not to drag out the argument, it seems to me that an explanation more consonant with what Holy Scripture says, the explanation of St Gregory in his Moralia Book 5, chapter 8, and reason, is that of interpreters \[who say\] that the condition of the King\'s body changed into the constitution of an ox, that his human shape had degenerated to some extent into that of a wild animal, and that he had received internal senses which were like those of brute beasts. So as a result, he started to walk on all fours, as cattle do, to eat hay, avoid human beings, and spend his time in the open air.

Finally, objection can be made to what Herodotus wrote-that sometimes a plane-tree has turned into an olive-tree-and some of the Alpine peoples \[have said\] that an evil spirit has changed human bodies into statues of salt. My reply is that if they were walking about a change which happens almost immediately and without \[the help of\] an intermediary, that was an illusion and a conjuring-trick. But if they were talking about a change \[helped by\] an intermediary, or \[effected\] by the various changes caused by decay and the production of a second piece of matter, there is no reason why both cannot happen naturally, after the appropriate arrangements have been introduced into the matter to \[cause\] these final forms. We read among the wonders performed by St Spiridon \[of Trimythous\] that he changed a snake into gold in order to deceive a greedy, pitiless rich man, and that afterwards he changed it back from gold to a snake again. This was a real change, because it was miraculous and effected by God who has the power to do it. Perhaps this change would not be impossible for an evil spirit, but \[he would have to do it\] in successive stages because a snake is something which has been divided into segments, and the nearest matter which is the same as that of gold and a snake is undoubtedly earth.

Book 2, Question 19

Can magicians make brute beasts talk, and can they understand what the brute beasts are saying?

Alfonso de Mendoza has examined this question in his Scholastic Topics for Discussion, question 5, following St Thomas \[Aquinas\], The Power \[of God\], question 6, article 5 and \[Francisco de\] Vitoria, Magic, number 9, but it is incumbent on me to speak more clearly and with greater accuracy. There can be no doubt that sometimes it can happen, by divine power, that those who possess no power of speech by Nature can, nevertheless, speak. Holy Scripture attests this of Balaam\'s ass, (Numbers 22). God Himself, who is the creator of all speech, knows in what way He makes this happen. Since He formed the organs of articulate speech we know about, He can also choose other instruments for this purpose, if He so chooses. But in general, I think He uses the services of angels who speak via inanimate objects or brute beasts. However, I make this distinction. \[When they speak\] through those things which have organs suitable for the purpose and are living instruments, such as magpies, crows, parrots, and so forth, language has been fashioned in their very bodies, in those circumstances, speech is an action connected with the creature\'s life, not one connected with its understanding.
[Page 98]

It is, however, connected with the understanding when angels do it. But in the case of those things which are indeed alive, but do not possess organs suitable for speech-asses and oxen, for example-I should think \[speech\] happens because the angel himself is speaking in them, or rather next to them, and has fashioned what he is saying in the air. The same can be said of things which have no organs of sensory perception, such as fire, air, water, earth, dead bodies, severed heads, statues, and trees. In those circumstances, when a voice is simply fashioned next to those objects, the speaking should not be attributed in any way to anything other than the angel, as the one who is giving form to the air and producing it as his medium and instrument, and not as a living action. If the air is being given form inside a body which is capable of sensation, but inadequate \[for the task of speaking\], or even inside one which is incapable of sensation, \[the ability to speak\] can be bestowed on it \[with the body acting\] as its instrument.

Now that these points have been made, it will be easy to come to a judgement about the following miraculous examples of speaking \[we find\] in sacred history, such as Balaam\'s ass, (on which you should consult \[Cardinal\] Cajetan\'s commentary): the angel speaking to Moses and to Esdras from a bramble-bush; Spiridion\'s dead daughter, Irene, indicating the \[hiding\] place of something which had been left with her: someone who had been killed, indicating that he had been murdered on Macarius\'s orders: the other Macarius\'s conversation at the execution-ground about the burial-places of the condemned, and the venerable confessors of Africa who still used to speak clearly even though their tongues had been torn out by the root during the Vandal persecution. (This has been confirmed on the Emperor Justinian\'s authority as something very well attested by the histories of his own time. Polydore Vergil tells a similar story about an English priest in Book 13 of his history of the English). In these \[examples\] one miracle happened after another as God, in the role of efficient cause, filled the place of the parts which had been cut away.

Let me add one \[example\] from Antonio Bonfini. \'About three years after the Emperor Sigismund was disastrously defeated by the Turks at Nicopolis, many people were going down into the plain and heard a voice coming repeatedly from among the bones, crying out the names of Jesus Christ, our Saviour, and the Virgin Mary. They found a speaking head among the corpses, and when it realised there were people in its vicinity, it said, \"Why are you standing there so amazed, gentlemen?

I am a Christian. I fell, unconfessed and unshriven, in this war. Mother Mary is not allowing me to be condemned to eternal torture. She has kept me still in control of my tongue so that I can confess my wrong-doings and purify my mind with Apostolic rites. So please, send for a priest to hear my confession and give me absolution\". Asked why he had deserved such a great favour from the Virgin, he replied that during life he had had a particular devotion to her, celebrated her seven feast-days every year with very great reverence, and honoured her on religious fast-days \[by taking\] only bread and water. So, they sent for a priest from the nearest village, and he duly heard \[the man\'s\] confession, who received remission of all his sins and, after receiving this final cleansing, suddenly fell silent and remained quiet ever after\'. This is what he says. Those who want to make changes should read it and come to their senses again in the face of such an evident miracle which commends devotion to the Mother of God, fasting, observance of feast-days, and the sacrament of confession. (You will find a story not unlike this in Thomas of Cantimpré, The Universal Good Book 2, chapter 29, sub-section The Devil apes God. He has attempted many things similar to what I have been talking about.
[Page 99]

His, however, are pseudo-miracles. Sometimes God allows him to do this so that divine vengeance and justice can be shown clearly, such as when a severed head indicated that Cercydes was a murderer, (my source is Aristotle), and when the head of Orpheus predicted to Cyrus, King of Persia, that he too would be killed by a woman. Sometimes he makes up any old oracle, such as the one Phlegon of Tralles tells us about. He took it from Heron, and its tenor is as follows. Polycritus married Locrides and slept with her for three nights. On the third day he died, leaving her pregnant, and she gave birth to a monster of both sexes. It was brought into the midst of a meeting of the people so that they could be consulted about what this presaged, or what should be done about it. Polycritus appeared as a ghost in the middle of the people and predicted that a disaster would come to the Aetolians and Locrians, and that the people would have no power to resist it. He removed his monstrous son\'s head, swallowed \[the rest of\] him, and vanished, and not long afterwards the head spoke of the same disasters. Phlegon, quoting Antisthenes, a Peripatetic philosopher, adds that when the consul Acilius Glabrio defeated Antiochus,

King of Asia, the Romans had been terrified by oracles \[which said they should not invade Asia any more, and the head of Publius, the Roman commander, which had been left behind by a wolf after it had devoured the body, as he himself had predicted when moved by a divine frenzy, (so it is thought), chanted in a long speech that disaster would befall the Romans.

Certain \'speakings\' among the pagans were clearly conjuring-tricks and counterfeits carried out with the help of an evil spirit for the monetary gain of the pagans\' priests, who not infrequently were magicians and fortune-tellers. The two speaking doves at Dodona are an example, as is the oak at Dodona, Argus\'s boat, Achilles\'s horse, the \[Indian\] ascetics\' elm-tree which greeted Apollonius, and the Rover Causus which said, \'Hallo, Pythagoras!\' (In his Miscellanies, Clement \[of Alexandria\] says that Pythagoras was the owner of books belonging to Zoroaster the magician). Simon Magus\'s dog spoke to St Peter and others, (see Clement \[of Alexandria\], Journey and Glycas, Annals). \[Paolo\] Grillando, whom I have often praised, ascribes the same thing to a wise-woman \[sagae\], Francesca of Siena, in question 7. Theoctenus, a magician in Antioch during the reign of Maximinus, used the power of magic to make a statue of Jupiter pour forth prophecies which roused a hatred of Christians among the citizenry and whetted the Emperor\'s persecution. (Read St Cyril of Alexandria, who reviews several of the things I have said earlier, in his Against Julian Book 3, and add, from Valerius Maximus Book 1, the statue of Fortune in Rome, which spoke on the Via Latina).

No angel, however, can give animals the power to know or understand what they are saying. An evil spirit, though, could make animals say certain things in a way particularly apt to their place and time, things adapted to individuals and situations which were relevant at that moment. But although the evil spirit could do this on purpose, the animals could do it only by chance and by accident. To the ignorant and uneducated this might furnish \[evidence of\] a certain quickness of mind and intellectual understanding. \[But\] magicians, too, sometimes cause animals to make remarkable mimicking gestures and movements-examples are Valerius\'s story about the snake in Epidaurus, Philostratus\'s anecdote about Apollonius\'s lion, and \[Pierre\] Belon\'s tale about a donkey in Cairo²⁷¹-and ignorant individuals think they could not do this unless they were able to reason and make judgements. With the help of an evil spirit, a magician can pretty easily corrupt the organs of the body and cause a human being to be heard to bark, howl, croak, or bray while he is trying to speak.
[Page 100]

After all, we see that several people are quite happy to do this by artifice, and we read that in 1546 Margarita from Esslingen became so swollen because of pains in her belly that its bulk began to hide her face and seemed to be more than ten palms\' breadth all the way round. Those who were standing round her bed heard cocks crowing, hens clucking, geese honking, dogs barking, sheep bleating, pigs grunting, cattle lowing, and horses whinnying. An extraordinarily large worm came out of her side, as did about a hundred and fifty snakes-a marvel which would be convincing were it not for that fact that these were nothing more than evil spirits\' conjuring-tricks, invented by the girl\'s mother in order to make money. Sometimes infants\' cries are heard in the wombs of pregnant women, but this is a natural occurrence and Andreas Libavius has provided many examples, and carefully proved it with the addition of arguments from natural philosophy throughout the whole of Volume 2 of his work on remarkable things; and Margarita\'s story has no place in it.

But do magicians understand what brute beasts are saying? Porphyry writes that in his day it was commonly said of Apollonius of Tyana that when he heard a swallow crying out loudly with many \[others\], he explained to the companions he had with him that she was revealing to the rest of the \[swallows\] that an ass\'s cold laden with grain had fallen down in front of the city and the grain had spilled all over the ground.²⁷³ By doing this Apollonius wanted to pretend he understood the birds\' chattering, because the ancients had said this about Tiresias and Melampus. But these \[stories\] are unbelievable. Since brute beasts lack reason, they cannot employ verbal intercourse and verbal intercourse, which points out the meaning of things or actions, is necessary to enable \[people\] to carry on a deliberate conversation. I admit they are able to indicate their physical states and wants with their voices, and that human beings can gain knowledge of these by daily observation, and an evil spirit, which has a most thorough understanding of these things, could teach them to magicians. Whether he wishes to do so, or has ever done so, I do not know. It is not unbelievable that he has.

But the question is, do brute beasts, of the same species, at any rate, understand each other? As far as animals\' physical states and the ways \[they show\] what they want are concerned, daily experience tells us they do. As far as everything else is concerned, Porphyry thought, and tried to prove, that birds understand the speech and songs of their own type and can point out to other birds what is suitable for them. Plato thought the same, and so did Oppian when dealing with what elephants think, because if an elephant falls down into the mire and cries out, when his companion sees this, it goes away and comes back bringing the herd with it so that they can make a combined effort to protect the one which is stuck.

There is also the example of the Libyan scorpion. When it has not been able to strike a human being all by itself, it comes back with several other scorpions, and they link together to form a ring and attack the human simultaneously. Lastly, there is the example of a fish which escapes through a break in a trap and warns other fish of the danger, the result being that no fish of that species are seen that day. (See Pierre Grégoire, Republic Book 15, chapter 5 where he mentions these very points and learnedly tells us that animals lack genuine understanding and ability to speak). I add that an evil spirit cannot endow animals with either of these because he cannot bestow a ration soul on them, creation of this being reserved to God alone. Moreover, \[speech\] requires physical organs appropriate to that purpose, which is a topic I shall investigate in the following question.
[Page 101]

Book 2, Question 20

Can an evil spirit give animals the ability to speak?

This investigation depends on whether brute beasts have been endowed with any kind of reason. If they have been, an evil spirit will easily make them able to converse and have a full understanding \[of what is being said\], once he has removed anything standing in the way of their being able to do so. If they have not been \[so endowed\], he certainly cannot make them able \[to talk and understand\]. Now, there have been not a few people who attribute reason to most animals. Empedocles, according to Sextus Empiricus who cites him, said that all animals and plants have understanding and foresight, and so did Democritus, according to Stobaeus in his Eclogues on Natural Phenomena. It appears Lactantius was of the same opinion in his \[Divine\] Institutes Book 3, chapter 10. Porphyrius \[says so\] quite openly in Sacrifices Book 3, as does Plutarch in his essay \'Brute beasts make use of reason\' and \'Do creatures which live on land have more reason than those which live in water?\' and in his essay exhorting people to study the arts, Galen writes that there is an ÉVδIábetov Xóyov in all living creatures. Erasmus translated this, (not very well), as \'reason capable of feelings.\' \[Andrés\] Laguna of Segovia \[translated\] it better as \'internal reason\' or \'reason which shelters inside.

The result is that Galen does indeed attribute to brute beasts the faculty of reason which also exists in human beings but makes the simple distinction that human beings are able to put their reasoning into words, whereas brute beasts may have reason but cannot express their mental concepts in words. This was also Quintilian\'s opinion in his Education of an Orator Book 1, and among more recent authors with the same opinion are Antonio Cittadini in his commentary on Aristotle\'s Posterior Analytics Book 1, chapter 3: Lorenzo Valla in chapter 9 of his Dialectic: and Cardinal Hosjusz, indeed, had the idea that we are distinguished from brute beasts not by reason, speech, or intelligence, but by religion, and worship and contemplation of God. I should think these words of his should be explained religiously, since he spoke the way Holy Scripture does, denying that he was saying these things are of less importance, not that he was judging them to be of no importance at all, so that the sense of what he thought is that a human being differs from brute beasts more in religion than he does in those other things-speech, intelligence, and reason.

One\'s conclusion, therefore, is that to attribute reason, rational discourse, intelligence, foresight (in the proper sense of the word), and discernment to brute beasts runs counter to correct natural philosophy and the Faith, but that there is in brute beasts some kind of ingenuity which imitates reason, intelligence, and rational discourse. This is the opinion of Albertus Magnus in Book 3 of his work on the soul, and of Philoponus in text 157 \[of his commentary on Aristotle\'s De Anima\] where Aristotle \[says\] this quite openly, as does St Thomas \[Aquinas\] in 1.2, question 13, article 3 and \[Pierre\] Grégoire, op.cit. Book 3, question 1. In Book 7, chapter 1 of his Inquiry into Animals, Aristotle attributes traces of the human mind and a likeness of intelligence to them.

This is where Arnobius gets his opinion from in Against the Heathen Book 2. \[17\] when he writes that many \'likenesses\' of rationality and intelligence are seen in brute beasts. In his essay on the usefulness of parts of the body, Book 1, chapter 3 Galen, says that Hippocrates was of the same opinion, and Averroes in his \[commentary on Aristotle\'s\] Physics Book 7, Girolamo Maggi in The Fiery Destruction of the World Book 2, chapter 5, Gabriele Zerbi in \[his commentary on Aristotle\'s Metaphysics Book 1, question 7, (which it is well worth your while to read), and Cardinal \[Francisco de\] Toledo in his \[commentary on Aristotle\] The Soul Book 3, question 7, have said the same.
[Page 102]

They say that brute beasts do many things skilfully and are taught the things they seem to do as a result of rational discourse \[with their trainer\]. Many people say as much, and in his Century 1, letter 50, \[Justus\] Lipsius has collected what a very large number of sources have said about elephants. Aelian \[has done the same\] for the rest of the animals-for example, lions, (The Character of Animals Books 5 and 7): bulls (Book baboons \[cynocephali\] (Book 6): other monkeys (Book 5): stags (Book 11) where, however, кало́́vтш σuvíel should not be translated as \'he understood them when they were talking\', but \'he understood them when they were calling\', that is, using the meaning of the Greek word given to it by the rearer and tamer of wild animals, just as in Book 8, chapter 4, the same author says of fish калобрегос Éπanoúelv, \'when summoned, they can hear\'. The protonotary Luis Pérez de Portillo \[has recorded\] wonderful things about dogs in his single volume on dogs, folio 16 sq. and about horses in his single volume on the horse, folio 83 sq.-a few years ago he dedicated both books to the sagacious Philip II, King of Spain-and Joachim Camerarius has brought together exemplary stories about many other living creatures in the tenth decuria of his books on problems.

Whether animals are guided by reason can be tested in a few words. It would be perfectly rational to say that if they are guided by reason, they would operate out of choice, and if they were operating out of choice, every creature of the same kind would not always operate in the same way everywhere, as they do. If they were endowed with \[the ability to hold\] rational discourse, they would know certain universal principals without which no one can discourse positively or negatively. It is generally agreed, however, that brute beasts do not know universal principles. Therefore, if they have been endowed with reason and \[the capacity for\] rational discourse, \[they have also been endowed\] with knowledge, foresight, and discernment. Therefore, they know the reasons for things and how to distinguish things which are more good \[from\] those which are less good. If they have been endowed with reason, they have therefore \[been endowed\] with free will, too, and draw rational conclusions in relation to the things about which they discourse rationally. Therefore, they can sin and have merit. Therefore, one cannot deny them the powers of will-justice, temperance, fortitude, liberality, and obedience.

Will any natural philosopher talk such foolishness? No one, certainly, other than Mahomet who opens Heaven to the lower animals. Therefore, to avoid these absurdities, we have to say that eminent writers sometimes say that brute beasts have been endowed with reason, not because they actually do possess reason, but because they do many things as cleverly as human beings, who have been endowed with reason, usually do them. It is also said they have foresight, because they behave as though they did have it and act as if they were taking foresight as their guide in what they do. Now, foresight is a quality which puts us in a state of readiness so that we can choose the means which are suited to some purpose. Brute beasts, however, do not pursue a purpose and the means which have that purpose in view. They are borne along to it by chance.

This is difficult to understand, but Girolamo Fracastoro has offered a lucid explanation as follows that certain actions of animals go back entirely to natural impulses, but that first one has to explain whether these impulses are linked with cognition or not. Some people say that \[animals\] are directed by the intellect which knows their purposes and cannot make a mistake. This, however, does not remove the difficulty because if they mean that brute beasts are directed by God in such a way that God makes brute beasts do what they do without an intermediary, they are obviously making a mistake. But if they mean that God does this with an intermediary \[acting\] through the animals, the question recurs whether animals do this by a simple impulse of Nature or by means of their cognition which acts as intermediary.
[Page 103]

\[Fracastoro\] therefore cleverly and learnedly replies that when God created the universe, once He had provided it with something like an inborn heat, with the same moral perfection and power with which He made everything He also made their individual intrinsic characters capable of attaining the purposes due and appropriate to the whole. This is why it turns out that individual things have another purpose in mind and do many things of their own accord, while Nature and the universal order have a different end in view. The result is that that generative heat can effect such wonderful things, and warm, attract, and repel, and give shapes to parts \[of the body\], and produce paths, receptacles, locations., orderly arrangements, connections, and indeed the soul, just as if it understood the purposes of each individual. It also seems that even trees and plants make, guard, and defend their leaves, buds, flowers, fruits, and seeds with wonderful ingenuity, and it is certain that these things are done by things which have no recognition \[of why they are doing them.\]

But it has to be said that these things are done by things the things I mentioned, partly per accidens and partly per se-\'per accidens\' to the extent that each one has a particular individual character, but \'per se\' to the extent that each of them is a part of a universal Nature which God has ordained for a purpose He knows. Thus, (says Fracastoro), brute beasts, too, do certain things, not because they know why \[they do them\] and are doing them, so to speak, \'per accidens\' because they are particular individuals, but because they are parts of a universal Nature set in order by God: and they do things \'per se\' and are intent on purposes which are known, not to themselves, but to God.

For example, when a bird\'s eggs are fully grown, she is stimulated by their weight and her discomfort, and wants to lay them. This is the aim the bird knows. Another is the aim which the universe has in mind, that is, preservation of the species. This aim is not known to the bird, but is known to God and follows, so to speak, from the other one. The bird, therefore, lays her egg \'per se\' because of the stimulus, but does so \'per accidens\' in respect of her offspring. She lays her offspring in respect of herself because she is this \[particular\] bird, but she lays it in respect of the universe because she is a part of it. This is why the bird has a strong desire to lay her egg in a safe place-\'per accidens\', to preserve the species, but \'per se\' because she loves the egg as a part of herself. Hence other instances of \'taking note\' \[subnotiones\], too, happen to animals according to the perceptible forms they receive of things they need for this purpose

Therefore, (says Fracastoro), the great wisdom and foresight of Almighty God can be seen, who, when He was about to give order to the whole universe, gave every individual character a particular mode of behaviour. They do not know the reasons \[for the way they behave\], but they do everything in the way which results in \[the fulfilment of\] the aims which He alone knows, and in accordance with this mode of behaviour, they do the other things we think are so wonderful. From this, it must seem that the foresight which appears in brute beasts does not actually exist, but is merely a kind of impulse of Nature and the order of the universe, established by God. (Anyone who is going to find this unsatisfactory should read Andreas Libavius\'s disputation, \'A consideration of the understanding of beasts\' in Part 2 of his Remarkable Things which I acquired when it was first published.)

Book 2, Question 21

Can evil spirits deprive a human being of feeling, or make him sleep for a very long time, or go without food?
[Page 104]

As far as the first \[point\] is concerned, my question is not whether an evil spirit can cause a body to have no power of feeling, but whether he can actually cause something which is sensitive by nature not to feel, for example, a body subjected to torture not to feel pain. In his book on the Egyptian mysteries, just before the middle, Iamblichus, speaking about pagan diviners, testifies that many of these soothsayers were not burned when fire was applied to them or, if they were burned, they did not feel the burning or any of the other tortures; and he adds that this happened because there was a god blowing from within \[them\], driving away the fire and quenching everything else. Who was this god of the magician Iamblichus other than an evil spirit, some kind of Eurycles?

What were these diviners other than workers of harmful magic \[malefici\]? Did pagans think the edge of a sword is blunted by a magical incantation in such a way that it is unable to graze the skin lightly when it touches it? There is no lack of people who, to do away with this superstition, note that God often suspended the power of a flame, of water, of wild animals, and similar quite dreadful torments by means of a miracle, and rendered them all harmless to the martyrs, but that when they had been delivered to the axe or the sword He did not restrain the power of the sword, so that the nations would understand that these things must be ascribed to a miracle and not to magic.

I am very much inclined to have my doubts whether this is true or not. This is not because of the passage from St Paul on which certain people rely-Hebrews 11.34, \'They stopped up the mouths of lions, they have quenched the assault of fire, they have put to flight the edge of the sword\', where what it says about the fire, the lions, and the edge of the sword is ascribed to a miracle. This, however, does not alter \[my opinion\], because the accurate reading is \'they escaped \[the edge of the sword\]\', as is clear from the Greek text and the Syriac translation.

The Apostle also speaks about holy people in the Old Testament who, we read, were not snatched away by a miracle because the edge of the sword was blunted, but because they miraculously escaped the swords of the enemy-some of them, such as Elias, in time of peace, but others, such as Samson, Caleb, Joshua, David, and the Maccabees, etc.-during a battle. No, other things change my opinion, because I also remember \[the passage\] about the woman struck seven times with a sword, but to no effect. The pagans also used to refer everything to an incantation, albeit falsely. I have read two other better explanations of this \[phenomenon\]: (i) the cutting edge of the sword was impeded, which could be ascribed to the negligence of the executioner; (ii) the sword is the foremost and entirely legal and regular instrument of avenging justice.

In our own day, certain irreligious soldiers think they will be invulnerable if they enchant their weapons by means of a particular ritual or, with sacrilegious daring, they stab, split, or break up the image on a crucifix, (see \[Battista\] Codronchi, Illnesses Caused by Poisons Book 3, chapter 18), or if they wear the linen garment they call \'Hell\'s vest\' under their clothes which has ghastly pictures drawn on it, or if they wear certain amulets \[periapta\] inscribed with various magical characters, or \[if they wear\] prayers which very blasphemously and untruthfully they attribute to St Leo or Charlemagne, marked with \'the Great Names of God, (which is how magicians refer to them).

I knew a lawstudent called Quirinus, a distinguished Bachelor \[of Laws\], who, putting his trust in one of these parchments, joined in quarrels and fights, often received blows without ever being wounded, and in the end was killed by a very slight wound at a party in Rome in 1572 or 1573. In this connection I should refer to what the author of The Ant Hill writes about Scafius. \'The principal author of acts of harmful magic \[maleficiorum\] in the territory of Bern was someone called Scafius. He was bold enough to boast about this in public, \[saying\] that he could make himself look like a mouse in the eyes of his rivals whenever he wanted and slip away out of the hands of his deadly enemies, and this, it is said, is how he escaped from the hands of his mortal enemies. But divine justice wanted to put an end to his roguery, and at length his enemies discovered him sitting gingerly on a stove near a window; and since he had no fear of them while they were laying siege to him, they ran him through with their swords and spears without warning via the window, and he died a miserable death in that place because of his crimes\'. Thus \[Johannes\] Nider, \[Formicarius 5.4.\]
[Page 105]

This is how the evil spirit deludes his followers. Every day, workers of harmful magic \[malefici\] escape the fierceness of their tortures upon the rack because they overcome all their torments either with a smile, or sleep, or silence. An astonishing story belonging to this genre is told by \[Claude\] Caron. A fifty-year old women whom he knew made light of it, in the way \[I have described\], when melted lard was poured all over her body and every part of her body was pulled apart. When she was taken off the rack she felt no pain, and she was unhurt and uninjured except that her big toe had been pulled off during the torture and had not been restored, although the damage did not hurt or hinder her at all. But even as she made sport of all her torments and obstinately denied everything, Satan, who had accused of her harmful magic via the mouth of a possessed woman, killed her in prison by tearing out her throat, (Antichrist Revealed, Fr. Bernard Olivier, who was Provincial of the Society of Jesus for the Spanish Netherlands at the time, told me that in 1599 a little witch-girl \[puellulam strigatricem\] was arrested near Amiens.

She used not to feel it, he said, when her feet were very savagely scorched and she was severely whipped until, on the advice of a particular priest, they placed a wax image of the Blessed Lamb against her neck. Then her evil spirit\'s conjuring-tricks were forcibly removed by the power of the sacred medicament, and she began to be fully aware of the force of the pain. Consequently, it is clear that this freedom from pain, which \[Alonso\] Tostado also acknowledges in question 354 \[of his commentary\] on Genesis chapter 13, does not arise from any physical cause, but is introduced \[into someone\] by the agency of an evil spirit; and Bartolomeo della Spina tells us in Night-Flying Witches, chapter 31, that there can be no doubt that the well-known witches\' \[sagarum\] ointment which they use for their transvections does not even have a natural power to send them to sleep, and in their ignorance of the \[actual\] causes, they usually attribute this \[inability to feel pain\] to a miracle or \[their own blamelessness.

It may happen, however, because of some remarkable strength of body, or the steadfastness of mind which both pagans and Christians have not infrequently exhibited. Let me copy out from Silius Italicus \[a passage\] about the steadfastness of one man, Marcus Attilius Regulus.

\'There was no end to the fires, the glowing hot steel, the whips Which cut his body to shreds everywhere with innumerable lashes, The murderous hands, the deadliness poured deep into his marrow, The flames visible in the midst of his wound. It was a dreadful thing to see and is a dreadful thing to relate. His limbs were stretched by \[the torturers\'\] savage craft, As far as the engines of torture would permit; and when all his blood had gushed out, His bones smoked and burned after his bones had melted. But the man\'s spirit remained unbroken. He rose above his pains And laughed, as though he were a spectator of them. He loudly rebuked the torturers for being tired, And loudly demanded to be crucified like his master\', \[Punica 1.171-181\].

Some of them use ointments and natural drugs made from poppy juice, nightshade, and similar things which throw the humours into confusion, procure a deep sleep, stop up the ends of the nerves, stupefy the senses, and hinder sensation. (Dioscorides attributes this power to the Memphite stone from Egypt). But most of them rely on a pact they make with an evil spirit, and amulets \[periaptis\] made of little Bacchic faces, or from the ashes or the nails of slaughtered unbaptised children; or they swallow a king bee; or they tie to their body small pieces of parchment \[inscribed\] with a certain type of character. They also whisper a wicked incantation, and examples of all these are provided by those who have written about the sentences \[handed down\] by criminal courts. One can see the similar operation of an evil spirit in the identifying sign of marks which the Devil imprints on witches \[strigibus\]. This \[mark\] is so devoid of sensation that driving a very long needle into it causes not the slightest pain and draws no blood. Others have written a great deal about this, \[but\] I shall copy out what \[Nicholas\] Rémy says.
[Page 106]

\'Isabelle Pardée was arrested in Épinal on 7th May 1588 on a charge of fortunetelling \[sortilegii\]. She revealed to the mayor of the city the part of her body which had been marked in this fashion by her evil spirit, and he had the idea of carrying out a test \[to see\] whether what people used to say about its insensitivity was true. So, he ordered a small pin to be thrust into it and rammed down as far as it would go. This was done in front of quite a large crowd of people. No blood at all appeared from the wound and the wise-woman \[saga\] gave those who were watching not the slightest sign that she was feeling pain. On 30th October 1590, Claude Bogart in Porrentruy was about to be put to the torture again.

Her skin had been shaved in accordance with the usual practice, and because of this a scar on top of her bare forehead became visible. The investigating judge therefore suspected the truth-namely, that this was an imprint of her evil spirit\'s fingernail, which used to be hidden by her hair before \[she was shaved\]. He ordered a small pin to be thrust very deeply into it, and when this had been done it was seen that she had no sense of being hurt, and that no blood, or very little, flowed from the wound. But she persisted in denying the truth and kept on saying that the numbness stemmed from an old blow from a stone. Not long afterwards, however, when she had been put to the torture, she not only admitted that \[the mark\] had been inflicted on her by an evil spirit, but she also gave a detailed account of the very many other things she had suffered most undeservedly at his hands. Very recently, on 14th June 1591, at Essey, which is a village a mile away from the city, the local landowner was present and ordered the recorder to put Mugette, who was charged with divination \[sortilegii\] to the test. So, this man stripped off all her clothes in order to see if he could find the identifying mark anywhere. This finally made its appearance on her left thigh, looking very much like a wart. He probed it with a knife as deeply as possible, \[but\] could not draw or force a word from Mugette, or even a drop of blood from the wound, although when he lightly stabbed the place next to the blemish, she emitted a great cry of pain and blood flowed out profusely\'. Thus Rémy, Book 1, chapter 5.

In the book by Claude Caron I have already recommended, he writes that the mark of the notorious wise-woman \[sagae\], Bayaronne, which was well hidden on her left thigh, very indistinctly outlined, the size of a penny-piece with, as it were, fine threads running out from its centre to the periphery, was entirely and completely insensitive. I also suspect that the sign of a double piece of coal on the feet of a woman from Narbonne was \[such a\] mark. (I recount this story, taken from \[Jean\] Gerson, Book 3 or 5, later.) It is common for this mark to take various shapes-a hare\'s footprint, a toad\'s hand, a small black chain. Just such a mark was seen on the back of Jean Del Vaulx, and Pierre Dheure, the investigating judge in the affair, noticed something remarkable. If you ran a needle or a pen-nib quite deeply into it, the accused did not feel any pain and did not ask what was going on. But if you threatened his chain-mark from behind at a distance with a finger held out stiff, in such a way that he could not see you, the accused man would suddenly be convulsed as though he were being tortured severely. I find no physical cause for this. I suspect a moral one-that \[the man\'s\] utterly arrogant evil spirit was smarting at being despised, and that this made him angry and furious at the torture of his slave.
[Page 107]

Very long-lasting sleep can also be produced by narcotic drugs: for example, the sleep of the peasant in Germany, who passed a whole autumn and winter asleep; the people who got drunk at the feast of Venus Apaturia and, according to Eudemus, slept for many days; and \[the sleep\] of Epimenides of Crete. While looking for a sheep, he went into a cave during the midday heat, was overcome by deep sleep, and slept, according to Pausanias, for 77 years, (67, according to Eudemus, and slightly fewer, according to others). Later on he woke up, thought he had had forty winks, and began to look for his little sheep. Perhaps there is a natural explanation for why these people slept, although in the case of Epimenides I should rather attribute it to an evil spirit. The sleep of the demi-gods of Sardis was a fairy-story, because these people were actually dead. They seemed to be sleeping and to be woken up because of a conjuring-trick by evil spirits. One kind of long sleep \[such as this has sometimes happened because of a miracle and has been sent by God, examples being that of the seven holy sleepers, (see Laurent Sauer), and that of five others, (see Paul the Deacon).

The final point I mentioned \[in my initial question\] was about going without food. There can be no doubt the Devil is able to cause someone to go without food for many months because this is something which can happen naturally, and Indians say that they drive away hunger with the help of the herb Coca which they keep in their mouth, (Pedro Cieza, History of Peru Part 1, chapter 96 and Agustin de Zárate, History of Peru Book 1, chapter 8). In his Epitome, the heir to Dioscorides, \[Pietro\] Mattioli, also writes as follows. \'The Scythians have found a Scythian herb growing round Boeotia. It is very sweet to the taste and they are full of praise for it because when they have it in their mouth, they feel neither hunger nor thirst. Something they call \"hippice\" is excellent and produces the same effect in horses, too. With these herbs, it is said, Scythians can go for twelve days without food and without feeling thirsty\'. \[Cornelius\] Gemma acknowledges that abstinence from food can last naturally over a period of many years.

In his book on flesh, Hippocrates denies that hunger can be prolonged naturally beyond the seventh day. He should be understood \[as saying\] that the stomach and hungry intestine are devoid of chylous humour into which natural heat can go, and the usual result is that the intestine increases in size and so people die. But if, either from the malady I have just mentioned or from another cause, a raw, sluggish, viscous phlegmatic humour is left behind in the body, the \[body\'s\] natural heat uses it as nourishment until every bit of the humour is consumed. The same thing will happen if, out of the moisture at the top of the brain, a kind of thin material full of phlegm descends from the head into the body and during that time serves the body as nourishment, because under those circumstances anything which would be exhaled or would flow from the body would be restored by this humour which would be continually changed into nourishment, and so the person would not need food until this humour was entirely consumed.

I should think this was the reason for the abstinence from food and \'nonimbibing, (as Plautus puts it), of Roger Bacon\'s English girl who, he said, ate nothing for twenty years. \[It also explains\] the French priest who abstained from all food and drink for two years in the time of Pope Nicholas v, and the girl from Speyer who, on the orders of Emperor Ferdinand, was closely watched and observed by many physicians in 1540 to see if it was true that, after a serious illness, she had already persisted in abstaining from food for more than four years, but was still physically strong and healthy and had not lost weight, and her body was merely covered in phlegmatic scurf. (She would, however, frequently burst into tears). She had the usual dirt in her nostrils and ears, and she used to sleep and stay quiet for quite a long time. But she did not discharge faeces or urine either from her anus or from her female parts. This gave rise to a great deal of argument-among the Italians, by Simone Porzio, and among the Germans by an eye-witness, one of the physicians who was observing the girl, Gerhard Buchholtz. If these things can happen naturally, why can\'t that jackof-all-trades, the Devil, carry them out with the same industriousness \[he uses\] to engraft other perverse states of mind on the body? (I shall point this out in connection with a girl from Arabia, from \[a work\] by St Prosper \[of Aquitaine\], in Book 6, chapter 2, section 3.
[Page 108]

One has to be very careful, however, not to put the fasts of holy people, which pass the bounds of Nature, into this category: for example, \[those\] of St Mary of Egypt, St Catherine of Siena, St Lutgarde \[of Aywières\], St Marie of Oignies, St Catherine the Wonderful, (see \[Laurent\] Sauer), and of St Simon Stock, the Carmelite, whom the Mother of God fed with heavenly manna for six years, (see Menaud des Rosiers and Roland Bouchier on his life). God, you see, who created them, sustained them at that time without physical food by His power. (See the remarks on these points in \[Gianfrancesco\] Pico della Mirandola, Foreknowledge of Things Book 3, chapter 5). Roger Bacon, however, irreligiously ascribes all this to influxes from the stars. If he is right, why do the stars which send their influx down to everyone in general bestow this ability to do without food simply on one person and not on someone else? Is it because the body of this person alone has been disposed in this particular way? But what is this disposition which is the only one to give passage to the influx? What great force and inflexibility in others \[is designed\] to keep it out? Still, I have already spent enough time elsewhere on the nonsense in Bacon\'s work which needs to be rebutted. (On this drawn-out abstinence from food, see Giglio \[Gregorio\] Giraldi, Dialogue 17. You can find this in \[Jan\] Gruter\'s Critical Thesaurus.

Book 2, Question 22

Can magical practices, with the help of evil spirits, change one sex into another?

I am not talking about removal of parts of the body-I have done this alreadybut about the actual change of male sex into female, or female into male. In his Cosmocratic Art, Book 1, \[Cornelius\] Gemma, based on what contemporary physicians say, acknowledges that such a change can happen naturally: \'We read that many men have been made out of women\'. In Book 6, Part 8 of his Epidemics, Hippocrates writes that in Abdera, Pitheus\'s wife, Phaetusa, was very near giving birth when her husband was sent into exile. For several months her menstrual flow ceased, she endured great pains in every part of her body, and her physical appearance changed into that of a man. Her body became manlike, (\'owµa ávδpwIn\'), she turned hairy all over, grew a beard, and her voice became quite rough. The same thing happened in Thrace to Gorgippus\'s wife, Anamisia, and in Book 42 Livy says the same thing happened to a woman from Spoleto during the second Punic war.

Pliny (Book 7, chapter 4) says, \'Transformation of females into males is not a fairy-story. I have discovered in the annals that during the consulship of Publius Licinius Crassus and Gaius Cassius Longinus \[171BC\], a girl was changed into a boy under \[the eyes\] of her parents and, at the augurs\' order, was taken away to an uninhabited island. Licinius Mucianus has recorded that he himself saw a man called Arescon in Argos, who used to be called Arecusa. She had actually married a man, but then grew a beard, produced a man\'s organs of generation, and married a woman. \[Mucianus\] also says he saw a boy in Smyrna who had suffered the same fate. I myself saw a person in Africa who had turned into a man on the day of her marriage-Lucius Cossitius, a citizen of Thysdrus.

He was still alive while I was writing this\'. That is what Pliny writes. In his \[Attic\] Nights Book 9, chapter 4, Aulus Gellius says, \'In this collection of marvels, however, it is a good idea to note down something which Pliny the Elder, a man who had a great reputation in his own day because of his talent and position, recorded in the seventh Book of his Investigations into Nature-not something he had heard or read, but something he knew was true and something he himself had seen. The words I have quoted below are his own, taken from that Book, and they certainly make one hesitate to reject or ridicule the ancient poets\' very well-known song about Caenis and Caeneus\'. This is what Gellius says, substituting the words used earlier by Pliny; and when he talks about \'this wonder\' \[miraculosum\], he has used the word in its broad sense to refer to what is unusual and wonderful. (One should read Ovid\'s Metamorphoses on Caenus and Tiresias.)
[Page 109]

But what need is there for fairy-stories when histories are sufficient? In the last chapter \[31\] of Book 3 of The City of God, St Augustine, using pagan writings, mentions that women have been changed into men and hens into the male sex. (Later on, from Ausonius, I shall confirm the same of birds). Still, let me continue to talk about human beings. I come to a period closer to our own. In his History of Naples, Gioviano Pontano tells the story of a woman in Gaeta who was married to a fisherman for fourteen years and changed into a man: and another woman, called Emilia, who had been married to Antonio Spensa, a citizen of Eboli, changed into a man after twelve years of marriage, dissolved their union, married a woman, and procreated children. \[Pontano\] adds that another woman, having borne one son to her husband, suddenly grew male organs of generation and, not being a woman any longer, left her husband, married another woman, and got children by her.

Coccio Sabellico tells several similar stories about a number of people. I shall omit these and record two which have happened in Spain in my own time. They have been very faithfully recorded in Spanish by my countryman, Antonio de Torquemada. Amato Lusitano is the source \[of the following\]. In the town of Esgueira in Portugal, nine leagues from Coimbra, there lived a man of good family who had a daughter called Maria Pacecho. When she was of the age at which she would begin to menstruate, a male member burst from her places instead of a fluid humour-it had either lain hidden inside her or came out of her in some other fashion-and so a post-pubertal young man suddenly appeared out of the girl. When she became a man, she also took the name Manoel Pacecho. He went on board ship, set out for India, performed brave deeds, acquired the reputation of being an active soldier, as well as great wealth, and on his return to his own country, took as his wife a woman of good family. Amato makes no mention of children, but says he remained beardless, and that his face had a feminine look to it-signs that his manliness was not altogether complete.

Secondly, Torquemada tells us he had heard from a friend, a man with a considerable reputation and who was entirely trustworthy, that not far from the city of Beneventana in Spain, the wife of a peasant who was moderately well-off was treated in less than kindly fashion by her husband because she was barren. Sick of being treated badly, she ran away one night, dressed as a male house-servant and, thus accoutred, she passed herself off as a man in various places and earned her living by working as a servant. After some time, either because the natural heat \[she had\] inside her would have this power, or because her imagination, produced and strengthened by her continually wearing men\'s clothes and doing men\'s work, acquired this power, the fact is she discovered she had turned into a man. So, having been a wife for a long time, she decided to act as a husband and joined herself in matrimony to a woman. Her secret remained hidden for a long time because \'he\' did not dare to tell it to anyone, until somebody who had known her very well before noticed that her face was very similar to that of the peasant\'s wife who had run away. He asked whether, by chance, she was the woman\'s brother, and she told him the whole story, just as it had happened, and this is how it came to light.

\[Battista\] Fregoso writes the following. \'During the reign of Ferdinand I of Naples, Ludovico Guarna, a citizen of Salerno, brought up five daughters. The two oldest were called Francesca and Carola, and when they reached the age of fifteen, both girls\' genitalia burst out into what one expects of men. They changed the way they dressed and were considered to be men and took the names Francesco and Carolo. Likewise, in Eboli, during the same king\'s reign, there was a girl who had been betrothed to a man for four years already. On the first night of her marriage, when she went to bed with her husband and, either because of the vigorous friction or for some other unknown reason, the membranes which made her look like a woman were broken and men\'s parts came out. She went home, sued for a return of her dowry, and thereafter was considered to be a man\'.
[Page 110]

I have set these \[anecdotes\] in front of you so that Phlegon\'s narrative may seem less incredible. He says, \'A young woman called Philotis, who was born in Smyrna, was given in marriage by her parents to a man once she had reached \[the appropriate\] age, but produced a male member and turned into a man. In Laodicea, which is in Syria, too, there was a woman called Aeteta, and while she was actually having sex with her husband she turned into a man and called herself Aetetus. \[This happened\] when Macrinus was Governor of Athens and Lucius Lamia and Aelianus the Elder were consuls in Rome\'. (Phlegon, one of Hadrian\'s freedmen, adds that he has seen this person). In Book 1, chapter 21 of his Essays, Michel de Montaigne testifies that in his own time there was a girl in Vitry le François called Marie. She was dancing rather energetically when, all of a sudden, male organs burst out of her, and she was changed into a man. During the sacrament of confirmation, the Bishop of Soissons gave her the name \'Germain\', and this is what people started to call her. Later on, a beard grew on her chin. She lived a long time-into very old age-but never married. \[Montaigne\] attributes the change to her vivid imagination, but I add that her physical constitution was tending in that direction.

The author of Antimaeologium writes that \'in Auch in Gascony he had seen a man of sixty years and more, grey-headed, strong, with a full head of hair, who had been a girl up to the age of fifteen. But in the end, it so happened that when her thin ligaments burst and her pudenda emerged, she changed her sex, since she had never menstruated before\'. (See André du Laurens in his Anatomical Account, Book 7, question 8). Physicians-Galen in The Customary Usage of Parts \[of the Body\], and his book on the ways in which the anatomy is configured, Aegineta, Avicenna, al-Razi, and the rest-also point out that the reason Nature causes this to happen is not obscure. She is always aiming at what is more perfect.

A woman is like a monster, a kind of incomplete man. When her periods are held back for too long, her voice becomes rather strong, her skin turns hairy, and the rest of her physical condition gains strength; and all this transformation lacks is the outward appearance of the seminal vessels which are inside her. When it has grown and the fatty covering in which it has been wrapped has been broken, the thing which is called \'myrtle\', \'bride\', xantwpis xai inódepuis \[clitoris and prepuce\], and abathara or al-bandar in Arabic, is pushed out into a penis, which it closely resembles, and, having been wrapped up before, is now thrust out by an impulse from \[the body\'s\] pressing natural heat.

That is what those people say, but I have the very strong suspicion that these women turned into men not so much because they were lacking female attributes as because their male gender was close to their female gender, the result being that they were formed as hermaphrodites, with the male gender predominant, and this is why they were taken to be men. After I had written this many years ago, this year, 1606, I came across André du Laurens\'s painstaking work, Anatomical Account, and I was extremely pleased because it seemed to me that in \[Book 7\], question 8 this very learned physician carefully shows that the common opinion of physicians about a sex-change lying hidden in a woman is untrue, and that the genitalia of both genders are quite different not only in where they are located, but also in number, shape, and structure. In connection with this change he adds, \'In my opinion this is unnatural and scarcely credible, and if it does happen sometimes, it is very likely that the genitalia of both sexes exist in them.
[Page 111]

During the early years they lie hidden because \[the person\'s natural\] heat is weak, but in the end they burst out through the Èxháuxes \[\'shiners\'\] which have become prominent and shine forth; or one\'s thought has to be that there are some women who are very hot from the moment they are born and Nature encourages them in such a way that she reproduces the shape of their clitoris as a penis, and in consequence it sticks out and is distended like a penis, \[then\] becomes flaccid, and \[so\] counterfeits a man\'s generative organ and deceives those who are rather ignorant. Midwives frequently make a mistake \[about a child\'s sex\] because of the faulty formation of its genitalia-namely, when the penis is rather short and quite deeply concealed, as though in a cleft, and the testes are hidden away-and in consequence they can scarcely distinguish \[the child\'s\] sex. \[Séverin\] Pineau writes that in Paris in 1577 in the Rue Saint-Denis a woman gave birth at night to a son who was hastily baptised because he was weak, and was called Jeanne, as though he were a girl. After a few days, first his mother, then \[other people\] realised, not without great astonishment, that she was a son and gave him the name Jean. It is therefore easy to deceive the common people, who are rather ignorant.

That\'s what Du Laurens says. In Book 8, question 1 he tells us that Nature intends to produce women no less than she does men, and that it is unworthy of a natural philosopher to say that a female is a mistake and a lapse of Nature. Every perfection in the natural world has to be gauged from its goal, and the female is formed the way she is because otherwise the human race could not be preserved. Certainly, people say that a female is something unnatural, \[but\] I have always thought they are not being particularly respectful about the creation of the first woman. So, one ought to say that Nature is always reaching for what is more complete, not because she always intends to produce a man, but because when she turns her attention to a man, she intends to produce something which is entirely complete, and when \[she turns her attention to a female, she is also trying to make her entirely complete. Nevertheless, if Nature could do what so many authors claim, I should think that, with God\'s permission, that very cunning individual, \[the Devil\], relying on natural causes, can do it as well. Certainly, I should be happy to attribute to him those fictitious miracles which pagans attribute to their false divinities. Phlegon tells the same story about Caerneus, the Lapith, as Ovid does; Antoninus Liberalis, quoting Book 2 of Nicander\'s Metamorphoses, writes about more of them: Hypermnestra was sold for her value as a woman and later the gods, as a gift, changed her into a man; Siproeta, a Cretan, became a man when she saw Minerva washing; Galatea wrongly called her daughter Leucippus when she should have been called Leucippa, but when she changed sex, by the kindness of Phaetian Latona, she deserved the name her mother had given her.

Second conclusion: I have to believe that it is impossible for Nature and for an evil spirit to make a woman out of a man. This attempt was made in the case of Sporus by Nero who was utterly devoted to magic, but without any success. It was done by extreme withdrawal of his completed parts into female places, and I do not understand how Nature would degrade \[someone\] this way. I do know that Phlegon told his story about Tiresias in line with fairy-stories, and that Antoninus Liberalis had his doubts when he talked about Siproeta, with the result that you scarcely know which sex she changed from and which sex she changed into. If you also read carefully the whole of Ausonius\'s epigram from Book 1, you should pay attention to what he said about the man who degenerated into the female sex.
[Page 112]

\'A male bird turns into the female of his kind. And a pea-hen who was a peacock stands before your eyes Nor is \[the story\] particularly ancient which \[says that\] in Campanian Benevento One of their young men suddenly became a young woman\', \[69.3-4, 13-14\].

He says a girl was made from a boy and a pea-hen from a peacock, but I don\'t believe it-or at least I find it very difficult to believe. I should have said, rather, that they had both sexes in them, one hidden, the other obvious. In this connection, I also refer to the hare, and to the hyaena which Ovid talks about.

\'We may be surprised that \[the sexes switch, and that a \[female\] hyaena which recently Allowed a male \[hyaena\] to mate with her is now a male\'.

Unless I am mistaken, Pliny recorded that she was endowed with both sexes, Book 8.

Book 2, Question 23

Can an evil spirit give an old man back his youth?

There is no force or power which can bring it about that an old man can cease to be old and be young, or not have reached the age he has reached. Who can give back something which has been done, \[as though\] it had not been done and which has slipped away completely in a succession of things which have happened? But am I bold enough to decide that if God allows him \[to do so\], an evil spirit can cause someone who is already bent, enfeebled, and decrepit with age to regain his strength, and the appearance and sheen of youth: his grey hairs to be changed into a better colour: his cold to a gentle warmth and his torpor into activeness, so that his body can get back everything else of which old age had deprived him? Plainly I do not think what poets relate at all.

Aeschylus wrote about a ram changed into a lamb, and Bacchus\'s nurses renewing their youth. Pherecydes, Simonides, and Lycophron wrote about Jason who was rejuvenated by Medea, and the Greek author of Returns and the Latin poet \[Ovidius\] Naso in his Metamorphoses wrote about Jason\'s father, Aeson. What they say, however, is entirely untrue and repugnant to Nature, since it took place after all his blood had been drawn off through a wound and fresh \[blood\] substituted. It follows, therefore, that the body of a living man first died and was then resuscitated, and this is something reserved to the omnipotence of God. The rest of what \[Ovid\] was talking about could perhaps have happened because of the health-giving potion he drank.

\'His beard and hair Laid aside their greyness and seized hold of the colour black. His thinness was routed and fled; his pallor and mustiness went away; His hollow wrinkles were filled with increased flesh; His body became wanton. Aeson was astonished and remembered That he was like this forty years ago\', \[Metamorphoses 7.288-293\].

Everyone says-and it cannot in good faith be denied-that the eagle renews its youthfulness. The divine writer of hymns testified \[to it\]: \'Your youth will be renewed, like that of the eagle\'. Everyone says, \'it is renewed\', although the way it happens does not agree with our \[writers\] and \[those of\] the Jews. A verse in Isaiah is relevant to the same thing. \'Those who hope in the Lord will alter their strength and receive wings, as eagles do\'. The same thing benefits snakes which, (as everyone says), are base and mean in character, with the result that they strip off old age along with that thin \'slough\' of theirs and clothe themselves in youth. Why does our step-mother Hebe \[goddess of youth\] cut off all hope of this kindness from humankind right at the start, such as all the hope which was removed because of the ignorance of the carrier-ass which allowed a snake to drink such a health-giving drug sent to human beings by Jupiter?
[Page 113]

Why can\'t we find natural remedies which are as effective as this? Many, of course, have not yet been discovered and are unknown to humans, although they are known to evil spirits. Restoration of fundamental moisture, moderation of the excessive dryness of old age, substitution of a better sap for the one which has been spoiled, making good everything else which has been ruined and everything necessary for this transformation-none of this is contrary to the law of Nature. Changing the colour of hair is not impossible, either. Many people have recorded seeing white crows.

Finally, there is no shortage of witnesses who confirm the metamorphosis I am now defending. You can read two examples in Torquemada. In Tarento in 1531, there was a centenarian ready for the grave, whose hair was falling out, whose skin was peeling off, and whose nails were dropping out in the wasting away and foulness of old age. But everything changed for the better and from being an old man, he became young \[again\] and lived a further fifty years. In the Castilian part of Rioja, too, a similar thing happened to someone and was very well known because everyone was talking about it, and it was carefully investigated by the chief magistrates of Castile. Monvendro is a town, (once called Sagunto), in the Kingdom of Valencia. Valesco de Tarenta writes that during his lifetime there was an abbess of a convent here who, already a dry-bones, suddenly began to menstruate again. Her teeth grew back, her hair turned dark, the wrinkles and folds in her skin filled out, her pendulous, shrivelled breasts swelled up like those of a young girl, and in the end her features, face, and entire bodily carriage made her look like a young woman. As a result, shocked by the novelty of her situation, out of modesty she began to withdraw from everyone\'s gaze.

What more \[can I say\]? More recent, very trustworthy, writers on Portuguese history give us a long, well-established narrative about an Indian of good family who lived for three hundred and forty years during which the flower of his youth withered three times and blossomed again three times; and there is no lack of people who testify that in the New World there is an island called Bonica on which there flows a spring whose water, more precious than wine, restores youth to old people when they drink it. Pedro Cieza, however, not without good reason, includes a narrative, which originated in a healthier location in the region, about a similar spring on Lucaya: History of Peru Part 2, chapter 41. But whether such a spring flows on Bonica or Lucaya or both, I can easily see that some people find these \[stories\] incredible. But they should reflect. To withdraw one\'s trust in stories of this kind, which the rationality of a guided natural philosophy does not abhor, simply because you yourself have not seen any such thing, is a piece of remarkable impudence and shamelessness. Indeed, those who decide, simply on the basis of their own opinion or approbation, that something has or has not happened somewhere are more or less insane.

Suppose someone comes at this from the opposite direction-that God fixed a particular period for human life in advance and it cannot be prolonged naturally, at least not beyond a hundred and twenty years, as is proved by God\'s words, \'The days of humankind will be a hundred and twenty years\', \[Genesis 6.3\] and likewise by Moses who said, \'I am a hundred and twenty years old today, and I cannot go forward or back\', \[Deuteronomy 31.2\], and that this is confirmed by arithmetical calculation because this number is made up of three times forty, that is, four tens multiplied by three, and so when everything is added together it makes a complete whole-3x4x10.
[Page 114]

This argument is easily dealt with because God did not appoint one and the same period of life for all human beings, but one peculiar to each individual, and the fact is that once a term of life has been extended to them, their life cannot be prolonged naturally by this kind of transformation except with God\'s permission. If He does allow it, many people are agreed that it can surpass even a hundred and twenty years. Those words of God were not said about people of every generation, but only about those who were living at the time who were going to be given this limit as a penance before the Flood. Nor in what he said did Moses claim that he could not live for longer, only that he was unable and unfitted in his dotage to cope with the management of such a large number of people. The argument from numbers I mentioned earlier is one which Francisco Vallés found surprisingly satisfying, to such an extent that he thought he should pursue it at very great length. In fact, however, it is worthless and of no importance because numbers exercise no influence at all upon the human constitution, and our life does not depend on numbers, but on primary and secondary natural causes.

Another argument of this kind is advanced quite forcefully. Human life is preserved by natural moisture, and this keeps on being used up over one\'s lifetime. The power of food to nourish is impaired because it suffers in its turn from our activity and, in the opinion of experienced physicians, the nourishing \[power\] of food cannot restore as much \[energy\] as an old person loses. It is therefore necessary, because of the state of \[old\] age, that that moisture which is starting to be used up entirely, be refreshed quickly, and that the individual\'s proper measure of it, which has decayed and started to age, be restored. I am happy concede this much to those \[who put forward this argument\]. But, they say, physicians think this cannot be done by \[medical\] skill or by Nature. My reply to them is that although the underlying knowledge of how to restore fundamental moisture has perhaps remained unknown to physicians so far, it does not follow from that that it is unknown to an evil spirit, or is something he cannot \[know\], because if he does know it, why can he not, with God\'s permission, put it into practice and make use of his knowledge?

Perhaps you will urge that he could therefore keep a human being alive for ever and thus make him, as it were, immortal. That Egyptian windbag against whom Galen wrote kept on suggesting this, but I am arguing against it and deny the chain of reasoning. It is possible to extend life for many years. Therefore it is possible to extend it for ever because, although a long-lived human being remains subject to death-just as he was also going to be before \[original\] sin, and just as, by the mere will of God, (according to certain people\'s opinion), he then escaped death-so too according to the hypothesis of this argument, if God were to permit an evil spirit to keep on restoring his fundamental moisture, the human being would not then die because under those circumstances God, by means of such a dispensation, would deliver him from the necessity of dying. Secondly, if you take away this particular dispensation, I say it does not look as though God will ever permit this. At length, after several hundred years, the natural force in a human being would perish and be exhausted, and the result would be that no natural remedies an evil spirit could use would be enough to end up restoring the very tottering physical bulk of a constitution which had been, as it were, overthrown. But this would not happen except after a very long time. These points, therefore, do not contradict at all what I said about life\'s being prolonged, not perpetuated. So that you can see the fault in \[these people\'s\] chain of reasoning, consider the \'tree of life\' or, as the Jews call it, \'the timber of lives\'. This tree would produce life in the flower of youth, after \[someone\] had eaten \[its fruit\], and this would last for a period equivalent to many long lives these days. Very eminent writers have justly said that the \[tree\] had this power naturally and that it retained it after humankind\'s \[original\] sin. This is clear from Genesis 3, verse 22 where God builds a wall round Paradise so that Adam cannot enter it again and take \[fruit\] from the tree of life so that he could live for ever. Nevertheless, these same learned men have told us that this tree could not, on that account, have preserved humankind from death for ever.
[Page 115]

I have said this in order to point out the fault, as far as this subject is concerned, in the chain of reasoning \[which says\] that it is possible to prolong life for a long time and that therefore it would be possible \[to prolong it\] for ever.

Those who grant that the tree of life could have kept prolonging life, you see, do not grant that it could have done so in perpetuity, nor has anyone brought a charge against them on this account. Otherwise, the very learned men of this age disagree about what power the tree had and whether the \'for ever\' of Genesis 3, verse 22 should be interpreted specifically as referring to eternal life or to a very long life. I follow those who have interpreted it as referring to eternal life, excluding death completely.

Book 2, Question 24.

What power does magic, or an evil spirit, have over a soul which is joined to a body and is animating it?

There are three powers of the soul. I have already said what \[an evil spirit\] can do with respect to the vegetative and sensitive \[powers\] as far as the exterior senses are concerned.

\(i\) He can certainly deceive the sight, the hearing, and the rest of the senses, as is proved by numberless exemplary stories by other people.

\(ii\) An evil spirit uses the internal sense as an instrument to assail or strive against the powers of the soul because he can deceive the fourfold working of the internal sense by throwing the \[passive\] imagination \[phantasia\] into confusion. The general opinion of theologians is that angels cannot change the \[active\] or the \[passive\] imagination by imprinting a new mental impression \[species\] on it, and therefore they cannot cause someone who has been blind from birth to have a correct mental image of the colours of things. But angels can perfectly well fashion some passively imaginary object \[phantasticum\], cast it in front of the eyes, and so thrust that semblance \[of reality\] upon them or, with the help of the \[active\] imagination, mix and jumble together the images of things a person has once seen, and manufacture images of things he has never seen-a chimaera, for example, which is a conflation of a she-goat, a lion, and a snake, or a mountain of silver, \[which is a mixture\] of a mountain and silver; or, once they have stirred up movements and feelings in the body so that the \[passive\] imagination is affected, they have even willed happy things, or sad, which the human has not seen and which have never existed; or, just as one sees in mad or frenzied individuals, they observe the different images of their \[passive\] imagination, caused by the disorder of their humours.

This is how, by adopting vapours suitable for what he has in mind and applying them to an uneven mixture of those same humours, and agitating them, an evil spirit can cause a human being to draw from them any mental images he \[the spirit\] wants and decide he is seeing and hearing things which, in fact, he has never taken in with his eyes or ears. It is from this cause that so many false apparitions, revelations, and ecstasies flow, as we are told by St Augustine, The Care One Should Have for the Dead, chapter 12; \[Francisco de Vitoria, Lectures \[on Theology\], section 35, \'On Magic\', (this makes a reply to the second point); José Anglés, question 3, doubt 5; Fr \[Luis de\] Molina, Commentaries on St Thomas \[Aquinas\], article 3. There is usually power in herbs, if what the botanist \[Pietro\] Mattioli says is true, because in his \'Dedicatory Letter\' he writes as follows.

Democritus mentions achaemenis, an amber-coloured plant without leaves, which grows among the Tradictyli in India. Its root is divided into little lozenges, and when criminals drink it in wine they confess all \[their crimes\] because of the tortures \[they suffer\] at night on account of their delusive imaginings \[that they are seeing\] divine spirits. Adamantis comes from Cappadocia and Armenia. When it is given to lions, they immediately lie on their backs and start breathing heavily. It is said that the origin of the name lies in the fact that, like steel \[adamas\], the plant cannot be crushed. Ophiusa is said to grow in Elephantine in Aethiopia. It has a leaden hue and looks dreadful, and when people drink it, they are terrified by the sight of snakes threatening them, the result of which is that, out of fear, they decide to kill themselves. This is why those guilty of sacrilege are forced to drink it. The antidote to it is palm wine. The story is that potamantis is found on the banks of the River Indus, and if people drink it they are driven mad because of the extraordinary things they see.
[Page 116]

(According to Dioscorides, if you drink an eighth of an ounce of the root of manic nightshade in wine, it makes you see various sights and images which are not pleasant). Theangelis grows on Mt. Lebanon in Syria, and if people eat it, they can foretell the future. Gelotophyllis grows in Bactria and along the \[River\] Borysthenes. If this is drunk along with wine and myrrh, they say one sees various things and cannot stop laughing until one drinks palm wine to which pine-nuts, pepper, and honey have been added. (Crateuas says that if oenothera is tied to their throat or hung from their collar, it tames the wild behaviour of all living things.) Appian of Alexandria writes that when the Parthians, who had been put to flight by Antony, were hard-pressed by hunger, and came across a certain herb, those who ate it would not remember or understand anything else at all, but would keep on digging up stones as though they were about to undertake some great task and then, raving and vomiting up bile, they would die\'. All this, it is clear, happened because their imagination had been damaged.

\(iii\) The Devil can and does, every day, unsettle the \[physical\] spirits \[spiritus and humours of the body\'s organs, and its internal sense, and throws into confusion the organs of the faculty of lust and anger, while at the same time disturbing the physical parts of \[a person\'s\] body. \[He does this in such a way that thoughts of various sins arise from this \[confusion\]. He does not do this by sending a new image to the \[active\] imagination, you see, or even the thought itself by forming it together with the feeling \[it provokes\]. He simply makes the potentiality \[of committing sin\] happen at the same time as the sight of the object, and thus prompts images which stimulate a memory of pleasures, as well as exciting and stirring up the members of generation and their seed, as the magician Marcus tells us in Psellus.

Since this sensory appetite lacks freedom and is drawn forcibly towards its object by a particular kind of compulsion, it is inevitable that the Old Fox can push it into doing something wicked, so much so that the sensory appetite is unable to gain that object. A movement of this kind, however, is entirely devoid of sin and when our will strongly resists it, we are given an opportunity of \[achieving\] greater merit and reward. This should be noted carefully so that \[Johann\] Godelmann, \[Lambert\] Daneau, and other heretics may not deceive anyone when they ascribe these movements of lust to sin and also, (which is quite ridiculous), include someone who does not want \[to sin\] and is actively resisting it. But these are the results of denying free will and misunderstanding the character of original sin.

\(iv\) An evil spirit can assist the memory by adapting its organ to receive images more easily and retain them for longer, either using local motion to drive away things which are harmful \[to his purpose\], or by applying things which are helpful to it. He can impair it a great deal by methods which cause conflict \[within it\], as Theodas did in the Life of Barlaam and Josaphat by \[John of\] Damascus. I think that Aethalides had this kind of memory, (\[Diogenes\] Laertius, Life of Pythagoras = 8.\[4\]), as did Apollonius of Tyre, (Suidas praises it), and a German cleric had an inability to remember \[stemming\] from this kind \[of demonic interference\], (\[Battista\] Fregoso, Exemplary Stories Book 1, chapter 6). Another lengthy period of forgetfulness happened to the Englishman, Simon Thurway. \[His memory\] drained away because of God\'s just punishment.

He was a very clever logician and had a great reputation as Professor of the Liberal Arts in Paris, \[but\] he was filled more with knowledge which puffs a man up than with charity which edifies and was not afraid to boast in the Schools that he knew the whole of Christ\'s law and could demolish it by overruling it. But he was struck so suddenly by forgetfulness that he could not remember his basic letters, could not recite the Lord\'s Prayer, and did not know how to read. While Nicholas of Durham was still a young man, he saw him being taught his letters by his own son, and \'\[Nicholas\]\', says Matthew Paris in Book 7 of his History of the English, \'told me about it while I was writing this\'. It happened in about 1201. (Trithemius says that Simon came from Tournai, but he is wrong because \[Simon\] was an Englishman from Cornwall. He is also mentioned in Book 15 of Polydore \[Vergil\'s\] History of England).
[Page 117]

Perhaps God induced this forgetfulness in this instance by sending it into him at the hands of a wicked angel. The Wicked One could also, (as I said), help the memory with natural remedies, as a physician does, \[or\] by giving advice, as a choir-master does, with professional skill and instructions, \[and\] just as, in our own times, there exist tracts by many people who have professed, without superstition, some technique \[to help\] the memory. Among these uneducated works is Thamus, by Alexander Dickson Arelius. It is obscure, but not without wit and shrewdness, and has been defended, (but not with the same cleverness), against biters from Cambridge by Heius Scepsius. (It was published in Leiden).

\(v\) He can improve the understanding and make it more acute as far as the workings of one\'s natural ability and judgement are concerned by making the ways in which the organ is disposed more serviceable, namely, by using to local motion to dispel the denser humours, or by applying natural agents as remedies, or by purging the sensual parts of the \[physical\] spirit \[spiritus\] and drawing them to the organs by the second of the ways I mentioned, or by multiplying those same spirits \[spiritibus\] by purifying the blood. The more, the better, the more purgative the spirits \[spiritus\] are, and the better and more free from impediments the organs of the internal sense are, inevitably the more unimpeded and more productive the understanding becomes. These, however, are, so to speak, the special gifts of good angels. Evil spirits \[mali daemones\] on the other hand, love to pour darkness into human minds by making the humours dense and the \[physical\] spirits \[spiritus\] few, weak, and impure.

They give their followers mischievous drugs by means of which they rob people of their right mind, just as not uncommonly they do in the case of those whom they have obsessed. They lead people astray with wicked suggestions, falsely persuading them of various things: at one time saying that something is illicit, and at another that in fact it is allowed; or that something is a grave sin when actually it is venial, (the intention here being to torture people with scruples); or inculcating the idea that things which are contrary to divine and human laws are actually lawful; or saying that things are contemptible and trivial when in fact they are lethal and ought to make one very afraid, (this being done to make people\'s consciences lax and wanton).

Perhaps you will ask whether an evil spirit can teach the arts and sciences. There should be no doubt at all that he can if he wants \[to do so\] and if God gives him permission. \[He can\] certainly do so by speaking and giving visible expression to what he has in mind, not only by appearing in visible form and speaking to someone, (which St Thomas \[Aquinas\] does not deny he can do), but also by speaking and making suggestions \[to someone\] internally after \'illuminating\' his understanding. I do not see why this \'illumination\', which has an evil goal in view, should not be attributed to an evil spirit, since this \[kind of\] realisation has nothing to do with God and is not done with any genuine cleansing of the mind. Consequently, whether it should be called an illumination or an illusion, or whether it should be called something else such as, (for example), an unadorned manifestation of the truth, is undoubtedly going to be a question of nomenclature. In \[Laurent\] Sauer\'s Life of St Norbert, \[Volume 3\], chapter 27, under \'6th June\', \[an evil spirit\] made one uneducated person very skilled in Holy Scripture. Today we know that many Anabaptists, by consuming a great deal of Scripture rather than food, and learning it by heart, think that what they receive is also a suitable way to confirm their errors. Who, other than the Devil, tells them this?
[Page 118]

Johannes Nider has left us a passage about the initiation of vampire-witches \[lamiarum\], and in this \[passage\] there is a confession by one of them. \'We lay siege to little children who have not yet been baptised, or even to those who have been baptised, especially if they are not protected by the sign of the cross and prayers. We kill them with our rituals while there are in their cradles or lying beside their parents, and afterwards it is thought they have been smothered or have died in some other way. We take them secretly from their graves, boil them down in a cauldron until the flesh has almost entirely come away from the bones and one can swallow it and drink it. From the more solid part of this matter, we make an ointment which is suitable for what we want to do-our \[magical\] practices and our shape-changing. We fill a flask or a bottle with the runnier humour, and once anyone has drunk any of this, to the accompaniment of a few rituals, he immediately becomes a participant in and a master of our sect\', \[The Ant-Hill 5.3\] This is the confession of a woman. It is followed by another which seems to be that of a man. It adds the other ceremonies used in their abominable initiation and advancement to the hellish office of \'Master\'. This is the order in which I was led astray. First, on Sunday, before the holy water is blessed, the person who is about to become an apprentice enters the church with the Masters \[of the craft\] and there, in front of them, he denies Christ, his faith, his baptism, and the Catholic Church. Next, he pays homage to the \"Magisterulus\", that is, \"the Little Master\", which is the only title they use for the evil spirit, and finally he drinks from the bottle I mentioned earlier. Once he has done this, he immediately feels himself receiving and retaining a mental image of our craft and of the principal rituals of this sect. This is how I was led astray, as was my wife\', etc.

In these words, you see that what they are taught comes from what they drink. But the ignorant fellow was deceived when he thought a new image was being formed independently in his mind in which everything pertaining to the craft would be shown to him, divided into its separate categories. The evil spirit could not do this, nor was the magician\'s intellect capable of this kind of cognitive effort. These things were suggested by means of some kind of internal, very rapid suggested, and since the magician did not notice the speed of the suggestion, he thought he had learned simultaneously, and in an instant, things he had received one after the other in a very short space of time. \[An evil spirit\] can also form images in the air very rapidly and display them like this so that they can be seen by our \[passive\] imagination \[phantasiae\], with the result that our mind seems to be catching sight of them all in a single act of seeing, as in a mirror, and thus the inner person thinks he is being illuminated.

This was undoubtedly the stratagem whereby the ancient serpent tried unsuccessfully to deceive Ignatius, the founder of my Society. Let me write down the whole thing in the words of \[Pedro de\] Ribadaneira. \'But visions, which he saw in the midst of his studies\'-he is talking about grammatical studies\'began to disturb him very frequently and in large numbers. He wanted to commit to memory the inflections of nouns and verbs, but such a great abundance of divine thoughts started to pour into his mind that he was unable to learn anything new at all, and if anything had stuck in his memory before this, it started to flow away utterly and completely. Nor was he able either to prevent thoughts of this kind from coming, or to drive them away when they started, even though he zealously made every effort \[to do so\]. Shocked by the strangeness of the situation, he asked, why does this happen when I am praying, when I am making my confession and receiving the bread which transcends its substance, when I am awake, and when I scourge myself? When I survey all the spiritual gifts I receive from God, such frequent, such great, and such powerful \[moments of enlightenment do not present themselves to me. So, when I am engaged in doing unimportant things and am not thinking about God when I am close to God, why do such beautiful images and heavenly illuminations come to my mind? I recognise, I do recognise how clever this most troublesome Enemy is. I recognise the Old Fox\'s tricks and cunning\', etc. The \[Enemy\] got hold of Ignatius\'s mind, which had already long been actively engaged in receiving intimations of heavenly things, because he knew in advance that if Ignatius\'s teaching were to be consonant with his religious devotion it would threaten him \[the Enemy\] with a greater harm. So he tried, with this display of better doctrine, to make \[Ignatius\'s\] task of the learning the rudiments of letters ineffectual, \'at this time especially\', (as \[Giovanni\] Mattei says), \'offering his understanding frequent illuminations, and throwing light on the abstruse mysteries of Holy Scripture\'. If he could do this in the case of things which are very holy-a man\'s faith in and manifest love of God-how much more easily can one believe he has brought knowledge of things which are profane and untrue to the minds of those without faith?
[Page 119]

Chrysanthius of Sardis, who was a magician and High Priest \[of Lydia\] at the time of Julian the Apostate, had a son and although \[his son\] had no skill in the art of versification or any part of \[the art\] of grammar, with a single glance at the sun he would pour out prophecies against the Christians. Breathed on in the same way by the divinity who lights up the night, various shepherds suddenly became poets-Evages of Bithynia, for example, and others. Amphiaraus also became a poet this way, and the old woman who was taught Pindar\'s hymn, and evil spirits in the guise of old men clad in skins, who lived in her house and fulfilled the role of incubi, told Sosipatra everything which was done elsewhere behind her back, and taught her everything which had been written by poets, philosophers, and orators.

This is how the little creature who apes divinity tries to make \[people taught by God\] himself. For the most part, however, one discerns the knowledges he pours out because it does not last and a human being does not make use of it when and how he pleases, but only via inspiration or an ecstatic trance in certain places at certain times and because of specific causes. \[The knowledge\] which God pours out, on the other hand, is always and everywhere manifest, as is clear in the case of Solomon, (3 Kings \[3.9-12\]), the Apostles, (Acts \[2.1-4\]), Bezaliel, (Exodus 35. \[30.31\]), the man in St Jerome\'s letter to Domnio, (Book 2, letter 4), and Abbot Joachim who, from being an illiterate, uneducated door-keeper, drank a certain wine which had been brought to him by an angel, and suddenly emerged not only a prophet, but also in an instant a subtle debater and learned theologian. (Laonicus Chalcondyles tells us about him in Book 6 of his Turkish Affairs). People who are aútoðíðaxtoi \[self-taught\] should be distinguished from \[taught by God\] because they acquire their learning by their own effort, and not by having it poured into them \[from above\]-\[being learned in\] logic, for example, (St Augustine, Confessions Book 4), and theology (Athanasius, for whom see Nicephorus, History \[of the Church\] Book 5, chapter 44).

These examples, however, are superior to teaching received from the Devil. In March in the year, 1600, in accordance with the sentence of the Inquisitors of the Faith, the bones of one Román Ramírez, together with a statue, were burned to ashes in Toledo. Ramírez had died in prison while awaiting trial. He was accused, among other things, of having received skill in medicine from an evil spirit, and since this criminal united in his person many aspects of magic, I shall not regard it as a chore to translate the \[procurator\] fiscal\'s accusation faithfully from Spanish into Latin.

\(a\) He said \[Ramírez\] had already been accused of the Muslim error and had abjured it, but added that he had relapsed-which is what that kind of muck usually does-and returned to his vomit. For many years he had kept the great fast they call \'Ramadan\', and observed the rites and ceremonies of Muhammad by first saying \'guadoc\' and \'zála, washing his whole body, putting on a clean outer garment, reciting the \'azoras\', (i.e. prayers), of that sect with his face turned to \'al-quibla\', (i.e. the rising sun), raising and lowering his head and bowing himself to the ground, extending his palms upwards to the sky while he was saying \'Alaqueur\', (i.e. God is great), and rising before daybreak to celebrate the fast \'zahor. Thus absolved \[of his sins\], he solemnly celebrated his Easter, \[called\] \'Ramadan\', for three days. This he did by abstaining from all work and manual labour, especially on the first day, by putting on a clean outer garment, and by making the declaration \'guadoc\' and \'zála\', along with many other Muslim rites and ceremonies. Then, adding crime to crime and sin to sin, he revived the overt pact and treaty he had made with an evil spirit many years before with the intention of doing something wicked. He worshipped this evil spirit, did him homage, and dedicated his soul to him on condition he assist him with his favour and advice as often as he might be needed or asked in connection with anything at all. So Ramírez asked and obtained from the evil spirit knowledge of and expertise in how to cure many secret concealed illnesses with herbs, fumigations, and superstitious incantations: and, as a matter of fact, he cured not a few people this way.
[Page 120]

\(b\) He persuaded people he had a wide and detailed knowledge of literature, both sacred and profane, and so they would give him the titles of stories and he would-quite openly for money-recite them, more or less word for word, as though he were reading them from a book open in front of him, something he did with the help of his evil spirit. In this way he amassed not a little power because of the money he was given by his audiences, and when someone asked him how he had acquired such a reliable memory, he replied that someone very close to him, a person very knowledgeable about the properties of herbs, who had an evil spirit as a close friend, had given him some kind of drink. He also said that on one occasion, when this same person wanted to go to Saragossa, which was fifteen leagues away, he made an invocation-de bon varón, as they say-and a horse suddenly appeared. They both mounted it and very soon afterwards arrived at the city gates where they left the horse after removing its bridle. They then did the business which was the reason for their journey, returned to the gate, threw the bridle on the horse again, and were brought back home almost in an instant.

\(c\) There was an incident which took place in the town of Deza. A woman went to bed angry, (as it happened), and put herself in the hands of an evil spirit. Suddenly someone-she had no idea who-removed her from that place and because she had disappeared completely, her husband came to Ramírez and asked him for his help. Ramírez replied that the man should not be downcast, and that he would restore his wife to him. He gave him a letter and told him to go to a particular place among the vineyards, make a circle there, and stand in the middle of it, and when he heard a crowd of people passing by, even if he saw no one he was to ask, \'Where is the King going to be?\' If the answer was that the King was crossing by on that side, he should throw the letter to the ground in front of him \[self\]. The man did as he was told and got his wife back, although he did not see who had brought her back or how he had done it.

\(d\) The procurator fiscal added that \[Ramírez\] said a good many very obscure things, and things which had happened in places very far away, about which he could not have known anything at the time he was revealing them, except through his pact with an evil spirit. On one occasion, (said the fiscal), while Ramírez was leaving the house he said a traveller was about to come and ask and entreat him to come and free his daughter from an evil spirit which was obsessing her, and so they should summon him at once. The other man came and Ramírez was summoned. While he was curing the illness, Ramírez behaved in such a way that it seemed perfectly clear that an evil spirit had been dispatched against the sick woman beforehand through an act of harmful magic \[maleficio\] by Ramírez himself. \[People thought this\] because, first of all, on the day of her marriage the unfortunate girl had suffered a flux of blood together with a mental blackout and pressure round her heart; and not long afterwards she had frequent, long-lasting fainting fits, and began to hate her parents and her husband, and could not endure the sight of him or sleeping with him.

They came to the conclusion she was obsessed. A priest was sent for and for eighteen days he tried to drive away her wicked guest with exorcisms and the usual remedies of the Catholic Church. Finally, one evil spirit spoke up and said that a hundred and one evil spirits had been dispatched against the woman\'s body, but that now he was the only one because all the others had gone away. So when the priest began to repeat the usual exorcisms from the Church\'s servicebook and to urge him to say where the rest had gone, he replied they had left for the town of Deza to visit the foresaid Román Ramírez and ask him what he wanted them to do, and that they would not leave until he had given them permission to do so. At this point, the unfortunate girl was cruelly beaten to the floor and stayed there the whole day in a swoon. When the priest began to order him to stop harassing the woman and to let her live with her husband as a wife should, and to give her back a precious jewel he had stolen, \[the evil spirit\] replied that he was under Román\'s control and that he \[himself\] had the jewel but could not give it back. It was after this that the parents, affected by what the evil spirit said, had sent for Román Ramírez to cure their daughter.
[Page 121]

The moment he entered the house, the woman began to say and do extraordinary things, crying out that she knew he had come, but did not know why he had done so. Then, as he entered her room and she saw him, she fainted, her mouth became contorted, and she remained like this for three days, unable to eat or drink, having no power to swallow anything at all. So the magician drenched her with a strong suffumigation composed of \[smoke from\] burning shoe-leather, juniper oil, and other things, summoned her back from her fainting fit and then, addressing the spirit which was obsessing her, said, \'Leave her alone. Leave her alone and go away. Flee, unless you want me to repeat the suffumigation\'.

The evil spirit, however, was unwilling to reply, so Ramírez told everyone to leave the room and, thinking no one could hear him, started to question the spirit and demand, \'Why don\'t you answer me? The spirit which attended my grandfather had more humility! What have I done that you do not deign to speak to me? Isn\'t it enough that I have devoted myself to you entirely for such a long time? So now make this woman sleep so that she doesn\'t hear anything we say\'.

Meanwhile, another evil spirit arrived, and the accused said to him, \'You\'ve come at the right moment. What did you do while you were in Deza? How are my wife and children?\'

\'Your son\', said \[the evil spirit\], \'was not well, but he\'s now out of danger. Your wife was worse. She has now recovered. Your grandson is still sick, and there is a danger he may die.

Then Ramírez replied that since they knew he had served them faithfully every day, and how much he was bound to them, they were not unaware he was being pressed for a debt of two hundred reals as payment for a garden he had rented. It was fair, \[he said\], that they do him a favour and leave the obsessed woman\'s body, at least for the space of fifteen days, and leave her healthy and sound in the meantime, so that he could receive payment of a large fee and increase his future reputation and good character, which would otherwise receive a notable blow. After that, they could attack her again, and take possession of her as far as he was concerned. The evil spirit then promised he would do this and obey him. But when Ramírez noticed his conversation had been overheard by other people, and that he had been found out as someone who had power, so to speak, over an evil spirit, he became angry and threatened he would throw \[the evil spirit\] into chains, and the memory of this would make sure he would not dare do anything like that again.

The evil spirit was expelled, but because the woman\'s parents had not paid a large enough fee for what he had done, Ramírez threatened that they would soon need his help again. Immediately, he transferred the condition \[caused by\] his harmful magic \[maleficii\] into the husband of the woman who was now free and told his evil spirits to go into him and molest him. They did so and afflicted him very cruelly for the entire day, inspiring him with a thousand frightening mental images and temptations to despair. So, they sent for \[Ramírez\] again and when he came to the man he said, \'You have been struggling valiantly with an evil spirit, my friend\', then, employing suffumigations, he drove the evil spirits out of him. He left the town, discontented with the tiny fee \[he had received\]. After he had gone, the parents discovered that not only had their daughter not been cured, but that she was growing worse day by day. So, they wrote to the magician and sent no small a sum of money along with the letter, promising a larger sum if he would cure the woman completely. He deigned to come, gave the courier the material for another fumigation, and wrote down the ritual he should use, adding that when he got back to the house, he would find her somewhat better and dancing with female friends: and that is how it turned out. But since the wife was still not willing to sleep with her husband, he suffumigated her and added the words he had been told \[to use\], namely, \'Evil spirits, leave this woman, because Román tells you \[to do so\]. Otherwise, I shall send for him, and he will come and drive you out by force, because this is what he has promised me\'. At this invocation, the woman gave a loud cry, was cured, and remained free and lived with her husband the way married couples usually do. (This comes from the court records I mentioned).
[Page 122]

\(vi\) The power of magic and an evil spirit over the will is much more restricted. They are able to affect the will only by putting in front of it some external object, which may be one it hates as well as one it likes; or by stimulating sights and thoughts in the imagination; or by attracting and bending the will by inflaming strong emotions in a sensory part \[of the body\]. The stronger these \[emotions\] are, the more fiercely they bend \[the will\], sometimes as though they are removing it altogether. But they never impose irresistible compulsion on the will. Those people who argue for any necessity or compulsion when it comes to sinning, even in the case of people ensnared by mortal sins, are telling us to banish the will\'s freedom and of course, had they lost their free will, they would have ceased to be human beings. There are indeed people who have been robbed of the grace which makes someone pleasing \[to God\], but they have not been deprived of the natural freedom of their will, nor of God\'s help which is common to everyone. So whence comes necessity in the case of sin? One does not commit a sin without freely consenting to it. Free consent, however, presupposes free will, and this is why, unless God stops him, the Devil can push \[someone\] into some action of emotion and this movement by its very nature would be a sin if free consent were involved. But he can never make it compulsory upon the will to sin, because he cannot force a contented person \[to sin\] if that person is unwilling to do so. God does not allow an evil spirit to make use of his entire strength to tempt someone, either. He makes sure that the tempter does not tempt to the extent that he could, but only to the extent that human weakness can bear. He never allows this \[weakness\] to lack sufficient help, not even when it comes to the gravest of sinners, who still have in common with the righteous what St Paul wrote was a great consolation of the soul, not simply to the good, but to the whole Church of Corinth in which there were many wicked people as well as many righteous: \'God can be trusted and will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can \[bear\] but, along with the temptation will also\', (in accordance with the disposition and capability of anyone who has been tempted), \'create a means of escape so that you can bear it,\' Corinthians 10.13\].

This trustworthiness presupposes and includes preservation of the strength of the free will and of a divine help which is common \[to all\] and enough \[to help them\]-on this point I have taken these words from Theodoret-and because \[God\] faithfully delivers the preservation He has promised, the result is that not only does human frailty achieve a way out and an escape-this is how Augustine and Jerome interpret \'πoinoel TNV Èxβáoiv\' He will make the way out\]-from an evil spirit\'s temptation, \[such a way out being a happy outcome for a \[a person\'s\] virtuous will and effort, but also that once people have gone past the danger, they also become stronger when it comes to bearing \[temptation\] in future. As for losing \[the battle\], which is what would make people afraid, let us profit from temptation, as Photius put it very well. My translation also puts it very well, whatever the yelping from Moderns, because Exβaívelv means \'to go beyond. (See what Bede argued in relation to this verse from various passage in St Augustine). Since, therefore, sinners who rely on this support can avoid individual mortal sins, there can be no doubt that if they do succumb to temptation and have had the power not to give in to it, they will be succumbing voluntarily, not because they have been forced or compelled by a necessity which is not found at all in this case.
[Page 123]

But can the Devil at least hinder witches \[sagae\] from repenting? Ignorance of theology in regard to this question made Nicholas Rémy look like someone who was vacillating and undecided. It has to be said that just as \[the Devil\] could lead \[someone\] into sin, he is also able to encourage obstinacy in sin and feed \[that obstinacy\] with suggestions, seductive pieces of advice, and other temptations. But he can never entirely prevent other sinners, however grave they may be, or witches \[sagae\] themselves, from repenting and renouncing the pact they made with him. Therefore, by favour of the special help I mentioned, they will be able to repent whenever they earnestly want to do so, however much the Devil holds them back. Without that special help from God, they would not be able to do it. If it were otherwise, the Devil would have more power to hold them back than God does to rescue them, and that is obviously blasphemous. (Andreas de Vega proves this opinion, which Catholic theologians have in common, in his Justification, question 13.)

But in order to make clear by means of a particular example how far an evil spirit is sometimes accustomed to go in trying to constrain the will-not with complete success, but close to it, and not in actuality, but in appearance-for the consolation of those who have been tempted I shall record the words of Blessed Angela da Foligno. In chapter 19 of her Life, she describes one of her experiences.

\'I suffer more or less continually at the hands of evil spirits torments and sufferings of the soul and, I am telling you, there are more of them, and they are and incomparably more grievous than those suffered by the body. I don\'t know how to tell you what they are like, other than to say, think of somebody suspended by a rope upon a beam, with his hands tied behind his back and his eyes blindfolded, left on the gibbet still alive, without any help, any remedy, or any support. I am saying I am tortured in a greater state of hopelessness and more cruelly by evil spirits, because I see that the evil spirits are hanging my soul in such a way that, just as the hanged man has nothing to support him, so my soul does not appear to have any support left, and all my soul\'s courage is overthrown while my soul knows \[what is happening\] and looks on. When my soul sees that all its courage is being overthrown and is leaving, and that it cannot set oppose this, there is such great pain to my soul that sometimes I can scarcely weep because of my hopeless grief and anger. Sometimes, on the other hand, I can\'t stop weeping, and sometimes such great anger comes over me that I can scarcely hold myself back from ripping myself to pieces. Sometimes I can\'t stop myself from hitting myself dreadfully, and when I do that, I have sometimes made my head and other parts of my body swell up. When my soul sees all my courage vanishing and leaving, my soul starts to lament and I cry out to my God.

I also suffer another torment-that all my defects have come alive in me again and are now beginning to gather strength, \[and I suffer\], not because during my life-time they bring my reason under their control, but because they cause and bring me great punishment. Even vices which never existed in my body enter into me and are set on fire and bring me great punishment. But they do not last, and when they die again, they bring me great consolation because I see that I have been handed over to many evil spirits who cause the vices I abhor, and which were dead, to come alive again; and \[it is\] they who add the vices which never existed. When I remember that God was afflicted and despised here \[on earth\], I should like, (in as much as it is proper), all the evil things happening to be to be doubled. Whenever I am in the utterly dreadful darkness caused by the evil spirits, when it seems that all hope of good is entirely absent, the darkness is dreadful and the vices in my body, (which I realise inwardly are dead in my soul), are being revived. Outwith my soul, however, the evil spirits are reviving them and even those vices which did not exist are being revived. I also suffer physically in at least three places, because in my shameful places there is such a great fire that it was my habit to put physical fire to them to put out the fire of lust, until my confessor told me not to.
[Page 124]

When I am in that darkness, I believe I should more readily choose to be roasted than to suffer the things I have just been talking about. At that point, indeed, I cry aloud and call for death, \[begging\] God to allow it to come to me in any way at all. On those occasions I say to God, \'O Lord, if you must send me to Hell, please do it quickly and don\'t put it off and, since you have abandoned me, finish the job and plunge me into the deep\'. Then I realise it is the work of evil spirits and that those vices are not alive in my soul, because my soul never consents to them. My body, however, suffers violence, and there is such great pain and disgust that if it were to last, my body could not bear it. But my soul also sees that all power has been taken away from it, even though it does not consent to the vices. In spite of the fact that it does not have the power to resist the vices entirely, it also sees that it is opposed to God, and so falls and is tortured in them. There is also a particular sin which God has allowed to come into me, which never existed in me \[before\]. I recognise clearly this sin which God has allowed to come into me, and this sin is so great that it surpasses all my other sins. There is also a particular strength which God has clearly given me to counter that sin, and by this God sets me free by His special supernatural power. If I did not have a sure faith in God, the responsibility would lie with me and not with anyone else; and in that case a sure, untroubled hope in which I could have no doubt would be my responsibility. But the strength always prevails and the sin \[always\] fails, and the strength is in control of me and does not allow me to fall into sin.

The strength is so great that not only is it in control of me, it actually gives me so much of its strength that I really do recognise God in this \[situation\] and am illumined and strengthened to such a degree that I could not be moved to the smallest sin by anyone in the world, or any of the demons in Hell, or anything else; and my faith in God rests in me, along with this power. The sin, however, is so great that I am ashamed to mention it and \[to say\] that whenever the foresaid courage has been taken away from me, I also have the impression that what has abandoned me is not something which could protect me, either because of my feelings of shame or \[because it is\] a torment \[intended\] to stop me from rushing into sin straight away. But then the courage I mentioned comes over me and sets me free with its special supernatural power in such a way that I could not sin for all the good or evil in the world. These hardships I have borne for two years and more\'.

Thus far St Angela\'s translator, with insufficient Latin. In his words one can perceive three grades of \[St Angela\'s\] very oppressive and very troublesome temptation by the Devil, as well as the efficacy of God\'s grace which does not abandon the individual, and also that the will is never explicitly compelled by the Devil. However much its power to resist may be weakened and it may seem to succumb, it does not succumb because, with God\'s grace, a person has the power not to give his consent. Finally, you notice the \[spiritual\] progress which St Paul promised accompanies temptation. This section \[you have been reading\] is a kind of practical commentary on his words.
[Page 125]

Book 2, Question 25

What power does the Devil have over a soul which is going to be separated from the body, and over the separation itself? Ecstasy and extraordinary things connected with dead bodies.

The Devil can cause ecstasy or \'rapture\' in a human being by binding or loosing the external senses. He does this in two ways: (i) when he obstructs the pathways by which the sensory spirits \[spiritus\] go from the brain to the external senses, such as happens when people are dreaming; (ii) when he attracts the sensory spirits from the external senses to the organs of the internal sense and keeps them there so that they cannot descend to the organs of the exterior senses. This happens because the internal sensory pressure is too strong during a \'rapture\', and because the sensory spirits flow together to the organs of the internal sense and the external senses\' functions are so obstructed that the living body gives every appearance of being the immobile corpse of someone who is dead. This is the real, natural cause of a \'rapture\'. It does not exceed the Devil\'s power, and the ecstasies of witches \[sagarum\] and magicians belong to this kind of thing; and when they remain stupefied in one place, they are often deceived into thinking they have been in various places and have done various things.

This is the kind of thing Olaus Magnus tells us about Lapp magicians. If any traveller wants to find out exactly what is going on back home, they undertake that within twenty-four hours he will find out what is happening there, even if home is three hundred miles away. This is how they do it. A shaman \[incantator\] ceremonially summons his gods and then suddenly collapses and becomes unconscious as though his soul had suddenly left his body, because either he has no breath left in him, nor does any sensation, movement, or life seem to remain with him. But to make sure they are \[actually\] still there, there must always be someone with him to guard the body while it is abandoned and lying unconscious, because if this is not done evil spirits make off with it. Once twenty-four hours have elapsed, his breath comes back and the unconscious body wakes up with a groan, as from a deep sleep, as though the man who had fallen down were being called back to life from death. After he has been restored this way, he replies to questions and, to create trust in his questioner, tells him something his questioner recognises and knows for certain has taken place in his own home or in those of his relatives.

More people than Olaus testify to the truth of this, but one has to beware of the many errors in connection with this \[account of\] magical rapture, and similar examples of it which Olaus\'s ambiguous expressions favour not a little. Those who boast they have gone into a trance \[raptus\] by their own natural power and of their own free will, as \[Girolamo\] Cardano did whenever he wanted, are especially in error.³⁴² There can be no doubt at all that an evil spirit does this because it is part of his contract, and there is perhaps no surer indication of magic than this kind of voluntary trance. In the case of the virgin from Zaragoza-this is what I call her because her deception was finally uncovered in that city by the Archbishop in 1585-who pretended she had the stigmata of Christ, her \'raptures\'-and every one of them stemmed from a pact she had made with an evil spirit while she was feeding her sheep-were as frequent as those of Magdalena de la Cruz from Cordoba who was a notorious wise-woman \[saga\].

Bodin, too, is in error. It is a serious one and the censors should not let it pass and leave it in his book. Yes, I say he is in error when he thinks that the soul really does leave and forsake the body during this kind of ecstasy and, once separated from it, busies itself in other places while it is in that state.This was an error of the Kabbalists, and I suspect the Platonists were not averse from it, because of a well-known story told by Plato himself. Er, the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth, had lain dead for ten days among the corpses of those slain in battle. He was brought home and afterwards, on the second day, when he should have been put on his funeral pyre, he came back to life and gave an account of some of the extraordinary things he had seen while he was among the dead.
[Page 126]

There was a similar story about someone from Clazomenae in Book 3 of Origen\'s Against Celsus, and one about Aristeas of Proconnesus which Pliny tells in \[Inquiry into Nature\] Book 7, chapter 52, and in his Life of Romulus, Plutarch, relying on Herodotus, tells us that the dead man came back to life many times and could recover his soul wherever he wanted, and that those who were standing nearby could see his soul in the shape of a crow, flying out of his mouth. This man, however, was not dead, but in a magical trance, and it was not his soul which was flying out of his mouth, but a devilish conjuring-trick. The same has to be said about the white weasel which emerged from the sleeping soldier\'s mouth and went back in again, and then went back and forth across a small brook over a sword which someone had laid down. This story, told by Hélinand \[de Froidmont\], was a joke by an evil spirit who did it in order to impress on \[people\'s\] minds this error about the soul\'s migration, and to convince old women\'s fantasies and children still wet behind the ears, rather than natural philosophers.

Death is nothing other than a separation of the soul from the body, and since this separation happens at the same time as its leaving the body, the only result can be that when it does leave, the human being dies. If he does die, who brings his soul back into his body again? It can come back only through the power of God. The Psalmist tells us that the souls of the dead have no knowledge of where they are: that is, they are not aware of their body any more. Therefore once the soul has been separated, it cannot enter another body and cannot enter and inform its own \[body\] again, unless God allows it to do so and guides it. So, when people raise objections about the Lapps and Finns, and Aristeas, and Hermotimus of Clazomenae, I am not unaware of these \[objections\] and am not affected by them. A Devil-inspired ecstasy did happen, but their soul did not leave their body. \'One should pursue anything\', says Tertullian dealing with this subject, \'rather than this license of the soul to flee \[the body\] without death supervening\', and elsewhere he recorded quite rightly as axiomatic that \'the soul cannot exist anywhere without the flesh as long as it is in the flesh\'; and the author of the short questions attached to the works of St Athanasius overtly denies that the soul travels outwith the body during an ecstasy.

Nor is there anything in St Augustine which is favourable to Bodin. Indeed, in one place and another he overtly says the opposite. Opponents also misuse the Scriptures because when they cite the verse, \'the death of His saints is precious in the sight of the Lord\' \[Psalm 116.15\], they do not interpret the words about the ecstasy of the prophets correctly. These must be referring to a real death, or to the separation of the soul from the body, and however much you might want to understand them as referring to rapture, the word \'death\' means what it says, because it brings before one\'s eyes the picture of a dead body; and even though these words are thought to be about the Apostle\'s rapture, they cannot prove he was outwith his body. God could have done this, but whether He did so, I prefer to doubt, (since Paul himself was uncertain about it), rather than maintain, as St Hildegard does, that his body and soul really were separated at the time. I remember that all the Fathers \[of the Church\] as well as all the Scholastics have their doubts.

Bodin, however, shows that he has little acquaintance with \[natural\] philosophy when he mixes up aphaeresia with ecstasy. In the latter the soul appears to be absent from the body because the body has been stripped of the functions of the sensory soul which makes it move and sometimes makes it understand. In aphaeresia, however, the body lacks not only the functions of the soul, but the actual soul itself. In the latter case, one should say that the body is actually without any sensory perception and movement. In the former, (speaking with reference to its natural constitution), it is unconscious both potentially and actually. What kind of an argument is that? If the soul is immortal, it must be able to operate in some fashion without the body and, since it is immortal, it can therefore operate during an ecstasy when it has been separated from the body. My dear fellow, I advise you to go to schools run by logicians and learn that when something has more than one function, because you have not proved something about all of them, it does not logically follow that that restricts you to \[dealing with\] just one of them. Good God, how many functions does a soul have while it exists in the body over which the body claims no part and no right for itself? Consider the actions of the will and the understanding and their reflections on it, and the other things one can look for in the books of those who deal with the immortality of the soul. But as far as those who are acquainted with Christian philosophy and not unacquainted with natural philosophy are concerned, these points are too well established to need a more protracted proof, and I have neither the time nor the inclination to light a lamp merely for the sake of making them clear.
[Page 127]

Only God could separate the soul through rapture in this fashion and preserve suitable conditions in the body while it was happening, so that the soul could be taken back into it again, and St Paul acknowledges he is not sure whether this did happen to him. I think this is how one must understand what is said about St Giles \[of Assisi\] in The Deeds of Franciscans. When he was asked whether during this life the soul sometimes left its body during an ecstasy or during contemplation, he replied that it did and that he knew a man to whom it happened; and he said it \[happened\] either because once every bodily function was removed, \[the soul\] forgot it completely, or because divine power was removed from the body and was then brought back into it. (Juan Salvador Trados tells the story in volume 1 of The Deeds and Sayings of the Illustrious Order of St Francis, p. 205).

Thirdly, those who do not separate these false and demonic raptures from a real, supernatural rapture are in error, and I am fully aware that the two I am dealing with at the moment are distinguished from one another in a more subtle fashion elsewhere. In the latter, a human being is raised via a divine afflatus to contemplate or reflect upon supernatural things, and his mind is removed from things he apprehends through his senses. St Thomas \[Aquinas\], as usual, discussed very clearly how far removed were the ecstasies of the prophets, the Apostles, and the saints from those induced by magic, such as the ones St Irenaeus spoke about when he was dealing with the magician Marcus, \[Against Heresies 1.13\]. Marco Antonio Mocenigo, in a work more verbose than compact, has reviewed the opinions of a very large number of pagan philosophers and Arab astrologers on the character of a genuine rapture and, with the exception of the ninth \[one\], has refuted the rest of them quite satisfactorily. Listen for a moment to what I think is worth keeping from what he says, and what I think should be rejected. I think he is wrong when he argues that the subject of a rapture is some substance midway between mortal and immortal, and when he says that this is our soul which, he says, is mortal with respect to its sensory part and immortal with respect to its rational part.

He is mistaken. If there is one part of our soul which is immortal and another which is mortal, my question is, does this mean the latter be separated from the former? In that case our soul will be divisible and therefore not immortal. Far be that from our minds! We believe the whole of a person\'s soul, in so far as it is his substance and essence, is immortal. It is not the soul which is intermediate, but the person himself with respect to the entire way in which he is constructedmortal in body, immortal in soul. The subject of the rapture is not the human being taken as a whole. The subject-complete, non-physical, indivisible and immortal,-is the human soul; and the soul is the subject of the rapture, not because the intellect is active but because it is passive since, as Mocenigo has put it very well, the formal cause of the rapture is the actual action whereby someone is raised to and united, so to speak, with those heavenly things. The final cause is the conjunction of the mind with God: in the words of Anicius Severinus \[Boethius\],

\'You are a serene repose for the devout. To discern you is their goalBeginning, bearer, guide, path, the end they have in common\', \[Consolation of Philosophy 3.27-28\].

The active or efficient cause can sometimes exist in two ways. The active intellect will be the instrumental \[cause\], but God will be the principal \[cause\]. I said it can \'sometimes\' be this because, although God is, of Himself alone, the sufficient cause, He usually provides secondary \[causes\] as instruments. Therefore, it will be possible for the active intellect to be an instrumental cause because, although its ordinary office is to detach images from illusions, (and in this case there are no illusions), when God winds Himself into our mind by means of a rapture, He usually shows us the things He wants us to see by showing them to us in some divine way.
[Page 128]

But when our intellect has perceived these spiritual things then, with the aid of the intellect in its active role, a certain kind of likeness and representation of the things one has seen can be created. (St Thomas \[Aquinas\] does not refuse to accept this way \[in which it can operate\]). I said that God is the principal cause because it is actually God who draws a person to Himself, as Mocenigo says and has not been able to deny. You see, just as the sun is not seen in sunlight, just as the eye does not see light in the absence of light, and just as the ear does not hear that the air has been struck unless it is full of air, so God cannot be recognised in the absence of God. But when the mind is filled with God, in so far as, illumined by divine light, it recognises Him, it is lifted up to God; and in so far as, set on fire by divine heat, it is borne towards God, it starts to boil and leaps upward to higher things; and no one, according to the correct opinion of the Platonists, is raised up to that which is higher and infinite unless he is being drawn and lifted up by the power of something higher and infinite.

Secondly, the active intellect alone cannot be enough to do this because, although Mocenigo says that this transition is voluntary as far as the human being is concerned, in actual fact it is not. We know that rapture often happens to those who do not want it to happen, as St Thomas \[Aquinas\] thinks and experience tells us. I know, and a thousand people still living know as well, that there was a virgin dedicated to God who was still alive in Burgos in Castile, in 1585-one of those they call \'beatas\' there. The moment she caught sight of the Eucharist and, scarcely had she received it in her mouth, than she was lifted into a rapture. This happened every day and to such an extent that she could not feel small pins applied to and driven into her feet, and because she was someone who was averse from human glory, she was in the habit of begging God, very ardently, (since she preferred to be holy rather than talked about or seen), not to let anything of this kind happen to her in front of other people; and when she came back to herself, she would hurry home as fast as possible, full of embarrassment and shamefacedness, and lock the door.

So being estranged from our mind this way is not something which is under our control and therefore not something we can do voluntarily. Nor will it be something our intellect can do, however much and however ardently we may wish it. The \[rapture\] is not so much something the intellect does as something which is done to it, since in this case the soul is behaving, (strictly speaking), primarily in the manner of something which is passive, and secondarily, (and not so strictly speaking), in the manner of something which is active. Mocenigo himself acknowledges that this \'transition\', (which is what he calls a rapture), of a human being to God is very much more passive in character than active.

I say, however, that God is the efficient cause of a rapture not only because of a conjunction \[of humankind with God\] which is universal, but also because of one which is marked out for and peculiar to this very end. Here \[Mocenigo\] runs into sand-banks and allows himself to be swept off them by the gales of pagans and heathen philosophers because, in putting forward his opinion, he claims that one should ascribe the efficacious power of a rapture only to the active intellect. He means that only by means of the universal conjunction with God can this supportive \[power\] present an image or picture of God to the passive intellect, and that thus the active intellect, by its own power, causes what was merely potentially apprehensible now to be actually apprehensible, as if the active intellect can make any image which shows us God-something theologians, as well as St Dionysius the Areopagite, quite rightly deny.
[Page 129]

But see how flimsy are the arguments on which objectors rely. Their first objection is that God is not the same as our soul and therefore He cannot act upon it. What does \'talking nonsense\' mean if this is the way they argue? As if nothing can act upon something else which is not the same as itself, and the analogy and likeness of the direct, instrumental cause were not enough! As if not everything is obedient to God! As if God, who is one and to an eminent degree everything, cannot act upon everything as He wishes! Begone from me these heathenisms! Their second objection is that God is understanding. Therefore, He can do nothing unless He recognises it. But God recognises nothing outwith Himself. Therefore, He does not recognise our mind. Therefore, He cannot act upon our mind at all. My reply is that God is understanding if we interpret \'understanding\' as an improper expression for spiritual substance in general. But He is not understanding if you take \'understanding\' to mean intellectual potentiality, and in this way the result of the argument says that He is understood by Himself. But this would not be \[the result\], nor would the antecedent be consistent with the inference if one interpreted it in a different way, because it is certain that spiritual substances can be active in ways other than recognising, such as moving \[something\] from its place, and things of that kind. If \[Mocenigo\] simply meant to say that nothing can act upon a subject unless the subject recognises it, that is certainly true because God recognises everything. But a spiritual substance such as an angel could act upon any subject it had not recognised, and in consequence it follows that the minor premise that God recognises nothing outwith Himself is absolutely untrue. Does this mean that something other than God recognises nothing apart from itself, and that \[God\] does not recognise trees, or horses, or sinners, or evil spirits, and that \[while He is\] in this condition He preserves and busies Himself with the world\'s created things and punishes sinners? We have to acknowledge, unless we are followers of Epicurus and atheists, that things exist outwith God and are recognised by God.

God is indeed pre-eminently everything, but not in respect of form. If, \[Mocenigo\], you are speaking about things which exist to a high degree outwith God, you are deceived, because nothing which exists does not exist to a high degree in God. In this sense, too, our mind does not exist outwith God. Consequently, it is clear that you are talking about things which exist outwith God in respect of form. But God recognises everything, whatever it is, even if it does not exist in God in respect of form, or even if God is not everything in respect of form. Therefore, God recognises our mind. He recognises it very well and will punish it if He sees it is unfaithful and is going over to the irreligious dogmas of pagans.

I am not unaware of the maxim that God understands nothing outwith Himself, which is attributed to Aristotle, but Aristotle deserves forbearance because his eye, like that of a night-owl, was not illuminated by any ray of the true Faith and was blind to that infinite light. One should not, however, grant forbearance to Christians if they stubbornly defend such nonsense and proceed, not to submit the pagans\' maxims to the rules of the Faith, but the facts of the Faith to their maxims-blind guides, in fact, choosing the blind with whom to fall into the pit of error. Rather than one of Aristotle\'s maxims, this is one of Averroes\'s inventions, and he is the detestable summit of the falsehood which comes out of Arabia.

From this starting-point he has misled his adherents to the point where they think the following flows from it: that if God were to join a human being to Himself through rapture, He would be joining something newly perfect to Himself; or, if God were to understand that other things exist outwith Himself, He would need sense-perception and a passive imagination \[phantasiam\]-all of which even two-bit theologians can blow away at once as things dripping with worthlessness and having no coherence at all. God sees everything at one and the same time in Himself, as in a mirror. In recognising other things, He bestows perfection on them. Because of our weakness and need, perfection comes to us by union with or recognition of \[Him\]. God possesses everything. He is not changed but changes the things He joins to Himself.
[Page 130]

Finally, Mocenigo thinks that every rapture is a series of successive events, and this needs proper explanation so that it may be true. A rapture can happen in an instant, because God is the efficient cause of activity and infinite potentiality. But the active or passive experience of a rapture subsequently lasts over a period of time, and if a human being sometimes does things beforehand which lead to a rapture, such as contemplating, those things happen as a series of successive events. Nowadays this is not enough for a rapture. I do not deny that a person is prepared and disposed for raptures by a certain ardour during his contemplation and desire, as Rodrigo Dosma Delgado correctly tells us in Book 1, chapter 12 of his book on the authority of Holy Scripture. But I maintain that, for the most part, this happens to those who suffer the false revelations of evil spirits \[malorum spirituum\] if they make an effort and try to fall into ecstasies, as happened in the past to the Montanists and as happens today to magicians and Anabaptists; and not even under those circumstances is the rapture produced physically by an efficient cause from the will, but only figuratively and, shall we say, by agreement. So, none of this supports Mocenigo or contradicts me.

The other absolutely certain way in which the soul really is separated from the body is through death, and it cannot be denied that the Devil can effect this, with God\'s permission. After all, how many thousands of Assyrians did a single angel kill in a single night? \[Isaiah 37.36\]. Didn\'t Asmodeus kill Sarah\'s seven husbands, \[Tobit 3.8\], and didn\'t the Devil kill all Job\'s children? \[Job 1.18-19\]. Doesn\'t an evil spirit kill very large numbers of people every day with acts of harmful magic \[maleficiis\]? (I shall discuss this at greater length later, in Book 3). After death has separated the soul from the body, the Devil\'s power has not yet been put to sleep entirely. He can do several things to the soul: he can do several things to the body. He can inflict tortures on the separated soul in accordance with how much God has ordered him to punish it. Whether he can send it back into the body, or cause it to appear, I shall discuss in a moment. As for the bodies of the dead, he sometimes clothes himself and appears in them, as will be said later, and he also has power over them, especially over those which people seek out in unconsecrated places.

Whatever power he has over other physical things, he exercises power over \[bodies\] in a particular way, and is accustomed to perform and display certain wonderful things in them-marvels to those who are ignorant of natural causes-as though they were being done by living bodies and the soul which is animating them: for example:

\(i\) making blood flow from a dead person\'s wound in the presence of his murderer. I have talked about this elsewhere;

\(ii\) preserving bodies incorrupt for a long time, so that they do not rot, or decay, or dissolve, or turn to dust. This, after all, can happen naturally, either as the result of unguents, or the character of a location and, indeed, the constitution of the body, or even as the result of different kinds of death. Plutarch writes, \'It is well-known to everyone that bodies struck by lightning do not decay\'; and so Euripides, not very aptly, brought Clymene on to the stage, saying of Phaethon, \'His dead body is decaying here in a ravine\'. On the way a body is constituted, \[Lodovico\] Ricchieri quotes Ammianus Marcellinus to the effect that the bodies of the slaughtered Romans fell apart at once and dissolved completely, whereas those of the Persians became dry, the way logs do, and so their body-parts did not liquefy or turn soggy after they had been covered in blood.
[Page 131]

Ammianus thinks \[this was because\] their life was more frugal and their native land was dried up by the sun. \[Girolamo\] Cardano believes and claims the same thing for the body of his father, Fazio. I do not think this explanation should be brushed aside lightly because scarcity of food prevents the humours from being abundant, and Xenophon notes that, because they are abstemious in regard to food, Persians do not cough or blow their noses. When it comes to the location itself, it can either have this power of preservation naturally because of the soil or the sun, or even because of its situation. In his Olympics, Aristarchus said that the corpse of an armed man who had died of his wounds some time ago was found whole and unchanged between the floorboards and the shingles in the roof of Juno\'s temple in Elis. Pausanias explains this by saying that because it was hidden away in these concealed recesses, it could not have been damaged by the summer heat or the winter cold. In the case of unguents, this is a well known method of preservation \[practised\] by the Egyptians, as Herodotus and Diodorus tell us.

It is also a miracle of Nature that the hearts of those who have died from heart disease or poison cannot be burned. I do not think an evil spirit is unaware of these properties, which have been imprinted on the heart, or that he cannot introduce a similar arrangement into a corpse. Therefore, he could bring it about-and let this be point (iii)-that a corpse could not be burned no matter how long people tried. He has sometimes done this in the case of the living. Why can he not in the case of the Dead?

\(iv\) He will be able to bring it about that a corpse\'s hair or nails grow, because a dying person\'s physical constitution can do this naturally when some of the animating soul\'s organising power extends into the body towards a bit of it which is not complete. This frequently happen in those who have hanged themselves when their breath is suddenly cut off. \'Those whom Jupiter washes\', (as the saying goes), \'Apollo anoints and dries off\'.

Often, however, as in the case of relics of the saints, these things happen as the result of a miracle from God. So that I can pass over everything else, \[let me tell you this\]. In Damme, a town near Bruges, I once saw a very large wooden image of the crucified Saviour which had grown hair and a beard. These were shaved off every year but would grow back again. The devout considered this to be a miracle because of the frequent cures God used to confer upon the sick there, and other records of God\'s munificence were noted on a large number of tablets there until Calvinists, in their irreligious, obstinate folly, destroyed the image with fire and, as is their custom, razed the church to the ground.

I can also quite happily class the following \[anecdote\] as a portent from God. \'While Charles of Austria was holding courts of justice in Linz\', says Pietro Bizzarri, \'a child was born to a peasant. There was nothing healthy about him at all. He lived for fourteen days, sweated for three days before his death, and sweated until he died. Immediately the stigmata began to appear on the dead child\'s hands and feet and in his side, just the way we see Christ\'s wounds depicted in paintings. A crown like a crown of thorns also made its appearance on his head, on the skull itself. When the Emperor heard this, he sent some of his people. They looked very carefully at the portent, and then gave him a detailed account of the whole thing, which made him realise that the situation was exactly as people had said it was.\' (See Bizzarri\'s Epitome of Remarkable Things in Europe, p. 302). What bit of this can be ascribed to Nature? I really do not see any of it which is enough \[to explain it like that\].
[Page 132]

Book 2, Question 26.

Is it possible, with the help of evil spirits, for the souls or spirits \[spiritus\] of the dead to appear to the living?

This is a very important question and includes another which should receive an airing first. Can men\'s souls ever appear at all? I discussed this in detail almost nine years ago in Douai during the \'disputations\' as they call them, but because that lecture has not been published, I shall share with the reader here what I said on that occasion, but without the rhetorical flourishes.

Book 2, Question 26, Section 1

The first conclusion must be the foundation, as it were, of the rest: the souls of the dead, with God\'s grace and aid, can sometimes appear, and do often appear, to the living. This accords with the teachings of the Catholic faith and the principles of true, genuine natural philosophy. (i) Many people reject this conclusion, but some of them are atheists who deny \[the existence of an immortal soul and think it dies along with the body. It is easy to refute these people because their heresy was taken apart and invalidated a long time ago by Plato, Aristotle, and other able philosophers, and the Church sent those who defended it to the stake. (I pointed this out at great length in an extended argument in my commentary on the chorus in Seneca\'s Trojan Women).

\(ii\) Others are philosophers too devoted to the senses. The claim that the soul outlasts the body and can be seen by the living, but deny that it comes to the living, simply because they do not understand how or why this can happen. They need to be taught why and how.

\(iii\) There are the prattlers, (they do not deserve to be called theologians), who are born of the same mother as we are and suckled from the same breasts-false brethren, the offspring of vipers who attack their blood brothers and look to stab their mother with the point of an irreligious sword. (Obviously I am talking about heretics). Some of these conclude that those who maintain they have seen spirits \[spiritus\] are raving mad and have heads full of fancies and should be sent away to doctors \[to be prescribed\] hellebore. Others declare that all accounts of this kind are superstitious, and the worthless dreams of mad old women. Others, such as facetious pantomime artists and those who are less bloodthirsty, invent many disgusting and ridiculous tales, in imitation of the well-known Dutch Lucian \[Erasmus\], in order to render every kind of apparition hateful. The subject is a very troubling one to all these people because they realise that this apparition of the dead very much strengthens faith in Purgatory.

Consequently, I am astonished that Girolamo Maggi, a Catholic, (and a man of wider reading than good judgement), has been rash enough to write that phantoms \[simulacra\] which are seen in the neighbourhood of tombs or cemeteries are never the souls of the dead, but always deceivers of human beings-evil spirits or wicked sprites \[genios\]. I am also amazed that he supports this by citing Porphyry and Iamblichus, sworn enemies of the Christian faith, as his authority, because in a moment I shall demonstrate that he groundlessly \[criticises\] what Theophylact and Chrysostom have to say on the subject.

At the same time, too, I shall demonstrate that the doubts of the philosophers I mentioned are worthless. The witticism of the heretics, however, are worthy of them: that is to say, they are irreligious, shameless, lying, and scarcely worthy a reply. Excessively rash, too, was the very learned man, otherwise known as a \'patron of lawsuits\', while in full flow in the Parlement of Paris called this opinion a \'superstition\' and was of the opinion that those who think souls return should be punished. (Please read the last Book of his Religious Administration, and you will see his audacity accommodating itself to and demonstrating the less equitable case. But this was when many Moderns had inflicted themselves on the French courts. \[André\] Tiraqueau, however, was of the same opinion. \[His notes on\] Alessandro Alessandri\'s \[Festival Days\] Book 2, chapter 9 prove nothing, but baldly assert that he considered all these things to be mere dreams, and he repeats this in Book 5, chapter 23. But what he thinks is never going to make this \[subject\] more true or more untrue).
[Page 133]

To go on from these rather feeble individuals-my opinion is proved in the first place by common pagan opinion. Why did they have a tradition of evoking the dead, which they used to carry out with such solemn chanting and ritual, if they did not believe that any souls of the dead appear to the living? Why, (unless it was because what the common people believed was also the opinion of those in the know as well), would the Phoebus of poets say of Anchises\'s son, \'The unhappy figure and shade of Creusa herself Appeared in front of my eyes, an image larger than the one I knew, \[Aeneid 2.722-723\].

Why, too, would the Latin Callimachus introduce Cynthia recounting such things as this after her death?

\'The spirits of the dead do have a kind of existence. Death is not the end of everything, And the wan shade overcomes and escapes its pyre At night we are borne away and wander. Night sets free the shades which have been imprisoned, And Cerberus himself casts aside his padlock and goes wandering. Laws bid us return to Lethe\'s fens at dawn. We are borne along, and the ferryman surveys the freight he is carrying\', \[Propertius, Elegies, 4.7.1-2, 89-92\].

Why would they do this if, (in my opinion), the crime of divination by the dead had not started with them, \[a criminal activity\] which Homer\'s Circe in the Odyssey, Ovid\'s Medea in his Metamorphoses, Lucan\'s Erichtho in Pharsalia, Seneca\'s Tiresias in Oedipus, Horace\'s Canidia in his Epodes, Papinius \[Statius\'s\] Manto in the Thebaid, and Silius \[Italicus\'s\] Autonoe in The Punic War, practised with such pains? Why was \[the ancients\'\] custom of calling back to their native land the souls of those who had died in foreign countries known only to relatively few people, when Didymus, Eustathius, and Pindar\'s scholiasts mentioned it? From where in the world did the common opinion arise that souls are in the habit of appearing to those who slaughtered them and expelled them violently from their body? That they are present everywhere, and that they harass people and menace them? Why, too-and this is something the poet who wrote about festivals \[Ovid\] observed-did the founder of the city of Rome institute the Remuria, (otherwise known as the Lemuria)? Why were the Feralia, Silicernia, Culinae, and Parentationes solemnly observed under the Roman republic unless it was \[to honour the returning spirits \[spirituum Plato himself was favourably disposed \[to the idea\] in his Phaedo and his Letter to Dionysius, as were the Platonists Porphyry, Athenaeus, Maximus, Philostratus, and Eunapius.

A person from Madaura \[Apuleius\] taught and explained this opinion which comes from the Platonist school, that is, humans\' souls are called \'souls\' \[animas\] while they are still in the body, and \'personal spirits\' \[genios\] and \'daemons\' \[daemones\] when they are separated from the body. If they have been good, they deserve to be looked after by their descendants, to occupy the home in the role of a peaceful, tranquil divinity, and called \'household spirits\' \[lares familiares\]. But if they have lived a wicked life, because of the injurious things they have done to harm life, they have no resting-place with good \[spirits\], but are punished by having to wander the earth, or by some kind of exile, and are known as \'spectres\' \[larvas\], a terror to good humans and a source of hurt to bad.

Apuleius also says, in the first part of his Defence, Aemilianus, may the god Mercury who goes between the gods of the upper world and those of the lower grant you the ill favour of the gods of both, and always keep on casting in your way apparitions \[species\] of the dead, any shades \[umbrarum\] at any time, any spectres \[lemurum\], any spirits of the dead \[Manium\], and any goblin creatures \[larvarum\], and may he thrust upon your eyes all the terrors of the night, all the nightmares of the sepulchre, and all the horrors of the grave\'.
[Page 134]

Arnobius (Book 2) testifies that \[the ancients\] were accustomed to beg certain divinities that souls wandering near their bodies be not held back here on earth. \[Cassius\] Dio testifies to visions of souls in \[the sections on\] Caracalla and Titus \[in his Roman History\], and so does Plutarch in his \[Lives of\] Cimon, Dion, Brutus, and Alcibiades. St Augustine has followed the Platonists and adds that these wicked \[spirits\] are called lemures. Servius Honoratus writes that they were called Manes as long as they had not yet transmigrated into other bodies.

This same Servius and \[Pomponius\] Sabinus separate \'shade\' \[umbram\] and \'likeness\' \[simulacrum\] from \'soul\' \[anima\], because they think (incorrectly) that a human being consists of a shade, a body, and a soul, that the soul seeks Heaven, the body comes to an end on earth, and the shade or likeness goes down to the underworld. They mean that the shade is not a real body, but a kind of physical semblance which, like the wind, cannot be touched. But they do agree with the poets that, whatever \[the shade is, something goes up to Heaven or down to the underworld, and that sometimes it appears to the living, (as I have said elsewhere). They also thought that magicians evoke it by means of an evil incantation. So alone among pagans, \'hogs from Epicurus\'s herd\', (as one of them calls himself), \'with a well-cared for hide\', but a neglected mind, they denied that souls survive or appear.

All the others proved that \[they do\] by giving innumerable examples of every kind of wicked human being-Plato on \[the subject of Castor and Pollux, Valerius on Miltiades, Pausanias on someone from Lipara, Aristotle on Achilles, Philostratus on Romulus, the author of Famous Men on Caligula, Suetonius on the Athenian philosopher, Pliny the Younger on Pausanias\'s troublesome girl, Plutarch on Emperor Severus, Xiphilinus on the others, Apuleius \[Metamorphoses\] Book 8 and his Defence, Suetonius\'s life of Nero, Quintilian\'s twelfth declamation, Horace Epodes 5, Valerius Flaccus \[The Argonauts\] Book 1, and others too many to mention. My contention is that these can refer to the illusions and conjuring-tricks of evil spirits, but they do clearly demonstrate what I am going to add, which is based on Christian authors-that it must be said that, with God\'s permission, real souls have been able to exist not merely as an empty áyadua \[portrait\] or, as glossators call it, a \'lernum\' \[likeness\], (unless this should be read as \'larva\'.)

Book 2, Question 26, Section 2

My conclusion is proved in the second place in opposition to those philosophers who are too attached to the flesh-as St Augustine said very aptly, \'In a carnal human being, the whole rule of understanding lies in the habit of discernment\', \[Sermon 242.1\]. These people believe nothing if they do not see it and therefore, in fact, believe nothing. Against these, I say, my opinion is proved by a single reason-that since God is omnipotent, anything He can do does not involve contradiction. What I am saying, however, involves no such contradiction, since it is conformable with Nature. Therefore God, who created the souls, will be able to cause them to appear as things separate and distinct. Indeed, if God does not stand in the way, it would be possible for the soul \[to do\] this by its own innate power, because opponents have not been able so far to suggest anything which would let them prove this runs contrary to the natural condition of souls.

So why is this? Why does the natural condition of a soul not permit this? Is it because souls do not, properly speaking, exist in any \[particular\] place? I know this is what a number of people have thought. They have had the notion that no \[particular\] place is appropriate for a separate soul because of \[the soul\'s\] natural condition. But what they have said about the space which is taken up by the outer surface of the body which contains \[the soul\] and is appropriate for physical things is not relevant to this \[argument\]. Since we are talking about things which are spiritual and indivisible, the place which is to be taken up is entirely to make room for physical things along with non-physical things which cannot find a place elsewhere. Therefore, it cannot be denied as a matter of fact, that separated souls do exist in a place of this kind. Faith tells us this and tells us that the souls of the good enjoy God and are not on earth but in Heaven, and that, on the contrary, \[the souls\] of the damned are not in Heaven but under the earth and are tortured there in a special place. Reason tells us \[this\] and tells us that it is impossible for anything to exist and not exist in a particular space, namely: (a) in total, infinite space, (only God exists this way), or (b) in a part of space-that is, in this part, and not some other part-and this is how all created things exist. The soul, however, exists in this bounded spaced because its substance was transferred to that place rather than to a different one either by its own innate power, (because it transferred itself to that place, and even if it is not actually active there, it is enough that it can be), or it was brought down there by the external and more potent power of something else, (for example, if it was brought down unwillingly by some good or wicked angel, or was being kept there by force, as the wicked are in Hell).
[Page 135]

This is how the various theories of scholars can be explained: St Thomas \[Aquinas\], for example, who thinks \[the soul\] exists in a place because it comes into contact with virtue; \[Duns\] Scotus who thinks it is because of the presence of a substantial existence; and Julius Scaliger, most obscurely of all, who thinks it is because this is what has been planned. This is how a soul is going to exist in a place and how it will occupy a divisible space even though it itself is indivisible. Moreover, it will be able to occupy a larger or smaller place-this being the peculiar property of indivisible spiritual things, one which is denied to indivisible things which have measurable substance if in fact there are such things which exist separately from the body for a reason other than \[because they belong to\] the intellect, which is something I find difficult to believe inside the largest sphere of action it can occupy at one and the same time, according to how much more or how much less defective is the essentiality with which it has been endowed. This means it will be able to form a body for itself, which it can assume and in which it appears, which will be at least as large as the sphere in which it is active or, (which is more extraordinary), it could even form more and different smaller bodies, assume them all, and appear in all of them, provided they were all contained within its sphere of activity, just as it is generally accepted that angels can exist in more \[spheres\] than can accommodate their perfection. \[Souls\], therefore, can and do exist in a place which can accommodate them.

So, what is the problem? Is it that they cannot move themselves from one place to another? Theologians, however, tell us this is not true. It is proved that a separated soul can move itself from one place to another, since the human mind subsists by its own power and recognises things which are not in front of it and are far away. There is also a kind of natural communion and conjunction between it and heavenly minds, and as a result \[the human mind\] is conscious of this affinity and comes closer to those \[heavenly minds\] and enjoys a pleasant fellowship with them. But what is more defective than the \[human mind\] if it aspires in vain? It would aspire in vain if it could not attach itself to \[the heavenly minds\] by local motion and would be unable to ascend on high by its own power. Moreover, doesn\'t the soul bestow on the body it is animating the power to set itself in motion? Why can\'t the separated \[soul\] also move itself since it, too, exists in a space and very much stands in need of the power not to be most wretchedly tormented if it seeks something in vain? So why, (someone may object), can a soul not return to its body or visit its own home when it wants \[to do so\]? A pupil Plato did not particularly approve of \[Aristotle\] once made this objection. My answer to it is that once the soul has been stripped of the body which acted as its covering, it cannot clothe itself again at will. It is not permitted to wander about hither and thither at will, either, because it is either being held back in the penitentiary which is the receptacle for the most dreadful of tortures, or it is willingly obedient to the supreme governor of the whole universe, by whom it was brought down and planted in this dwelling-place. It does not go back to its body because the ingress of the soul depends on the body\'s being informed and given life by Nature\'s preparations of \[the body\'s\] material, and this very close union follows very soon after those \[preparations have been made\]. So, this does not contradict \[my conclusion\], either.
[Page 136]

Some people, therefore, say that these appearances are not possible because, since spirits \[spiritus\] have nothing to do with the body, they cannot be seen by the body\'s eyes, or heard by human ears, or perceived by any physical mode of recognition we have. What Lucretius said about \[the sense of\] touch "Nothing can touch or be touched except a physical object" - applies to the rest of the senses as well, (they say), because nothing is perceived by the external senses unless it has been endowed with a body. Nothing penetrates as far as the internal sense unless it comes via the external \[senses\]. Nothing is known or understood which has not been perceived by the external and the internal sense first.

Consequently, (they say), these \'visions\', which no one has seen with the external sense \[of sight\], and spiritual things which could not have been perceived by any of the senses, are not understood. I acknowledge that this is a tough nut to crack and that one needs to look for a strong chisel to break it open. The \[solution\] which \[Girolamo\] Cardano suggests, with very little finesse, in his book, The Intricacy of Nature-that a human distinguishes the spirits \[spiritus\] of the damned and actual evil spirits naturally by sight, hearing, and smell-is worthless and silly. A person would have to have better sight than Lynceus, better hearing than that \[provided by\] the asses\' ears of Midas and Silenus, and a keener nose than Plautus\'s boozy old woman if Nature had granted him the power to hear, smell, see, and distinguish spiritual substances. But perhaps \[Cardano\] was fashioning his souls out of rather thin, airy matter. Many people made this mistake in the past, although one hopes \[they do not do so\] today.

No more credible is what Caesarius \[of Heisterbach\], a more recent author than \[Aristotle\] and more recent than any one of the Fathers \[of the Church\], claimed more than once in his Dialogues: \'The shape of the soul is like a round glass vessel seen from every angle\', and elsewhere, \'The soul is a spiritual substance and because of its spherical shape, like the globe of the moon, it sees in every direction\'. This, I say, is incredible if he means what he says. I think these expressions are allegorical and metaphorical, and that by them he meant to point out the soul\'s essential perfection and ability to recognise many things, something which is clear from what he was saying.

But Cardano-someone who had doubts about the immortality of the soul, as nearly all his published works indicate, and especially one he wrote, but did not publish, on the mortality of the soul, (although he sometimes showed it to close friends)-adds error to error when he thinks that all apparitions are imaginary, and supposes that the main sights people have of them are perceived only by their imagination. I am willing to grant that this does happen sometimes, but I am ever more willing to deny that it happens every single time. The subject needs to be explained rather more clearly because it is well worth examination, and St Thomas \[Aquinas\] declares it is extraordinary and should be counted as one of God\'s miracles.

The ancients distinguished between \'vision\' and \'an impression made on the external senses.\' Their word for vision is брама, and no matter how many times we think we see it, it appears later the way it appeared at first. They call an impression made on the external senses фávtaoua. When someone is halfawake or asleep, but thinks he is awake, some shapes offer themselves to his eyes in order to be seen. I am putting off a discussion of \'vision\' to the following Books. At the moment I have to deal with the thing which is seen, which Christians prefer to call an \'apparition\'. An apparition, as St Isidore says, has three aspects: intellectual, imaginary, and embodied, \[Etymologies 7.8.37-40\] It is called intellectual when separate substances insinuate themselves only into the mind, and not in a different shape, but in their own. This rarely happens. One kind of image is that of the beatific, eternal vision and has nothing to do with this present treatise. The aspect called \'imaginary\' is also known as \'spiritual\'. \[This happens\] not, as Cardano thinks, when the body\'s physical spirits \[spiritus\] act as servants to the senses, but when separated souls attach a number of alien forms to our internal sense and these forms induce us to recognise them. Vision is called \'embodied\' when images of this kind are received by one of the external senses.
[Page 137]

At the moment, I am discussing the spiritual and physical \[aspects\], and I am arguing that neither of them is at variance with the laws of Nature. The spiritual \[kind\] is common to those who are awake and those who are asleep. In it, \'spirits\' \[spiritus\]-I prefer to use this word for separated souls rather than \'shades\' or \'spectres\', which is what the pagans called them-give form to certain illusory appearances \[ideas\] of themselves in a person\'s passive imagination \[phantasia\], rather than concealing themselves under a quite different guise and entering it by stealth. This way, they change and affect the internal sense and do so, not by means of the guise and not all by themselves, either, but with the ministering assistance of angels or evil spirits, because such images cannot be fashioned in a person\'s imagination without some kind of extraordinary power and the knowledge of how to do it.

Spirits \[spiritus\] lack this power because they cannot, of themselves, set other things in motion. They also lack the \[requisite\] knowledge and skill because they did not have it when they left their body and did not learn it afterwards. Go on, tell me! Who would instruct them, and where would his instruction come from? So, they paint art-work with a non-physical brush-images similar to the forms of living people-on the panel of the imagination. These have a rather gloomy general appearance and expression and, for the most part, dusky, dark-coloured clothing, in the case of those who are still undergoing punishment, and, in the case of those who have been set free from their torments, a shining white garment, a cheerful, beaming face and, (to distinguish them from the others), things which will make them look very much like living people.

\'Imaginary\' apparitions, therefore, are not impossible, and this is an easy way of appearing to the living. It is how Judas recognised Onias and Jeremiah, how, (according to several writers), Saul recognised Samuel, and Constantine recognised Peter and Paul. Let me offer the same proof in the case of \'physical\' \[apparitions\]. People object that they are seen only by those who are awake and that in these cases the spirits \[spiritus\] assume bodies and make use of them. In the following Question I shall show that they can do this, and \[I shall explain\] how they do it. For the moment I am assuming that whether you pay attention to theologians or Christian philosophers, it is now certain and clear that the bodies people see appear to be ones \[the spirits\] have assumed from substances separate \[from themselves\]. Therefore, why is it surprising if living people see \[the spirits\] in the bodies they have assumed, whether the carcass has been formed from the elements or is something else altogether? Both kinds can be seen.

But someone is going to press the point, \'Are you therefore claiming that the spirits of human beings also enter corpses, (something evil spirits certainly do)?\' As far as the souls of the damned are concerned, I see no reason why they should not do this, just as evil spirits do, because they do not enter them to inform them but simply so that they, \[the damned\], can move from where they are. I absolutely believe that the souls of the blessed do not enter bodies which are not their own and that it is not seemly for them to do so. There are those who claim they sometimes enter the bodies \[which used to\] belong to them. I grant that this is not at variance with the laws of Nature, and that it is proper for them to do so. Religious and learned men make this claim and I am not stubbornly resisting it.

But I am not foolhardily agreeing to it, either, because it does not seem decent or becoming for those holy souls, now glorified, to enter the confines of their dissolving, decaying bodies again before they are resurrected. They are not obliged to do so at all and can make use of an elemental body instead. There is the suggestion that this is the way the law-giver Moses appeared along with Christ, our Lord, on the summit of Mt Tabor. I do not think \[the idea\] that Moses appeared in a body made of air for that occasion, as \[Walafrid\] Strabo and St Thomas \[Aquinas\] thought, is objectionable. One will be able to say that this was a genuine apparition in which Moses\'s real soul appeared, and one will also be accurate in saying that Moses \'appeared\', because that is the preferable way of describing it. In his Care for the Dead \[18\], St Augustine, too, hints that he thought this apparition of Moses was not unlike that of Samuel, and no one says of Samuel that he appeared in his own body.
[Page 138]

All the arguments brought against St Thomas \[Aquinas\], too, are irrelevant with the result that one cannot take the authority of the Fathers \[of the Church\], who use the word \'resurrection\' in its broad sense, and apply it to Moses, saying that he is like someone \'rising up again\' in a body he has assumed, which is an opinion to which \[Cornelius\] Jansen inclined in chapter 67 of his Harmony. But because in fact St Jerome, Epiphanius, and most of the Fathers use the word of a real resurrection-you have their words in \[Francisco\] Suárez-I shall not drag out the argument further.

I say, rather, that real resurrections have nothing to do with the subject I am discussing here, because I am talking about the appearance of the dead and Moses\'s \[appearance\] was no more going to be that of a dead man than \[the appearance\] of Elias, since Moses would have been alive at the time, and so would Elias. But what did a certain \[author\] say in The Transgressor Bound?³⁷¹ When Moses answers the evil spirit\'s question, \'Where have you come from, Moses?\' he says, From the upper air, of course. Where I, fortunate man, was carried up with Enoch and Elias, And am awaiting God\'s final Day \[of Judgement\]\'.

This must be read with caution, because if it means that Moses was carried up while he was still alive with Enoch and Elias who were not yet dead, that is undoubtedly a rash thing to say and contrary to Holy Scripture. If \[it means he was carried up\] with Elias and Enoch and will come at the Final Time, that is equally rash. If \[it means\] Enoch and Elias were carried up into the highest fiery heaven, this is clearly novel and unheard of, because anyone who has a share in that glory before death is a saint, a pilgrim who has attained his goal. More dangerous by far in the same work are Michael\'s and the good angels\' bewailing the punishment of Lucifer and even accusing God of cruelty. Plainly that was about as valuable a thing to do as transforming Aeschylus\'s Prometheus into Lucifer and the Nereids into good angels! This was how daring the poet was prepared to be.

But to return to what I said about Moses: one needs to make the same answer about those who rose and appeared with the rising Lord. They, too, had returned to life and perhaps followed the Lord as He ascended into Heaven, and had no more part in death, if they merely appeared in their own body and informed it, as is very likely. Therefore, I deny that spirits \[spiritus\] assume their own bodies, (in order to appear in them, at any rate), and that they do so in order to inform them and give them life, because under those circumstances they are not returning in order to be what they are seen to be. They are doing so in order to furnish, by means of these \[bodies\] which are well-known \[to others\], a way in which they can be recognised, for which purpose a feigned body is perfectly adequate.

The souls themselves do not construct these elemental bodies for themselves. Angels or evil spirits fabricate them for them because separated souls cannot act upon them as necessary. This would have to be done by local motion, but a separated soul cannot move other things by itself with its own power, (as the more accurate opinion has it). This is because it lacks the physical organs which it needed to set the body in motion when it occupied a body. So, who is going to be able to press the point by asking, \'If \[the soul\] cannot act upon an elemental body, how, given that there is a close association between them, can it appear or enter it?\' My reply is that souls enter these bodies not because they have decided to do so, but because it is God\'s will and command \[that they do\].
[Page 139]

Under those circumstances, God bestows upon them some property which supplies the deficiency and I think this is fairly clear, as far as the souls of the blessed are concerned, because of their sight of God, which confers many gifts on them and satisfies their desires abundantly and in every respect. In some cases, however, the bodies are set in motion by spirits which are also evil spirits, and in others the body is set in motion by the informing soul. The movement of a human being depends on his instrumental organs, because humans are stimulated by their natural longing \[for something\], and the parts of the body

move because of some property imprinted upon the tendon-the tendons are also moved so that they can make the parts of the body move-although all parts of the body do not move at the same time, but one after the other. When the mind has been released from the body, it retains its longing, of course, but is deprived of its physical organs. So, the body to which it connected itself starts moving, not piecemeal or via its \[various\] parts, as it did while it was alive, but by thrusting its whole bulk forward. (It can happen, however, that because of certain conjuring-tricks, it can look as though it is moving by means of its instrumental organs). This, then, is how \[a spirit\] enters the body it has assumed and makes it move. So, the second proof of my conclusion-that it is in accord with the \[form of\] philosophy we call \'natural-remains secure. The following argument will prove the same in relation to moral \[philosophy\].

Book 2, Question 26, Section 3

The third proof of my conclusion is that it is fitting and beneficial that God permit this sometimes because if by these means it results in many people\'s advantage, and if it is something which promotes God\'s honour, it is seemly that God allow it, and objectors need to acknowledge that it is the kind of thing I am dealing with here. It would not be difficult for me to demonstrate that these impressions made on the external senses do us a great deal of good and grant us some access to the outward vastness of God\'s glory. These apparitions result in benefit to souls which have died in God\'s grace if they do indeed appear in their own body. (I say as I find). Yet if they appear in their mortal remains, they will have found this very pleasing and very agreeable, because souls have, from the cradle, an innate love of their bodies, (as if \[those bodies\] were their home), from which they were dragged by force and to which they return of their own accord. This is why Philostratus writes that \[souls\] are separated from them unwillingly, Plato calls them філођшиátous \[loving the body\], and St Paul said we are unwilling to be undressed, but would rather be overdressed, so that everyone can see that separation from the body is a grievous thing, as Theophylact explains.

Theologians agree that this love is not lessened by the separation and that a desire for their former union and for their re-integration remains. But even if they make themselves visible in someone else\'s body, they derive not a little pleasure from it because they make use \[of it\] to do the things we do and aim to do things which have the honour of God as their goal. Mean while, they also attend to their own situation-not only those which need support and help, because even at this time they are making atonement and are getting alms, intercessions, fasts, and Masses from the living, whereby they satisfy God\'s justice and obtain a diminution of their punishments: but also the blessed themselves, full citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, whom God occasionally orders to show themselves so that we may pay due honours to their bodies which were very pure temples of the Holy Spirit, as St Ambrose testifies of Saints Gervase and Protase. So they turn this to their advantage because they observe this in themselves and delight in paying honour to God.
[Page 140]

But, Almighty God, how many advantages, how many benefits accrue to us from this! They tell us that our soul outlives us and remains with our body. They show that the resurrection of the body, which they foreshadow, is not impossible. They proclaim that God has charge not only of the living but of the dead as well, and that these things are done at His command. They show that there are certain places where offenders are tortured incessantly and the devout enjoy immortality and take pleasure in their yoke. We are reminded of the fellowship and communion which exists between us and the spirits of the dead. They bring us God\'s commands and become the occasion of mutual love and other virtues. They inform us about their condition and tell us how we should be leading our lives. Sometimes they present themselves to the dying as companions on their journey and guides to Heaven, their homeland. Because of their warning, we turn aside God\'s anger. We get good sense from them.

They drive away misfortunes which are threatening to weigh us down, and they require that the wicked be punished as an example to the good. We are also helped by the spirits of the damned, and through them our faith is strengthened. The fact is, we give our assent much more readily to those we think we should believe \[when they tell us\] about the punishments \[meted out\] to sins, and the justice and providence of God. (A theologian of my Society, Petrus Thyraeus, has considered all these points, explained them briefly and with great skill in his treatises, and proved them to the hilt with examples and narrative accounts. His writings are very popular and give equal pleasure and profit, and while I am engaged in this discussion, I don\'t want to repeat the points he makes).

Consider, noble Reader! Aren\'t the fruits we pluck from apparitions excellent and splendid? Aren\'t these gems more precious than any gold and pearl?

Those who strive to tear the Faith from mortals\' minds are endeavouring to rip all this away from us-through wickedness and envy if they know what they are doing, through stupidity and thoughtlessness if they do not. When it comes to this subject, they thrust fear upon us, and yet they are afraid in a situation in which there is nothing to be afraid of. An enormous field of fraud, (they say), is sown because of this belief. Its furrows of afflictions are harrowed, and the broad meadows of superstition tilled. Fine nets are set out all over the place, and crafty nets are set up in which the unwary are caught and entangled. Satan has a habit of transforming himself into a human being and, indeed, into an angel of light, so how shall we distinguish him from real spirits? Discernment of spirits is a gift from God, and one not granted to everybody. Therefore, the human race has decided that if such apparitions do happen, God has not left it remedies capable of discerning them.

My reply is that the method of accurately discerning spirits of this kind is difficult and not accessible or clear to just anyone. But there is no lack of things written by learned people, which throw light on this darkness so that we may not fall perilously into error. They publish individual signs \[whereby one can discern spirits\] which are true enough in themselves-some more so, some less-and if most (or rather all) of them were to agree with each other, they would be pretty reliable and enlightening. Bertram, Bishop of Tiflis, wrote an entire treatise \[addressed\] to Euno, Archbishop of Trier, in about 1387. Johannes \[Bremer\] von Hagen, otherwise known as \[Johannes\] de Indagine, investigated the subject in a book about the apparitions of a particular dead woman, and the theologian Jacobus de Clusa dealt with it quite fully in an entire work on the appearances of spirits, how they should be investigated, and how one finds out whether their appearance is real or feigned. \[Johannes\] Weyer tries to scoff at him, as he does everything which is Catholic and respectful to God, but he reveals nothing thereby which is not respectful to God, which is not sensible, and which is not religious. He is a writer few people know. Better known are the exertions of \[Theodor van\] Pelt and the treatises of \[Petrus\] Thyraeus I mentioned earlier. From these, one can select \[observations\] which are more reliable.
[Page 141]

\(i\) If they are put to flight or revealed at the sign of the cross, the names \'Jesus\' or \'Mary\', or those of other saints, or by their relics, a wax Agnus Dei, holy water, blessed bread, salt, or wax, or other sacramentals of this kind, or symbols of the Catholic religion: if these have driven the apparition away, but \[the spirits\] still come back for no good reason and cause more distress-because when you satisfy souls they either do not come back, or do so only once in order to thank you, whereas by contrast, evil spirits string together reason after reason, either so that they can carry on haunting or, at the very least, so that they can practise serious deception-when these things happen at the same time, \[the apparition\] is the Devil.

\(ii\) If it says it is the soul of some damned person, it is lying and is, generally speaking, an evil spirit, because the souls of the damned are scarcely every allowed to come out \[of Hell\].

\(iii\) If it offers a spurious or wicked reason for its appearing-for example, it says it has been forced to appear because of the power of a magical incantation in order to reveal things about which one is inquisitive, but which one does not really need to know, or things which would be better left unknown-it is an evil spirit.

\(iv\) If its language is deceptive in other ways, superstitious, offering bad advice, manifesting and revealing the disposition of someone who is desperate, arrogant, libidinous, vengeful, or otherwise thoroughly disturbed, it is an evil spirit.

\(v\) If it appears in a shape which is not human, beautiful, and well-formed, but hideous, misshapen, or base, or \[in the form\] of a dog, a snake, a pig, a serpent, a spider, a toad, or similar creatures, or a black African, it is an evil sprite \[malus genius\]. If, on the other hand, \[it appears\] in human form, it may then be considered to be good, the work of an angel, a saint, or God. If its character is morally wicked-blasphemous, superstitious, lying, murderous, lustful, etc.-or if its behaviour is deceitful, (if, for example, during the first conversation \[one has with it\], one feels happy and calm, but later on \[one experiences\] dread, confusion, or desolation): or it goes away accompanied by a great stench, loud noise, or things being dashed to pieces, it is an evil spirit.

St Antony bequeathed this warning to his followers in something like the following words. Discernment of good or bad spirits is not difficult. If joy follows fear, we may be sure the aid has come from God. If, however, we are struck by dread, and the dread stays with us, it is the Enemy we are seeing\'. With this rule, which St Thomas \[Aquinas\], St Catharine of Siena, \[Jean\] Gerson, and others of proven experience on this wrestling-ground found, not without good reason, to be a good one, Father Ignatius \[Loyola\] armed his followers. He himself had had experience of this in a false vision furnished with eyes. While it was present it would bring him joy, but when it was absent he would feel sad.

By contrast, it is the special property of good spirits either that they preserve the feeling of happiness they bring to the mind, or remove fear from the start and make up for it with an immense feeling of peace, such as we know happened in Mamre, to Gideon, to the Blessed Virgin, and others.³⁷⁸ St Macarius was of the same opinion. Things which proceed from God and good angels, (that is to say, by grace), have been endowed with joy, love, peace, and truth. Those which come from wickedness, (that is, the Devil), are filled with perturbation and have no love or feeling of joy for God, (that is, anything which is heavenly). (I shall have more to say about this in the next Book, which deals with revelations.)
[Page 142]

I think these are not unintelligible indications of how to discern visions of bad spirits from good, and under those circumstances we ought to have no hesitation about which we should reject, because these are always either of evil spirits or the damned-if the spirits of the damned ever do actually appear. You see, even if I acknowledge that God can allow this \[to happen\], I have difficulty in seeing why He does so.

Certainly, if He did permit it, I do not see how the manifestations of those \[souls\] can be discerned from evil spirits unless, perhaps, they were to make known or reveal things which would surpass any human knowledge, or unless they were to take over a living human body, because souls or good angels never steal into the bodies of living human beings. That is the kind of thing evil spirits do, as Zoroaster noted in his Magical \[Prophecies\]. (See Pierre Le Loyer, Spectres Book 4, penultimate chapter).

So, what, (someone may say), do you say about those people whose souls, we read, have been told to go into their body again and, indeed, some \[souls\] which have been sentenced to the tortures of Hell and have been released therefrom? (An example is Andreas of Rome in 1070, whose story is well worth reading and can be found in Book 1, chapter 33 of the life of St Hanno of Köln in \[Laurent\] Sauer, Volume 6, for 4th December.) My opinion, of course, is that God has sentenced them to Hell only for the time being, because there is no relief from Hell when someone has been sentenced to it without remission. But it can sometimes happen that shortly before they seem to die, they have not actually breathed their last, but have simply experienced an ecstasy during which, because of what they see and what is shown to their mind\'s eye by God, they think they have died and have really been hurried off to judgement and to everything else they tell us about. Then, after they have told their story, they really do breathe their last, either at once or after a long time.

This is Cardinal Baronio\'s theory, as well as that of others, and \[can be found\] in Volume 11 of his Annals \[of the Church\], under the said year 1070. But although Andreas says there that he really had died, he is not actually saying he had been sentenced to perpetual tortures in Hell, simply that he had been dragged to the places of eternal damnation, (which can also be said about someone damned for the time being). This is the opinion of St Thomas \[Aquinas\], Durandus, Richardus, and Alonso Tostado. (Read \[Cardinal\] Bellarmino On Purgatory, where he discusses the soul of Trajan; \[Gregorio de Valencia, Part 3, disputation 11, question 1, point 2; and Francisco Suárez, Part 3, volume 2, disputation 43, section 3.)

It is equally difficult to distinguish the apparition of angels from that of saintly human beings, because I think that apparitions of those who are in Purgatory are, for the most part, revealed to us as substitutes for those of good angels. I know that learned men have mentioned certain signs-that human souls which are already blessed appear with a rather happy expression, \[whereas\] those still expiating their sins appear with one which is gloomy and rather sad. (This is certainly quite likely). They add that appearances of angels are distinguished from those of humans as follows: the souls are human if they look like bearded old men, children, or females, or if they are clad in mourning, because none of this is fitting for angels, just as they do not show themselves in the guise of any base creature, not even that of a dove.

Likewise, if they preach or teach things which exceed human understanding, or if they demand prayers or any other assistance. One is disposed to ask these \[learned men\], can guardian angels take the form of those whose guardians they are and who are expiating their sins in Purgatory? Certainly, it is a possibility and is what usually happens, and \[learned men\] do not deny this. So why, under those circumstances, would \[the apparitions\] ask for prayers or some similar help? Why on these occasions do they not appear in the form they had while they were alive-a child, a bearded old man, a gloomy man, or a female-so that they can be recognised? Secondly, don\'t the blessed now know many things which surpass \[earthly\] travellers\' understanding? Don\'t they also know what is going to happen, as angels do, if God has revealed it to them?
[Page 143]

These signs, therefore, are unreliable and a number of anecdotes contradict them. We find it written in the lives of the \[Church\] Fathers that an angel with the appearance and face of an old man appeared to a hermit who wanted to understand the inscrutable depth of God\'s judgements. There is a very wellknown story about St Augustine. While he was giving thought to his commentaries on the Trinity, a child appeared to him. The child was making a vain, useless attempt to pour the sea, regardless of how big it is, into a small ditch with a spoon. He could not be mistaken for an angel, any more than the other \[apparition\] in the very old story about St Dorothea\'s struggle. This one was like a very pretty, delicate four-year old child and had brought delightfully blushing roses and fresh apples to Theophilus in the middle of winter, just as the virgin, boldly trusting in God, had promised, even though everything in the area was bristling with frost and shrivelled up because it was so cold. Rufinus \[of Aquileia\] and St Bonaventure testify that Wisdom and Chastity presented themselves to St Gregory of Naziazenus\'s sight and, unless this had happened to him while he was asleep, one might suspect they were angels in female form.

St Lorenzo Giustiniani claims that a virgin, brighter than the sun, appeared to him to tell him she was God\'s Wisdom who had taken human form for the sake of reforming humankind, and that God had given her to him \[St Lorenzo as his bride. She then gave him the kiss of peace and withdrew. His biographers say this was our Lord Jesus appearing to him in that form. I should think it was an angel rather than \[Jesus\], because if Christ Himself appeared in female form, why do we not believe that angels sometimes make themselves seen in that same guise?

There is a life of St Gommar who is venerated by my fellow Brabantines, recorded either by Theobald or some other ancient eloquent writer, in which you can find that an angel, sent by God, presented itself to be seen in the guise of a dove glowing with a remarkable brilliance on top of his sleeve. It advised him against a pilgrimage he intended to make, and suggested he change to loftier studies and labours. The holy man obeyed, and in nothing which took place afterwards can one detect the mocking deception of an evil spirit. On the contrary, several things \[happened\] from which it appears that this took place on God\'s instructions.

(I am not unmindful that evil spirits have, in the past, misused the image of a dove which has been set apart as \[a symbol of\] the Holy Spirit). So I am persuaded that this apparition was that of a good angel. Another vision, conferred upon Wambert while he was awake, seems to tell us that an angel appeared to him in the form of an enormous eagle-see \[Laurent\] Sauer, the Life of St Bertulf, chapter 12, under 5th January-although if anyone were to argue that this was a real bird, (as it seems was the one Bishop Noger writes about in The Translation of St Laudoaldus, in Sauer, volume 2), I should not particularly object.³⁸¹

I recount these and similar \[anecdotes\] so that \[you may not think\] I am agreeing unreservedly with the signs recorded by the \[writers\] I have mentioned. But \[I do so\] principally because I think that the whole discernment of spirits-and \[the writers I have mentioned\] do not deny it-depends first and foremost upon divine revelation. Moreover, my judgement, (like that of St Augustine), is that it is safer and more preferable that I acknowledge my ignorance in this matter and take the role of pupil rather than, with ill-considered rashness, give an explanation of something and behave as though I were the teacher. The subject, after all, is too important for me to be able to undertake it, too abstruse for me to be able to explain it, and too deep for me to be able to wade through it. This is what I have to say about the third proof.
[Page 144]

Book 2, Question 26, Section 4

One looks for the fourth proof in divine and human authority. I call \'human\' the authority which one does not look for in the sanctuaries of theology but in the shrines of human wisdom. Let me separate these proofs. Let the fourth one be the one I drew at length from pagan opinion at the beginning of the Question. Add to this what Plato thought in relation to this in his Phaedo, \[Hermes\] Trismegistus in his Letter to Tatius, Apuleius in Defence 1, Maximus of Tyre in his book on Socrates\'s deity, Plutarch in his \[Life of\] Brutus, Pliny the Younger in his letters, and Lucian in The Lover of Lies. (I shall omit Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides, Vergil, Seneca, and the rest of the poets, and also the historians \[Cassius\] Dio, Pausanias, Tacitus, and Suetonius). One looks for the fifth proof in the writings of certain astrologers who think that the appearances of souls depend upon a particular conjunction of and influx from the stars-Ptolemy, for example, Julius Firmicus, Albumazar, and other Arabs whom Pomponazzi followed; and even if others refuted their heresy with learning and absolutely accurate arguments, it is still perfectly clear that these people, (practically atheists), recognised the appearances of souls, with the result that the heretics of our time are quite rightly adjudged to be worse than they were.

The sixth proof can be taken from the opinions of Chaldaeans, Mahometans, Kabbalists, and Rabbis, all of whom are in unanimous agreement that we should accept that souls do appear. (I am talking about a \'synagogue\', \[i.e. the witches\' sabbat\] now condemned after Christ\'s crucifixion). It is agreed that Josephus was of this opinion, as much because he thought the soul of Samuel really did appear as because he says that \[Marcus Valerius\] Catullus had been dreadfully troubled by the spirits of the men he had slaughtered. Simeon Ben Joaz thought the same in his book Machar Hasudoth; Rabbi Haccados records many apparitions in his book Galerazaya \[\'Revealer of Secrets\'\], as do others cited by \[Pierre\] Le Loyer. \[Le Loyer\] also proves the same point in the case of Kabbalists, who do not call the \'spectre\' or \'shade\' of pagans \'neshema\' \[spirit\] or \'ruach\' \[breath\], but \'nephesh\' \[soul\]. (See Servius: Vergil called it an \'image\'). They mean \[what\] is seen after death in the neighbourhood of tombs.

Muslims believe the same because of their pseudo-prophet, as Avenzoar \[Ibn Zuhr\] and Avicenna \[say\]. This was the opinion of Zoroaster in his Magical \[Prophecies\], as it was of the Indian Brahmin of Calcutta, Coloimum, and Malabar, and all the other peoples of the east; and Floridians, Peruvians, and all other westerners believe the same thing. I thought it a good idea to draw attention to these people, not because I think their opinion worth anything, but because they contradict Epicureans who reject Holy Scripture, and heretics who spurn an opinion the Church has always had: in a word, because I am compelled to go into battle with goblins \[larvas\] and buffoons, as well as witches \[larvas\] and twaddle.

Legal archives and those of courts of justice provide the seventh proof. Ulpian recognises a kind of prodigy \[ostentum\], a фабиатератидес \[prodigious apparition?\] Martianus \[Capella\] the spirits of the dead \[Manes\], and \[Herennius\] Modestinus condemns the magical sacrifices whereby it was thought that spirits \[spiritus\] were invoked. What he calls \'summoning the spirits of the dead\' was something many people tried to do, and the Emperor Constantine made it a capital offence. (In relation to this, there is a different reading \[of the phrase in this passage, which has \'when evil spirits have been summoned, instead of \'when the spirits of the dead have been summoned, because for the most part, the spirits of the dead were actually evil spirits falsely claiming to be souls). Legal experts not of the humblest reputation have held this opinion about the appearance of souls: \[Guillaume\] Budé and \[Andrea\] Alciato on the word \'prodigy\' \[ostentum\]; Cristoforo Porzio in the last paragraph of his Institutes, \'de localibus\'; Arnoul Le Ferron in his Customary Law of Burgundy; Alessandro Alessandri, Festival Days Book 2, chapter 9, Book 4, chapter 19, Book 5, chapter 23, and Book 6, chapter 21; Diego de Covarrubias y Leyva, Various Resolutions Book 4, chapter 6; Pierre Le Loyer, Spectres, the whole of Book 3. In chapter 4 he tells us that Barnabé Brisson, President of the Paris Parlement, also held that opinion. Since the general sentiment of \[Church\] Councils, holy Fathers \[of the Church\], and theologians supports these authors, I have no hesitation in placing them before you, even though all the other legal experts think the opposite.
[Page 145]

Eighthly, my conclusion is proved because this has always been how the Church has understood it. It is proved in the time of the Old Testament because Samuel\'s soul appeared to Saul, not because it has been roused by the power of a magical incantation, but because it has been sent by God. This appears to be the more accurate opinion. It has had the support, not only of rabbis of long ago-Ahia, Sandia, and Eleazar-and these are certainly to be preferred to the innovator David Kimhi-but also of Josephus and very important Fathers \[of the Church\], Justinus in his Against Typhon and St Augustine in Care for the Dead. I proved earlier that this opinion is consonant with Holy Scripture, and if we are to accept Ecclesiasticus as canonical, as all Catholics do-I am astonished that St Thomas \[Aquinas\] was inclined to doubt it, Part 1, question 85, article 8, reply to objection 2-we cannot gainsay it, as weighty theologians of the present time have observed.

The objections Le Loyer puts to us in Spectres Book 4, chapter 1, as wordy as they are energetic, are of no great importance. (a) He does not distinguish between the following proposition, \'Samuel really did appear in a body he had assumed by the power of a magical incantation or by virtue of an evil spirit\', and this one, \'Samuel really did appear in a body he had assumed by order and command of God, as a result of which Saul and the prophetess were deceived because they thought it was the result of a magical evocation\'. Tertullian, Cyril, Anastasius, and the other Fathers he adduces actually denied the first proposition, and they were quite right to do so.

None of them discussed and denied the second one which I am now defending, and so all Le Loyer\'s devices which run counter my opinion fall to the ground. (b) God, he says, has forbidden anyone to ask the dead to tell him about any subject or to consult magicians or similar misleading individuals. But since Saul tried to do this, contrary to God\'s instruction, one should not believe that Samuel, a very great enthusiast for divine law, had been willing to co-operate, so to speak, or at least to be favourably inclined to the disobedient kind and given him satisfaction. My answer is that God sent Samuel to reprove the disobedient king, threaten him with immediate punishment, and so encourage him to repent. Likewise we read that because they had garlanded the doorways \[of houses\], similar apparitions happened not infrequently to Christians in the time of Tertullian for the sake of getting these sinners to ask to be set free \[from their slavery to the Devil\].

Eusebius tells us that Natalius was scourged by angels in the same way because he had attached himself to a group of heretics, and St Augustine tells a similar story, as though it were well known to him, about a citizen of Hippo \[who received warnings\] because he was accused of breaking an oath by swearing falsely. Bede testifies that when Lawrence, Bishop of Canterbury, was thinking about running away from his flock, he was scourged by St Peter; and during the reign of the Emperor Maurice, the Blessed Virgin appeared to a landlord while he was asleep and ploughed round his knees with a switch because he had not thrown blasphemers out of his guest-house, and in the morning it was found that his shin-bones had been sundered from his legs. (See Nicephorus, History).

\(c\) \[Le Loyer\] objects that this was an evil spirit because it gave Saul no good advice at all and did not encourage him to be penitent but threw him into despair. My answer is that it is the duty of preachers and confessors to put the brevity of life before people, and to repeat the prophet\'s verse, \'Set your house in order because you are going to die and you are not going to live\', \[Isaiah38.1\] and, \'Fool, tonight they will take your soul away from you\', \[Luke 12.20\], and other things of this kind by which they can induce a holy fear. But if sinners thereby seize the opportunity to lose hope, it is wrong to blame the preacher and impute the guilt to him because \[the sinner\] has misused good medicine. One can see similarities in the case of Samuel. The things he was proposing as proper for penitence, Saul turned into bad medicine. Secondly, everyone is perfectly well aware that sometimes pieces of advice and encouragement help when they are not given directly but expressed, as it were, indirectly, because this way they have the power to console and call \[someone\] back from wrongdoing.
[Page 146]

My opponent should have considered this and not employed the argument he did. (d) With regard to the passage from Ecclesiasticus, chapter 46, verse 23, he replies that he meant merely that the writer was there recording Samuel\'s individual praises and was not particularly bothered whether the vision was false or real. The words, however, do not support this. Here is my translation: \'And after this he fell asleep and showed and made known to the King the end of his life. He lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy to destroy the ungodliness of the nation\'. Samuel \'made it known to the King\' after his own death, or after \'he fell asleep\'. This is the Greek: xαì µετà Tò úπvwoal αútòv проеTherefore, the one who was dead prophesied and, coming out of the ground, made his proclamation-Ex MS TNV that Saul, the ávouíav \[lawlessness\] of the people would die.

\(e\) He objects that the Fathers \[of the Church\] say that the author of a book in Greek, Questions for Orthodox \[Christians\], (which he talks about with little expertise), is actually Justin Martyr, who holds the opposite opinion. Indeed, this legal expert rashly pronounces that whatever is recorded in that book agrees entirely and in every detail with Holy Scripture. (If this were the time, and the place permitted, there would be no shortage of objections to be made to this). But he also objects that St Augustine has not been properly understood because in chapter 15 of his book Care for the Dead St Augustine very plainly, (and this has been said with my opponent\'s good leave), agrees with me, as I have said elsewhere and now Jesuit theologians have clearly demonstrated.

Other Fathers take no issue at all with me, because they merely wanted to deny that Samuel could have been woken by the power of a magical incantation, and because they themselves used to attribute this apparition to the magic of the prophetess-an idea which was neither necessary nor true-they slipped away from that kind of idea and the result was that they denied that anything other than an evil spirit had appeared; and because I think that notion is untrue, when it comes to this subject I have abandoned those Fathers in favour of others. (f) After saying, at length, a good many things which are irrelevant and πapépyws \[beside the point\], he thinks that the verse, \'Tomorrow you will be with me\' Kings/Samuel 2 was a lie if it was said by the prophet \[Samuel\]. I have already suggested, at the end of Question 6 in this Book, that this verse was clearly true. So, the authority of Holy Scripture on the soul of Samuel is clear enough. A still clearer \[example\], as St Augustine says, is that of Moses who appeared with Christ our Lord on Mt Tabor, even though he really was deadSt Augustine thinks it quite likely \[he appeared\] in an assumed body made out of air-and a third example is that of Jeremiah and Onias who appeared to Judas Maccabaeus, \[2 Maccabees 15.12-14\].

But let me come to Christian times-to omit the Jews, whose opinion on this subject has been uniform, with the exception of the Sadducees-because heretics indiscriminately deny apparitions of the dead in general, whether \[the spirits\] are blessed or not. Therefore I am going to deal with these in general, whether \[the spirits\] are already in Heaven or have not yet \[gone there\], and I shall run through every epoch of the Church so that it may be absolutely clear that Catholics have really always had this perception; and \[I shall give\] examples of some people who confirmed it after investigation and others who proved it clearly and satisfactorily by providing examples of apparitions they considered to be perfectly true.

Right from the start this was the opinion of the early Church, of the Apostles, and of Christ our Lord Himself, because when He was aware that the Apostles believed it, He did not rebuke them and say the opposite, (because the best teacher and true light of the world was not going to let this pass by), but rather fixed this opinion more firmly in their minds by His silence, sanctioning it by means of this indirect reply, as we shall see in a moment. For example, after His resurrection, Christ our Lord came to the Apostles even though the doors were closed, something they did not think possible unless it was done by a spirit \[spiritu\]. They thought they were seeing a spirit and were therefore extremely disturbed and terrified. Indeed, Theophilus expressly declares that they thought it was some soul which had come back from another life. St Augustine, Eucherius, Bede, Cardinal Hugo, and many others had the same idea, but they thought it was Christ\'s soul in an assumed body \[made of air, not His own body, and that \[the Apostles\] were not yet certain He had risen again. Christ knew what they were thinking and replied that by touching His real body they could know He was not a spirit. The Apostles had had the same suspicion and fear before the Passion when they saw Him walking on water. They had been reproved on that occasion, not because they thought that ghosts \[spectra\] sometimes do exist, but because they thought it was not Christ who was then appearing to them.
[Page 147]

That others had the same opinion at the time is demonstrated from \[a passage\] by St Luke. When Rhoda told the whole Church which was in Jerusalem that Peter had been freed from prison and was standing at the gate, \[Acts 12.1415\] they said she was mad, because they were fully persuaded that Peter was alive and being kept in prison. They knew the soul of a living person could not appear outwith his body, and so they rebuked the girl\'s mistake \[in thinking\] it was the soul of a living person. They thought it was an angel disguised as Peter. Had they believed Peter was dead, they would have agreed with the girl. In this passage, the Greek word \[used\] is áγγεdos \[angel\].

So, the passage proves that sometimes souls are represented by angels, ÉTEPOTPOWNWS \[taking on a different appearance\]. But the preceding passages by Luke in the Gospels do not have but quite clearly have Tò πveûµα \[spirit\]. In Matthew, the word is фávtaoua \[ghost\]. My considered opinion about these \[words\] is this. In Matthew, the word is used as a generic term, and so we may understand that this opinion is as much about angels as it is about souls. In Luke, the phrase Tò πveûµα is used, and so we may restrict it to souls, or at least not restrict it to angels alone. In Luke in the Acts, the word \'angel\' is used, and so we may realise that when it comes to angels, the Church has had one and the same opinion. Certainly \[φávtaopa and πveûµα\] are more or less indistinguishable, and the result is that the Sadducees of old and the heretics of today attack both equally.

But who cannot laugh at \[Ludwig\] Lavater\'s argument that πveûµα simply means \'angel\'? So when the flesh resists the \'spirit\' in our bodies, it is not resisting the soul, but an angel, because St Paul uses the word πveúµatos, \[Galatians 5.17\]. So according to Peter, Christ\'s soul met angels, not human beings while they were spending time in prison, (Èv филаки πveúµαoi), contrary to the common agreement of antiquity, Peter 3.19\]. So, in the \'hymn to the three children\' \[Daniel 3.26-45\], did Athanasius incorrectly use πveúpata to signify human souls? But I fritter away my time when I take such things seriously and disprove them.

Book 2, Question 26, Section 5

Now let me come to what has been said by \[Church\] Councils, \[Church\] Fathers, and \[Church\] historians, my intention being that what \[they say\] tells us this in no unintelligible manner and convinces us of it, (unless we are shameless and obstinate, which is a special mark of heretics). Let me cut off one way of escape for them-that certain people deny all visions. Let me make it clear that these people have not written anything worthwhile because, by using the same claim of right, each of them decides for himself which of all the historical books is not part of the sacred canon, making it up today and changing his mind tomorrow, as he pleases, and so they are able to refuse to accept \[both\] faith and authority. What is more insane than this? What is more pernicious for every part of the state and more worthy of serious punishment?

Others are more restrained. They allow and accept visions of angels, but only when it pleases them to do so, (when they don\'t give them trouble during a disputation!) But these same people understand every ancient account as follows: that the souls, even of the blessed, have never appeared and do not ever appear αůtonpoowπws \[in their own person\], (as they express it), but say that whenever one reads such accounts, one must take it to be referring to an apparition actually done by good or bad spirits \[spiritus\]. The rule of St Augustine and others-that when the words of Scripture can be translated in their strict sense, one should not have recourse to metaphorical or other figurative senses-is against these people, and most of the Scriptural words dealing with these subjects are so clear that anyone who applies them in a figurative sense cannot, in accordance with that same rule, distort them in this fashion at all.
[Page 148]

Secondly, there is nothing irrational which constrains us \[to believe in apparitions\], and I have said already that nothing too little consonant with reason can happen, is appropriate to happen, or is to our advantage to happen \[if we do believe in them\]. So why can we not believe very holy, very serious people when they tell us straightforwardly and without pretence that these \[apparitions\] take place aútorpoownws \[in their own person\], but \[feel obliged\] to thrust the word éteponpoownws \[looking like someone else\] upon them even if they do not want it as though, in the very way they talk about both kinds, they have not told us \[what kind of\] apparition it is? Doesn\'t St Cyprian, (to omit others), simply use the word \'visions\' when he is talking about one which takes place in the imagination and one which is done by angels, but when he talks about an apparition of one of the blessed, he adds that \'such and such\' a person appeared? The Acts of the Martyrs makes the same distinction, and so do the Life and the Dialogues of St Gregory. (See Cyprian, Letters 10, 11, 12, and 69; the Acts of the Martyrs in \[Laurent\] Sauer under 24th February and ist May; and St Gregory\'s dialogues passim.) But angels, too, have been accustomed to make clear this very point when they appear, as did the Archangel Gabriel when he provided a vision of himself in the shape of St Marcellinus. (See Eginhard, The Translation \[and Miracles\] of St Marcellinus and St Peter, Book 3, chapter 12.)

First Century

We had the first church in Spain, perhaps in the whole of Europe, dedicated by St James, son of Zebedee, to the Mother of God, St Mary of the Pillar, near the Ebro at Zaragoza. This was reported in the annals of Celtiberia and also accepted by such a firm tradition of the church there that no Catholic in that area has any doubts about it. The tradition is that the Blessed Virgin appeared to the Apostle of Spain standing on a pillar and ordered him to dedicate a small shrine to her on that spot. It is now a rich and noble church. If she appeared in a vision to St James where he was living while she was still alive elsewhere, why can the Queen of Heaven and earth not \[appear\] these days when she pleases? In a moment I shall demonstrate that she has often been pleased to do so. Her son has appeared more than once, so why not His mother as well? Christ showed Himself unmistakably to St Peter while \[Peter\] was running away from persecution, and said He was taking Himself off to Rome to be crucified again. Peter understood what the Lord meant, turned back, and was taken to a cross. So, this is how Christ was crucified again in Peter. (St Ambrose, Against Auxentius on Handing over New Basilicas \[13\], St Gregory on the fourth penitential psalm, and Hegesippus, The Ruin of Jerusalem Book 3, chapter 2 bear witness to this). In letter 8, addressed to Demophilus, \[section 6\], St Dionysius the Areopagite tells us that Jesus, accompanied by many angels, appeared to Carpus of Crete and rebuked him because he was looking for the punishment of a lapsed brother, someone who was leading people astray; and during the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, there lived St Martial, Bishop of Limoges, a disciple of Christ. He saw the soul of the martyr St Valeria going up to Heaven like a bright flame. (This story is told in the Acts of St Martial in \[Laurent Sauer\]).

Second Century

In his second Defence, addressed to the Emperors, Justin Martyr says that the souls of the dead return and sometimes appear, and he uses the pagans\' actual evocations made by magicians to persuade them that \[souls\] are therefore immortal; and in his dispute with Trypho he claims that Samuel\'s soul really was evoked. Tertullian has no disagreement at all with what I am saying, but only with magical incantations when he says, \'But if God\'s power has called back certain souls into their bodies as proofs of His right \[to do so\], this will not therefore be shared by the self-confidence and audacity of magicians, the deceptiveness of dreams, and poets\' \'freedom of speech\', \[The Soul 57.12\]. He also makes the truth clear for us because he hints that this has sometimes been done, and he adds the reason for its having been done. He also makes an even clearer statement about the soul. \'If anyone asks about someone who has been dead for a long time as though he were still alive, the answer comes back straight away, \"He has \[life\] now and is obliged to come back\".
[Page 149]

These testimonies of the soul are as straightforward as they are true, as widespread as they are straightforward, as commonly believed as they are widespread, as commonly believed as they are natural, and as divine as they are natural, \[The Testimony of the Soul 4.11-5.1\]. This can refer not only to the resurrection of bodies, but also to the miraculous return of souls. Origen correctly thought that certain \[souls\] can return, but this is not at all satisfactory for us under the present circumstances because he restricted \[that return\] to the souls of the wicked. In Book 7, \[chapter 5\] of Against Celsus, \[he says\], \'A soul which is wicked and has been dragged back to earth by its vicious wrongdoing in such a way that it cannot even aspire to higher things wanders about and roams the earth, now flitting about in the neighbourhood of tombs where the phantoms of shadowy spirits are quite often seen, now traversing these pieces of land. What kind of spirits should we believe these are, which in every age have been confined and hobbled by acts of poisonous magic \[veneficiis\]?\' etc.

There is no doubt that in Origen\'s time, St Potamiaena appeared to Basilides, her executioner, and converted him to the Faith, and not only him, but several others, too, as Eusebius tells us in his \[History of the Church\] Book 6, chapter 4; and Origen himself, in Against Celsus Book 1, \[chapter 46\], testifies, \'Many have been brought to the Christian religion, more or less unwillingly, by some kind of spirit \[spiritu\] which suddenly changed their mind in such a way that, after they had been shown visions either while they were asleep or while they were awake, they would then not hesitate to go to meet death on behalf of the Word whom they had hated. I have seen many such instances, and if, in what I am writing here, I were to recount merely what they did, unbelievers would start to jeer, thinking I was making it up just like those they wrongly suspect are doing so. God, however, is witness to my conscience that I am trying to make people favourable towards Jesus\'s teaching, not by telling deceitful anecdotes, but by giving true examples.\' This is what he says, and I myself could undoubtedly put \[such examples\] before \[Ludwig\] Lavater, \[Johannes\] Rivius, and similar unbelievers, and cram almost every page with them.

Third Century

St John the Evangelist, along with the Mother of God, appeared to St Gregory the Miracle-Worker, as St Gregory of Nyssa, \[Gregory\'s\] very important biographer, tells us in a style which may be accurate, but is also long-winded. When the vision is that of an angel, he usually elaborates upon it, as he does in the visions given to St Ephrem. (See Gregory\'s biography of him). St Cyprian also makes mention of night visions in Letter 12, and in Letter 69 he severely rebukes those who reject visions of this kind.

The martyred son of St Quartillosa appeared and confirmed that his mother had been martyred. The story is told in the letter of African confessors which Laurent Sauer produced in Vol. 1, under 24th February, and in an expansion to it, St Cyprian, too, is said to have appeared to the confessors Montanus and Flavianus to encourage them. Other authentic Acts of the Martyrs of Sidra, reproduced by Sauer, (Volume 3, under ist May), say that St Cyprian appeared to Marianus and stretched out his hand, and that a child-martyr was seen by Agapius just before \[the child\] received his crown \[of martyrdom\]. In sermon 90, St Ambrose says that St Agnes appeared to her parents while they were keeping constant vigil one night at her tomb. She was accompanied by a large number of virgins and spoke to \[her parents as follows. \'Please don\'t mourn me now that I am dead, Mother and Father, because I am alive in Heaven with these virgins in the presence of Him whom I loved with all my heart \[while I was\] on earth\'. \[Sauer\] adds that several years later, while Constantia was asleep, \[St Agnes\] promised her health and fulfilled her promise. Earlier, too, during the reign of Decius, St Peter appeared to St Agatha in prison, and restored her breast to her. (Acts of St Agatha, under 5th February, in Sauer.) Later, \[St Agnes\] appeared to St Lucia and freed her mother Eutychia from a bloody flux, (Acts of St Lucia, under 13th December, in Sauer).
[Page 150]

After 300AD, or Fourth Century

Christ our Lord deigned to appear to St Peter of Alexandria in the form of a child looking for its clothes which had been torn by Arius, (Sauer, Volume 6, under 15th November). In Volume 2 of his letters and decretals, \[Pope\] Hadrian says that in the prefaces to Synod VII, or the Second Council of Nicaea, Acts 2, after the blessed Emperor Constantine was converted to the Christian faith, one reads the following: \'When the day was at an end and silence fell and it was time to go to sleep, lo and behold, the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, suddenly appeared to the King, saying, \"Since you have put an end to your disgraceful crimes and have developed a horror of shedding the blood of innocents, we have been sent by the Lord Jesus Christ to give you advice on how to recover soundness of mind. So, you have heard our warnings\", etc.

Notice they say they were sent by Christ, and that they are said to have appeared to the King unmistakably αůtonpoowπws \[in their own persons\]. They are called \'Apostles\'. In other visions which came to Constantine while he was fighting, those who appeared in them were not named, because they were angelic spirits, (Zonaras, \[Historical Extracts\] Volume 3). The following also happened. When Constantine ordered the building of a church for the Mother of God. She herself appeared to the architect and instructed him where the pillars could be erected. (Gregory of Tours, The Glory of the Martyrs, chapter 8). Spiridion and Tryphillus earlier appeared to Constantius while he was asleep and cured him, and yet they were still alive. (From \[St Simeon\] Metaphrastes in Sauer, Volume 6, under 12th December). It is as possible to manage to have a conversation with a dead person as it is to get him to appear.

Socrates, (\[History of the Church\] Book 1, chapter 8 \[12\]) and Rufinus, (\[History of the Church\] Book 1, chapter 5), say this in connection with that same Spiridion. Let me quote what Rufinus says. \'He had a daughter called Irene and when she had looked after him well, she died, a virgin. After her death, someone came along saying he had entrusted something to her keeping. Her father said he had no knowledge of this, \[but\] he searched the whole house diligently. He did not find what he was looking for anywhere, but the man who had entrusted it \[to Irene\] persisted and went on pressing the matter with wailing and tears. He kept swearing he would put an end to his life unless he recovered what he had entrusted to her. Moved by the man\'s tears, the elderly \[father\] hurried off to his daughter\'s tomb and started calling her by name. Then, from the tomb, she said, \"What do you want, Father?\" \"Where did you put what that man entrusted to you?\" he asked. She told him where it was. \"You will find it buried there\", she said. He went back home, found the object, just as his daughter had told him from the tomb in answer to his question, and handed it back to the man who had kept on asking for it\'.

Of course, it was possible for her to have replied and not appear, just as it was in the case of those who, although already dead, added their signatures to the Synod of Nicaea. Gregory of Caesarea, a priest, reported an extraordinary story. (See \[Luigi\] Lippomano, Volume 6, \'A Discourse on the Synod of Nicaea\'.) \'Two holy bishops\', he said, \'Chrysanthus and Musonius, had not yet appended their signatures to \[the Synod\'s\] decree, and it happened that, by divine providence, they departed this human life. So, the holy fathers \[of the Synod\] came to the place where \[the two bishops\] were sleeping together \[in death\], and once \[the Fathers\] were with them, \[the bishops\] heard what was being said. \"Brethren and fathers\", said \[the Synod Fathers\], \"you have fought a magnificent fight along with us, you have finished the race, you have preserved the Faith. So, if you decide that what \[the Synod\] has done is pleasing to God, (because you now perceive \[things\] in a purer way), let there be nothing to stop you from signing this decree as well\". They all said this together, put their seals on the decree, put it in the bishops\' coffin, and spent the whole of that night awake in prayer. Next day, when they came to the coffin, they found that the seals they had attached \[to the decree had been broken, and when they unrolled the holy decree, they found that the holy bishops\' signatures had been added to it\'. Nicephorus, (\[History of the Church\] Book 8, chapter 23), adds the words which had been written at the bottom. \'Chrysanthus and Musonius. We took part in the first holy ecumenical Synod \[of Nicaea\] with all the fathers, and even though we have been removed in body, we have still appended our signatures to this document in our own hand.\'
[Page 151]

From this it is clear that Spiridion and of all the fathers at the First Synod \[of Nicaea\] thought that, with God\'s permission, souls are able to return to us, because otherwise he would not have invoked his daughter and \[the bishops\] would not have asked for a signature. A provincial Council, older than that held in Nicaea seeing that it happened before Constantine while a persecution \[of Christians\] was still going on, took place in Spain in Elvira, and in its Canon 34 we read, \'The spirits of the dead should not be disturbed\' which makes it clear that the spirits of the dead survive and know what is happening near their tombs. From this it also follows that sometimes they are present in those places, and that pagan rituals, springing from error, which are concerned with souls\' flitting round their tombs for a hundred \[days\], are abominable. This is what I think the canon is referring to, and Nemesius does not seem to disagree entirely with this opinion in his Пері Yuxns \[The Soul\], a book which is wrongly attributed to Nicenus.

In 366 the Emperor Julian was killed by the spearhead of an unidentified individual. St Basil had a vision of this before it happened. St Mercurius appeared to him, along with the Blessed Virgin, and as \[the saint was leaving, he was carrying a bloody spear, as St \[John\] of Damascus, relying on Helladius, one of St Basil\'s disciples, reported in his Holy Images 1. At the same time, too, someone else, while making his way to the camp, saw, either while he was awake or while he was dreaming, several of the Apostles and prophets gathered together, looking into the wrongs Julian had done to the Church and generally reflecting upon them. Two of their number urged the rest to be of good courage and left and, returning to the company not long afterwards, informed it that the tyrant had been killed. Sozomen tells this story in his \[History of the Church\] Book 6, chapter 2, but leaves out the names of the two men. Nicephorus, however, added that the two were once the famous soldiers and martyrs, Mercurius and Artemius. (See his \[History\] Book 10, chapter 35). St Febronia, virgin and martyr, used to appear every year on her birthday at midnight, during night prayers, to everyone in the choir, occupying the very place where she used to sing the psalms. (\[St Simeon Metaphrastes in Sauer, Volume 3, under 15th June.) St Antony saw the soul of St Ammon, accompanied by angels, going to Heaven, (Athanasius, Life of St Antony; Palladius says the same in his Life of Ammon). The Blessed Virgin came down from Heaven and appeared to St Martin, Bishop of Tours, and the soul of the robber who was revered as a martyr rose from the dead \[and appeared to him\], (Sulpicius Severus in his Life of St Martin). St Athanasius in his Life of \[St\] Antony and St Jerome in his Life of St Martin tell us that the soul of St Paul, the first hermit, appeared to St Antony, borne to Heaven by angels.

Nemesius, whom I cited just now, was of the same opinion. So was St Basil in his book True Virginity, just before the middle where, after saying that even when she is alone, a virgin should always stand in awe of the presence of God and her guardian angel, he adds, \'Why should I go through every detail? There are countless numbers of angels as well as the most blessed spirits of the holy Fathers \[of the Church\]. There is not one of them who could not contemplate individual things anywhere, and even if \[these angels and spirits\] are not at all visible to the eyes of the flesh, they embrace and recognise these things with their nonphysical eyes and understand everything.\' He means, therefore, that the souls of the saints are with us when they wish to be and that, when God gives His permission, there is nowhere they cannot go on in successive stages-don\'t have idle thoughts that they are at all ubiquitous-and that there is nothing in relation to Nature and human actions which they cannot understand at any time. In his panegyric of St Mamas the Martyr, St Basil signifies that St Mamas had appeared to many people. Remember the martyr\', he says, \'as often as you get a sight of him by dreaming about him\'; and in his oration in praise of Caesarius, St Gregory of Nazianzus says his brother often appeared to him while he was asleep, and although he adds, \'whether because of my strong desire \[to see him\]\'-that is to say, those who love fashion dreams for themselves--- \'or in reality\', this is clear testimony of his opinion that it is possible for souls to appear \[to the living\]. (Several of the Fathers I need to cite live in this century. But because their deaths and the greater part of their lives fall into the following century, I have postponed \[mention of them\] until then).
[Page 152]

\[Fifth Century\]

The period between 400 and 500 should be ascribed to the fifth century and had men who were very well-known for their sanctity as well as their learning. The passing of St Martin was shown to St Severinus and St Ambrose while neither of them was present, and he also appeared in order to bring help to those who were preparing to translate his body. He appeared, not just once, elsewhere, as Gregory of Tours says in his books The Miracles of St Martin and The Glory of the Confessors. Herodias had ordered that St John the Baptist\'s head be buried very deep, and many centuries later the saint himself appeared to two monks while they were asleep and showed them where it was; and although the memory of that place was lost and people did not know where \[the head\] was hidden, before Marcian became Emperor St John pointed out, in an extraordinary way, to a monk, Marcellus, the spot where his head was buried. (Prosper and Sigisbert in Sozomen\'s History \[of the Church\] Book 8, chapter 21 and Nicephorus, \[History of the Church\] Book 12, chapter 49).

St Ambrose found out where the bodies of Saints Gervase and Protase were buried from a vision he had of them, as St Augustine bears witness, (The City of God Book 22, chapter 8 and Confessions Book 9, chapter 7.) The words of St Ambrose himself confirm this opinion of mine as well when, in the same sense as St Basil, he testifies that the spirits \[spiritus\] of the saints exist everywhere. \'All saints, wherever they may be, do good to everyone, although those who have undergone tortures on our behalf are especially intercessors for us, because when a martyr suffers, he does not suffer only for himself, but for the citizens, too\', (Sermon 77 on the feast of St Octavius, St Adventor, etc.)

In his biography of St Ambrose, St Paulinus-perhaps \'the Deacon\', not St Paul of Nola-says, \'On the day he died, as it says in a letter which Simplicianus, his successor, a venerable man, received and which was addressed to him from the east, as though \[Ambrose\] were still alive with us-the letter is held permanently in a monastery in Milan-he appeared to certain holy men, praying with them and laying his hands on them. The letter is dated the day on which it was sent, and when we read it, we found it was the day on which \[Ambrose\] died.

In Tuscany, in the city of Florence, where the holy man Zenobius is now bishop, because he had promised he would visit them quite often, he was frequently seen praying at an altar in the church of Sant\'Ambrogio which he had had built there. (I was told this by the holy priest Zenobius.) In the same house in which he stayed to avoid Eugenius when Rhadagaisus was laying siege to \[Milan\] and the men of the city had already mentally given up hope, he appeared to someone in a vision and promised he would be with them on another day. At this, the citizens\' spirits were raised, and on the second day Stilicho arrived with his army and was victorious over the enemy.

(I learned this from Pansophia, a devout woman, mother of the boy Pansophius). He appeared to Mazcezel, who was despairing of his own safety and that of the army he was leading against Gildo, in a vision at night. He was holding a walking-stick in his hand and when Mazcezel prostrated himself at the saint\'s feet, the old man struck the earth with the stick he was using to help himself along, (and this was the third time he had appeared to Mazcezel in this guise), and said, \"Here, here, here!\" indicating the spot and giving then man whom he had thought worthy of this visitation to understand that he should realise he would gain victory on the third day in the very place in which he had seen the Lord\'s saintly priest. Thus, he began and ended the war, free from anxiety. (When I was appointed to Milan, I learned all this from what Mazcezel himself had said because in the see in which I now hold an appointment, \[Mazcezel\] had given an account of it to a very large number of priests, and so I thought I could quite safely add to this book what I found out earlier from them.)
[Page 153]

In Milan we also received, with the greatest reverence, the relics of the martyrs Sisinnius and Alexandrinus who, in my time, after St Ambrose\'s death, gained the crown of martyrdom in the district of Agaunum because of persecutions by the heathen. I found out that a blind man arrived and said he had received his sight on the same day he touched the coffin in which the saints\' relics were being carried. In a vision at night, \[he said\], he had seen a ship approaching the coast, and in it there was a large number of men clad in white. While they were disembarking, he begged one of them to inform him who those men were and was told they were \[St\] Ambrose and his companions. When he heard that name, he prayed he might receive his sight, and the man said to him, \"Go to Milan and present yourself to my brethren who are going to come on\", (and he named the day), \"and you will receive your sight\". The \[blind\] man was from the coast of Dalmatia and kept saying he had never come to the city before until he made his way straight to the saints\' relics. But as soon as he touched them, he began to see\'.

This is what Paulinus has to say about \[St\] Ambrose, and his information is certainly reliable. All right! Now let me deal with someone else from this century-Prudentius, one of St Ambrose\'s colleagues, \[who wrote\] \'Against Symmachus\'. Here is Prudentius on St Eulalia.

\'The virgin, desiring a speedy death, Sought out and drank in the pyre with her mouth From which suddenly a dove sprang forth, Whiter than snow. It was seen To leave the martyr\'s mouth and make for the stars. This was Eulalia\'s spirit \[spiritus\], As white as milk, swift, and innocent.

On St Fructuosus and his friends.

\'A servant from the Governor\'s household saw The sky open to let the martyrs in And the illustrious men being carried through the stars. Yes, and he pointed it out to his master\'s little daughter And made her see the sign of her father\'s crimeThat those whom his law-court had killed were now alive in Heaven\'.

When, with devout enthusiasm, each of the brothers later tried to carry off some of the relics for himself, \[Prudentius\] adds, \'But lest they separate the relics, which were to be raised up again And soon exist together with the Lord, By burying them in different places, \[The martyrs\] were seen, clad in snow-white robes.

They gave instructions that the dust which would be treated as holy Be given back, mixed together, and enclosed in hollow marble\'.

In chapter 17 of his biography of St Germain d\'Auxerre, the priest Constantinus writes, \'The holy man was staying, undaunted, in a house infested with spectres when suddenly, right in front of a man who was reading a book, there stood a dreadful ghost \[umbra\] which, little by little drew itself erect before his eyes as he looked at it. Showers of stones were being thrown at the walls, too, so the man who had been reading was absolutely terrified and begged the priest to protect him. \[The saint\] immediately jumped up, looked the dreadful figure in the face and, first invoking the name of Christ, ordered it to say who it was and what it was doing there. \[The ghost\] laid aside its frightening lack of reality at once and spoke in a humble voice, like a suppliant, \[saying\] that he and a close friend had committed many crimes and were lying unburied, and that the reason they were disturbing people was that they themselves were unable to be at peace. He asked \[the saint\] to pray to the Lord for them so that they might deserve to receive rest. This made the holy man feel sorry \[for them\] and he told \[the ghost\] to show him where they were lying. Then, carrying a taper in front of him, the ghost led the way ahead and, in the dead of night, pointed out the spot where they had been thrown out among buildings which were in a state of complete ruin. When daylight had returned to the world, \[the saint\] called together people from the neighbourhood and, giving them a good example, applied himself to the work and encouraged them to clear away the old rubbish which had been thrown hurriedly on top of \[the bodies\]. When they had pulled it off with rakes, they found the bodies spreadeagled in a disorderly fashion, their bones still bound tightly with iron \[chains\]. \[The saint\] arranged for a grave to be dug in accordance with the law; the bodies were freed from their chains and clothed in pieces of linen; soil was thrown on top of them and they were buried; a prayer of intercession was said over \[the grave\], and the dead obtained their rest. As a result, after that day the house flourished, many people came to live in it, and there was no sign of \[its former\] horror\'. (See Sauer, under the month of July.)
[Page 154]

But let me throw in the authority and teachings of the Fathers \[of the Church\] along with all these examples which are so clear. (I shall return to other examples in a moment). In his book, Against Vigilantius, St Jerome, with a single example, slays all the innovators of our own day with the sword of sacred truth overlaid with golden plates of eloquence. \'You say the souls of the Apostles and the martyrs have a place in Abraham\'s bosom, or the place of consolation, or beneath God\'s altar, and that they cannot be in their graves and also wherever they like. They are, so to speak, of Senatorial rank, and are not shut up among murderers in a noise-some prison, but in unrestrained, honourable custody in the Islands of the Fortunate and the Elysian Fields. Will you constrain God with laws? Will you chain up the Apostles so that they are confined in custody until the Day of Judgement and are not with their Lord, even though it has been written, \"They follow the Lamb wherever He goes\"? If the Lamb \[is\] everywhere \[ubique\], it follows that they, too, who are with the Lamb are everywhere \[ubique\]; and when the Devil and evil spirits roam all over the globe and can be present everywhere \[ubique\] with unimaginable speed, will the martyrs be shut up in a box after they have shed their blood, and be unable to come out of it?\' \[Section 6\]. Substitute \'in any place at all\' \[ubilibet\] for \'everywhere\' \[ubique\], Reader-which is how I translated St Basil-and bear in mind at the same time that St Jerome\'s arguments cab also overturn those who deny that the souls of the saints can come out of Heaven.

In his book, Care for the Dead, St Augustine, a friend and admirer of St Jerome, is almost entirely in agreement that he proves that, according to God\'s usual law, souls cannot, of their own simple, unadorned natural ability, come out of the places to which they have been assigned, but that with God\'s exceptional permission, they can leave their reliquaries when they want, in order to be seen by human beings. Notice what he means when he says this. It is made absolutely clear by the contents of his argument. When he wrote in chapter 10 that the dead were said to have appeared to the living and that \[the living\] did not know where these people\'s bodies were lying unburied, and that \[the dead\] showed them the places and urged them to give them the burial they had not had, he adds, \'If we answer that these \[reports\] are not true, contrary to what a number of the faithful have written, and contrary to their own senses which confirm that such things have happened to them, people will think us impudent.⁴⁰ (Are not my opponents impudent when they boo the consensus of all ages off the stage?) But, so that we might understand that this does not happen by God\'s usual law, but by His particular ordinance and singular permission, \[St Augustine\] wrote of his mother in chapter 13 something my opponents fraudulently misrepresent to my discredit. \'If the souls of the dead were interested in the affairs of the living-and I cannot speak for other people-my mother would not fail to visit me conscientiously every night.

He also said clearly elsewhere, (chapter 15), in relation to that singular permission, something he did not say about \[God\'s\] usual law which is connected with it. \'Holy Scripture bears witness that apparitions of the dead are sent to the living and confirms this with those of Samuel and Moses\'. St Augustine therefore had every confidence in this and later, in chapter 16, he says that the confessor Felix \[appeared\] when Nola was being attacked by uncouth foreigners, and that he himself knew this not only from the benefits it brought, but also from the looks on people\'s faces, and not just because of unreliable rumours, but because there were reliable witnesses. \'But,\' he adds, \'these things are occasioned by divine providence in a way which is quite different from that in which things usually happen, which is \[the way\] which has been assigned to each individual type of created thing\'. The saintly Doctor therefore means that this can happen, but that it does not happen naturally and, in order to make this clear, he added a few lines later, \'Some things represent the limits of human experience, others are signs of God\'s power. There are some things which happen naturally, and others which happen miraculously, although God is also present in Nature so that this can happen, and Nature is not lacking in miracles.\'
[Page 155]

Miracles, of course, do indeed happen beyond the natural order, but they are never at odds with the natural character things have. What makes a louder sound than this trumpet of truth? What is clearer than this light of the Church? What do heretics dread more intensely than this hammer of falsehood? The author of the letter to Cyril of Jerusalem, (attributed, albeit falsely, to St Augustine), testifies that the spirits of the dead have taken an interest in what the living do, have assisted those who are still alive, and have been seen in our world. He tells us that St Jerome\'s soul appeared to him at the very time Jerome died and gave him a lot of good advice and learned instruction.

The authority and trustworthiness of this letter, however, are very small or non-existent, so let me turn to someone else. St \[John\] Chrysostom\'s homily 74, on John, acknowledges that the dead appear in dreams and that this was the opinion of the Apostle Jude Thaddaeus. In the homily he writes that one might think this was how Christ would appear after His death only to the Apostles and not to others. In Palladius we read that two brothers, Paesius and Isaias, were seen in the heavens by St Pambo, (in the section on \'Paesius and Isaias\'), that his dead brother was seen by Father Apollo, (in the section on \'Apollo\'), and that Anuph had seen the choirs of the blessed and that later on many people saw his soul lifted into Heaven by large numbers of angels and martyrs, (in the section on \'Anuph\').

Palladius was in the habit of explaining things clearly, and distinguishing between the vision of an angel and the vision of a soul, and he added that the angel had taken on human appearance, as you can see in chapter 86 which is about Evagrius the Deacon who was discouraged by the vision of an angel from loving a lecherous woman. In this chapter, too, you have a clear distinction between \[that and\] the apparition of evils spirits who were trying to lead him to heretical blasphemy.

Marcus of Gaza lived at almost the same time. He tells a story, of which he was an eye-witness, about the delegation of Bishop John of Caesarea and Bishop Porphyrius of Gaza to \[the Emperor\] Arcadius \[seeking permission to demolish the Marneion. In this account along with everything else he describes a very severe storm which God had allowed to rise because of the heretical wickedness of a ship\'s captain. \'We began to call upon \[him, using\] the prayers of St Procopius the Hermit, and when evening had come and the storm had not abated, we remained awake the whole night. Round about morning, however, after a great deal of suffering, the very holy bishops slept a little and, during sleep, my lord Porphyrius saw St Procopius the Hermit who spoke to them. \"Teach the ship\'s captain the catechism\", he said, \"seal him again-because he is a member of Arius\'s hateful sect-make sure he curses Arius and his wicked faith, and this great storm will abate at once\". Then \[Marcus\] adds that this happened and the sea grew calm.

Proclus of Constantinople saw St Paul helping and giving instructions to St \[John\] Chrysostom as \[John\] was writing his commentaries on St Paul\'s Epistles-this is reported, in writing, by Leo Augustus and \[St Simeon\] Metaphrastes in a Life of St \[John\] Chrysostom-and when \[St John\] was coming back from exile, St Basiliscus the Martyr, who suffered some time before in Nicomedia, appeared to him in the church in Comana, saying, \"Take heart, John, because tomorrow we shall be together\'. They say the martyr had also appeared earlier to the church\'s priest and had said, \'Prepare a place for Brother John, because he is about to come \[to Heaven\]\'. Palladius tells the story in his Dialogue⁴⁰ and adds that he confirmed this had happened, because the next day the saintly bishop died and was buried there \[in Comana\]. St Cyril of Alexandria, who was very much at odds with St Chrysostom was told in his sleep by the Mother of God to make his peace with the dead man. (Nicephorus, History \[of the Church\] Book 14, chapter 28, relying on Nicetas.)
[Page 156]

I shall pass over another vision dealing with St Chrysostom\'s glory, that of Adelphius, which was written down by Sophronius in his Spiritual Meadow, chapter 128, and quite rightly rejected by \[Cesare\] Baronio, \[Annals of the Church\] Volume 5, under the year 407. But an anecdote about Synesius, Bishop of Cyrene, and Evagrius the Philosopher, which Sophronius wrote, (relying on Leontius), in his Spiritual Meadow, chapter 195 is perfectly trustworthy. Synesius was constantly trying to convert \[Evagrius\] to the Christian religion, and \[Evagrius\] kept on objecting to Christian teaching on the resurrection of the body, the reward for good works, especially the hundredfold return after this life for one\'s almsgiving, and used to say he could not but think this was a fairy-tale. But in the end the Bishop, who spared no pains \[to convert him\], persuaded him to become a Christian and baptised him along with his children.

\'Not long after he had been baptised, he gave the Bishop three hundred gold pieces to be used for the benefit of the poor, saying, \"Take this gold, distribute it to the poor, and write me a bond in your own hand, saying that Christ will honour it in the next life\". \[Synesius\] took the gold and readily wrote the bond, as Evagrius had asked.

The philosopher lived for several years after his baptism, but at length he became mortally ill, and when he was near death he said to his sons, \"When you are making the arrangements for my funeral, put this document in my hands and bury it with me\". After his death, his sons did as he had instructed and buried him with the handwritten bond.

On the third day after the burial, he appeared to Bishop Synesius while he was sleeping at night, and said, \"Come to the tomb where I am lying and take your bond, because I have received what I was owed and have had satisfaction; and so that you can be assured of this, I have signed it in my own hand\".

Now, the Bishop did not know the bond had been buried with him, but next morning he summoned Evagrius\'s sons and said, \"Tell me, did you put anything in the tomb with your father?\"

Thinking he was asking about money, they said, \"Nothing, my lord, except the usual grave clothes. Why do you ask?\"

\"Did you, by any chance, bury a document with him?\"

The sons still did not know he was talking about a bond but, after thinking about it, said, \"Oh yes, my lord, when he was dying, he did give us some kind of document and said, \"When you bury me, put this document in my hands, but no one is to know about it\".

Then the Bishop told them the dream he had had that night and took them, along with some clerics and some of the most important of the citizens, to the philosopher\'s tomb. They opened it and found the philosopher lying there, holding in his hands the bond in the Bishop\'s handwriting. They took the bond from his hands, opened it, and found that the following had recently been added to it in the philosopher\'s handwriting. \"I, Evagrius, a philosopher, greet you, most holy Synesius, my lord Bishop. I have received what I was owed according to what you wrote in your own hand in this paper, have been given satisfaction, and have no further claim against you for the gold I have you and, through you, to Christ, our God and Saviour\", etc.

Hugo Eterianus tells the same story in his book, The Return of Souls from the Underworld, chapter 16. St Gamaliel, St Paul\'s teacher, appeared three times on different nights to Lucianus, a holy man and a priest, who was half awake at the time. (\[This happened\] not during the reign of Constantine-Nicetas makes this mistake in his oration on the martyrdom and discovery of St Stephen-but during that of Honorius and Archidius). He pointed out to him where the relics of his body were, and those of St Stephen, the first martyr, St Nicodemus, and St Abibus. They were found there and brought to the west by Orosius. There exists a letter by Lucianus, which describes this clearly, (see Sauer, Volume 4).
[Page 157]

The Spaniard \[Alcimus\] Avitus translated it into Latin from Greek, and a copy of this exists, too. Gennadius \[of Massilia\] mentions it in his Famous Men, chapter 47, and Marcellinus Comes in his Chronicles and Nicephorus in his \[History of the Church\] Book 14, chapter 9 have a favourable opinion of it. So that people would have more trust \[in the authenticity\] of this vision, St Gamaliel also appeared at the same time to Nygetius, a monk, and pointed westwards towards the location of the place, as Lucianus himself records. Evodius is witness that the first martyr himself appeared to several people as well. (See the \[anonymous\] book on the miracles of St Stephen); and one should read Sozomen, \[History of the Church\] Book 7, last chapter for an apparition of Micah and Habbakuk which happened before the ones I have just mentioned.

In Book 9, last chapter, Sozomen says the following about the body of the prophet Zacaraiah, which was discovered not long afterwards. \'Cophar is an estate in the territory of Eleutheropolis in Palestine. This place had an overseer, one Calimerus, a worker on the same estate, who was, to be sure, faithful to his master, but sometimes peevish and awkward and unfair to the neighbouring farmers. But even though he was like this, the prophet revealed himself while he was awake, appearing to him in broad daylight. He pointed out a particular garden and said, \"Please dig there\", etc. and the sacred body was found lying under the designated spot.

Terebon, a Saracen, saw Euthymius at night, although \[Euthymius\] was not in the area and was still alive at the time, and when, later on, \[Euthymius\] had cured him and Terebon had made a journey \[to visit him\], a large number of Saracens embraced the Christian faith. \[This happened\] in the year 420, as Cyril the Monk, an absolutely trustworthy historian has recorded. (See the life of St Euthymius in Sauer, Volume 1, under 20th January).

Round about the year 429 the Blessed Virgin, with St \[John\] the Baptist and St \[John\] the Evangelist, appeared to Father Cyriacus \[the Anchorite\] and said she would not come into his cell. Instead, she stayed outwith the door because, unknown to the Father, there were two books in his cell by Nestorius, an enemy of the Mother of God. (See Sophronius, Spiritual Meadow, chapter 66). Uranus tells a story about St Paulinus of Nola, (see the life of Paulinus in Sauer, Volume 3, under 22nd June). \[The saint\], he says, appeared to him before he died and St Januarius the martyr and St Martin of Tours had a conversation with him. 409 The Apostle Peter and his disciple, St Apollinaris, appeared to and were seen by Pope Sixtus in 433. They suggested that Peter, a very holy and a most eloquent man-truly \'golden of speech\' \[Chrysologus\]-should be made Archbishop of Ravenna. (This comes from the ancient archives of Ravenna in the history of the city by Girolamo Rossi).

In Book 2 of his Vandalic War, Procopius writes that St Cyprian appeared to the Libyans who had been oppressed and told them to be of good heart, and that in a short time he would be their avenger, and indeed the Vandals were routed two years later. In 456, King Theodoric \[II\] conquered the Suevi in Gallaecia \[Galicia\] and marched upon Lusitania \[Portugal\] where he was restrained from destroying the city of Emerita \[Mérida\] by an apparition of the martyr, St Eulalia. (See St Isidore \[of Seville\], History of the Goths, the Vandals, and the Suevi.)

In chapter 147 of The Spiritual Meadow, Sophronius \[i.e. Moschus talks about a letter of St Leo to Flavianus about correct faith, and Father Abbot Menas from the same monastery tells us the following story. \'\[The Abbot said\] he had heard Eulogius, the Patriarch of Alexandria, saying, \"When I went to Constantinople, I enjoyed a close friendship with Master Gregory, the Archdeacon of Rome, a remarkable man, and he told me a story about the most holy and blessed Roman Pontiff, Leo.
[Page 158]

He said that a church in Rome had a written document which said that when \[Leo\] had written a letter to Flavianus, the holy Bishop of Constantinople, against the irreligious Eutyches and Nestorius, he placed it on top of the grave of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, and then spent time in prayer and vigils and fasts. He begged the chief of the Apostles, \"If, because I am simply a human being, I have written something here I should not have done, \[I ask\] you, to whom our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has entrusted both the Church and this See, to put it right\". After four days the Apostle appeared to him and said, \"I have read it and corrected it\". \[Then Leo\] picked up the letter from St Peter\'s tomb, opened it, and found that the Apostle had corrected it in his own hand. In chapter 148 he goes on to say, \'Theodore, the very holy Bishop of Dorna, which is in Libya, told me the following story. \"When I was chamberlain to holy Pope Eulogius, I dreamed I saw a man whose appearance and aristocratic demeanour inspired awe.

He said to me, \"Tell Pope Eulogius I have come\". I said to him, \"Who is it who is telling me to make this announcement?\" He replied, \"I am Leo, the Roman Pontiff\". So, I went in and announced, \"The very holy and blessed Pope Leo, Bishop of the See of Rome, wants to meet you\". When he heard this, Pope Eulogius rose from his seat and ran quickly to meet him. They greeted one another, said a prayer, and then sat down. The distinguished lord Leo said to holy Eulogius, \"Do you know why I have come here to you?\" \"No\", replied Eulogius. \"I have come\", said Leo, \"to thank you for your splendidly correct and proper reply to the letter I sent my brother Flavianus, the Patriarch of Constantinople. You explained my meaning and intention and shut the mouths of the heretics. Please understand, Brother, that you have given your holy labour and exertion not only to me, but also to Peter, supreme head of the Apostles, and to that Truth which is proclaimed to us before all others, Christ our God\". I was reassured by seeing this apparition not merely once, but two and three times, and told the holy Pope Eulogius \[about it\]\'.

In chapter 149, Sophronius \[i.e. Moschus\] says that St Peter appeared to the holy Leo on yet another occasion and told him his sins had been forgiven. Theodoret lived in this century and writes that the Apostles St John and St Philip once appeared to the Emperor Theodosius, (History \[of the Church\] Book 5, chapter 24). In the year 485, when Peter the Fuller was trying to bring the Church in Cyprus under his control, the Apostle St Barbabas appeared three times to Bishop Anthemius of Salamis on three successive night and showed him where his body was buried along with a Gospel of St Matthew written in the Evangelist\'s own hand. Both were found. (Alexander the Monk tells the story at length. See Sauret, Volume 3, under 11th June). I shall be briefer \[in my review\] of the following centuries.

The Sixth Century, that is, after 500AD

Many Severian heretics were converted by various visions-to begin with, for example, Isidore, a monk from Philoxene, \[who was converted\] by an apparition of a man who was damned because he had struck Christ our Lord on the cheek with his hand. (\'Sophronius\' tells the story at length in The Spiritual Meadow, chapter 30.) Then there was Cosmiana, the wife of a patrician Germanus, who was stopped by a visible appearance of the Mother of God and other holy women from entering a church because she was tainted by heresy. (\'Sophronius\', who adds many other examples in chapters 49, 70, 106, 188, and 213. John the Silent appeared in dreams to Regina, a woman from Cappadocia who had the office of deaconess, while he was still alive and living in Lavra, and told her what she needed to do. (Cyril \[of Scythopolis\], a monk, tells the story of this even in his Life of John the Silent. See \[Luigi\] Lippomano, Volume 6.) St Bartholomew appeared in Darae to Anastasius and pointed out where his body had been buried and promised to be the city\'s patron and protector. (See Nicephorus, Book 16, chapter 37). In the year 515 Macedonius \[II\], the Patriarch of Constantinople, who had been driven into exile by the wicked \[Emperor\] Anastasius, died and \[George\] Cedrenus has this to say about him. \'He was about to be put in his tomb, but before this happened, he raised his right hand and made the sign of the cross over it. In a vision he \[also\] said to Theodorus, one of his close friends, \"Listen to this, and go and tell Anastasius that I, Macedonius, am going to my ancestors in whose faith I have continued steadfastly. In the meantime, I shall keep bothering God until you, too, come and our case receives judgement\". (Various accounts of this can be read in Theophanes, \[Chronicle\] Book 15, Anastasius \[the Librarian\], \[Tripartite\] History, and Theodorus Lector, Selections Book 2.)
[Page 159]

But because Macedonius died a schismatic, God appointed others to accuse Anastasius, Catholics whom \[the Emperor\] had also sent into exile. God warned both of them in a vision to prepare themselves because they were going to die ten days after Anastasius\'s death and prosecute their case in front of His dread tribunal. These two were Elias, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Flavianus, the Patriarch of Antioch. (See Cyril \[of Scythopolis\], Acts of St Sabas in Sauret, Volume 6, under 5th December, and \'Sophronius\', The Spiritual Meadow, chapter 35). An old hermit in Lipari saw the soul of Theodoric, King of Italy, brought out with its hands bound, and thrown into Vulcan\'s crater. (Pope St Gregory tells the story in Book 4 of his Dialogues, chapter 30.)

Sometimes it turned out that while he was receiving a vision a person would be brought to a place where souls were being detained, as we are told in the exemplary story of the Nestorian monk whom St Cyriacus entrusted to God\'s care. \'At the ninth hour of the day the brother, who was in his cell, caught sight of someone with a terrifying appearance standing next to him. \"Come and see the truth\", he said, and took hold of \[the monk\] and brought him to a dark, stinking place which was breathing out fire. In those fires \[the monk\] saw Nestorius, Eutyches, Apollinaris, Dioscurus, Severus, Arius, Origen, and a number of others. \"This\", said the apparition, \"is the place which has been prepared for heretics\", etc. (This comes from \'Sophronius\', The Spiritual Meadow, chapter 26.)

When the Emperor Justinian finished building a church for the Apostles, it is agreed, says Procopius, that \'the Apostles, mindful of his good works, appeared to people in order to honour the King; and I say that when a king is devout and religious, the things of God do not withdraw from human beings, but have an earnest desire to mingle with them and spend time conversing with them\'. See Procopius, Justinian\'s Buildings Book 1 where you also see his opinion on the subject of my investigation. The following, taken from the same work, is also pertinent. \'More or less at the end of the Golden Horn, on a rather steep, high spot, a church was dedicated some time ago to St Cosmas and St Damian. Here while Justinian while he was lying asleep, seriously ill and already having the look of death on him-indeed his doctors despaired of him and \[treated him as though he were already\] lying among the dead-those saints appeared to him and cured him\'. Procopius also testifies in Book 1 of his Gothic War that a part of Rome\'s defensive walls was defended by the Apostle St Peter when the city was being besieged by the Goths.

In Book 2, chapter 6 of his History of the Franks, Gregory \[of Tours\] writes that St Stephen was seen to intercede with the Princes of the Apostles for the city of Metz where his relics were kept; and in the year 552 the Blessed Virgin showed herself in visible form to the son of a Jewish glass-worker who had been injured after working at the kiln for three days, and healed him. Later on, he and his mother were baptised. (One can look for a perfectly reliable version of what happened in Evagrius Book 4, chapter 35, because Evagrius was alive at the time. Gregory of Tours relies on him in his book, The Glory of the Martyrs, chapter 8, as does Glykas, Annals Part 4.) While Redemptus, Bishop of Ferentino was keeping watch at the tomb of St Eutychius, the martyr stood near him and said, \'Are you awake, Redemptus?\' Redemptus replied, \'Yes, I am\', and St Eutychius said, \'The end of all flesh is coming\'. (For this and what follows, see St Gregory, Dialogues Book 3, chapter 38.)⁴¹ In about 587, a vision of this kind was given to King Guntram. It was about Chilperic, the Franks\' most wicked tyrant, and King Guntram himself told the story to Gregory of Tours as follows.
[Page 160]

\'I also saw another vision which gave notice of this man\'s death. He was brought in front of me in chains by three bishops-the first was Tetricus, the second Agricola, and the third Nicetius of Lyons. Two of them were saying, \"Please release him \[from his chains\], give him a sound beating, and allow him to go\". Bishop Tetricus, on the other hand, replied bitterly, \"Don\'t do that! Let him be burned to death for his crimes\". While they were, so to speak, wrangling and exchanging high words at length for a long time, I noticed that a bronze cauldron at some distance from them, which had been placed on top of a fire, was boiling fiercely and, as I wept, they seized the unfortunate Chilperic, broke his arms and legs, and threw him into the cauldron. It was not long before he was so dissolved and melted amid the steaming waters that no trace of him whatever remained there\', (Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks Book 8, chapter 5).

Evagrius \[345-399} tells us that Narsetes, a eunuch but also a very famous war leader, left a wicked deed unpunished. \'Those who were with Narsetes remembered that while he was placating God with prayers and other acts of devotion, and paying Him the worship due to Him, the holy Virgin appeared to him and distinctly appointed the time at which he should wage war on the enemy, \[saying\] he should not get ready to join battle with the enemy until he had received a sign from Heaven\'. (Thus Evagrius, talking about Totila and Theia, the kings whom Narsetes defeated, Book 4, chapter 23. Nicephorus tells the same story in Book 17, chapter 13, but his account needs to be explained by reference to Evagrius, because he is not talking about all Narsetes\'s wars, only about the war with the Goths). A little later, while Chosroe was laying siege to Sergiopolis, St Sergius the martyr was seen, with innumerable heavenly defenders, preparing to defend it and running along the walls all over the place. (Nicephorus Book 15, chapter 17, relying on Evagrius Book 4, chapter 27.) While Justinus the Younger was Emperor, first an image of the Mother of God turned its back on Anatolius, an illusionist and an irreligious man, and then the Mother of God herself appeared to several of the faithful and roused them against that wicked man, saying her Son was being troubled by slanders which were coming from Anatolius, (Evagrius Book 15, chapter 18.)

Seventh Century

I have decided to begin the year 600 with the most blessed Gregory I, Roman Pontiff and Doctor of the Church. His authority alone ought to be enough \[to authenticate what follows\]. First, he tells the following story about St Musa. \'One night the blessed Mother of God, the Virgin Mary, appeared to her in a vision and showed her girls of her own age dressed in white garments. Musa wanted to join their company but did not dare do so. The voice of the blessed Virgin Mary asked if she wanted to be with them and live in her service. The girl said, \"I do\", and immediately received an instruction not to behave in a light-minded and girlish fashion and to refrain from laughing and joking, knowing full well that in thirty days\' time she would be entering \[the Virgin\'s\] service along with the virgins she had seen.

After seeing this \[vision\], the girl changed her behaviour entirely and wiped away her girlish light-mindedness with the heavy hand of seriousness. Her parents were astonished at the change in her and when they asked her about it, she told them what the blessed Mother of God had instructed her to do, and on which day she told her she would be entering her service. On the twenty-fifth day she was seized with fever and on the thirtieth, when the hour of her death drew near, she saw the blessed Mother of God coming to her with the girls she had seen in her vision. She began to reply to \[the Virgin\] who was summoning her and, with her eyes respectfully lowered, she called out in a loud voice, \"Look, Lady, I\'m coming\"; and with these words she gave up her spirit\', (Dialogues Book 4, chapter 17). He speaks about St Probus, the Bishop of Reate. The martyrs St Juvenal and St Eleutherius appeared to him and to a child who was with him. They were wearing white stoles and carried Probus\'s soul with them into Heaven, (Dialogues Book 4, chapter 12.)
[Page 161]

These \[examples\] are about celestial \[apparitions\]. Gregory supplies other examples in chapters 11 and 14, and also examples of apparitions of the damned, such as that of Theodoric\'s soul which was seen to be thrown into Vulcan\'s pot, \[and example\] I cited earlier. Hugo Eterianus confirms this in chapter 7 of his book The Return of Souls, and \[St Gregory\], Dialogues Book 4, chapter 51 \[talks\] about a nun who was seen cut in two in front of the altar. \[St Gregory\] adds more about souls which were still expiating their sins. \'Pascanius, a deacon, was seen in Rome, standing in the baths and ministering to the bathers as a punishment for the favour he had shown towards a schismatic, as we are told by the man to whom he appeared-Germanus, Bishop of Capua, by whose prayers he was soon set free from his place of punishment. He tells a fairly similar story about the soul of the owner of a bath-house. Because of his sins, after he died, he was assigned to the hot rooms of the bath-house and ordered to the unremitting service of those who were going to wash. After he had performed this duty more than once for a priest from Civitavecchia, the priest, as a sign of \[fraternal\] affection, brought him two pieces of blessed bread, but he, full of sorrow, said, \"Why are you giving me these, Father? This bread is holy. I can\'t eat it. This person you are looking at was once the owner of this place, but after my death I was assigned \[to work\] here because of my sins. But if you want to help me, offer this bread to Almighty God on my behalf and intercede \[for me\] on account of my sins. You will know He has heard you when you come here to wash and don\'t find me at all.\" With these words he vanished and he, who was a spirit,\' etc. (Op.cit. Book 4, chapter 55). In the same chapter, \[St Gregory\] adds another story about a monk, Justus, who appeared to his brother Copiosus and told him he had escaped punishment because of the offering of the sacrifice of salvation \[the Mass\]. (Glykas gives a slightly different version in part 4 of his Annals). Thus far, then, St Gregory, a man of such merit, holiness, and good sense that no one except a heretic can reject his testimony.

In the same century lived Gregory of Tours and St Isidore of Seville, whose testimonies I have adduced earlier. \'Sophronius\', author of The Spiritual Meadow, was also alive then-and I have already cited several of his testimonies-as was St Ildephonsus \[Hildefuns\], Bishop of Toledo, to whom the Blessed Virgin gave a dazzling white garment when she appeared to him with a large number of virgins. (This garment is still preserved today.) St Leocadia rose from her grave and appeared to him and the King and the whole clergy and people and seemed to be holding out a large cloth in her hand. In order to test whether this apparition was genuine, the King handed St Ildephonsus a knife and \[Ildephonsus\] cut off some of the cloth. (This piece of cloth, along with the knife, has been deposited among the treasures of the Church). Julianus Pomerius, a bishop of the same church, testifies to both \[stories\], (Sauer, Volume 1, under 23rd January.) In 696 a blind man heard Ebroinus being carried off by evil spirits to Vulcan\'s pot, as Ado of Vienne tells us in his chronicle.

Eighth century

After the year 700 there flourished Julianus Pomerius who, in my opinion, lived a little before the laudatory things he said about St Ildephonsus, as did St Suibertus who appeared after his death to sick people whom he \[then\] cured. (See St Marcellinus in chapter 30 of his biography of St Suibertus in Sauer, under the month of March). Likewise, the Venerable Bede, who makes clear he had the same opinion about apparitions in his History of the English \[Church\] Book 4, chapters 14 and 25, and Book 5, chapters 14 and 15, and in other passages of the same book and of the Lives of the Saints he wrote. \[At this time\] too, lived St John of Damascus. When his hand was cut off on the orders of an iconoclast Emperor, the Blessed Virgin Mother of God restored it, as St John, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, tells us in his biography of him.

At this period lived Paul the Deacon who tells us that Arnulf the Langobard was protected in battle by the martyr, St Sabinus, and by a barbarian \[Arnulf\] after he had seen and recognised a painting of the martyr, (History of the Langobards Book 4. Chapter 5). What Bishop Constantine says is entirely worthy of astonishment. He was an eyewitness of the translation of the relics of St Euphemia the Martyr, (see \[Luigi\] Lippomano, Volume 6). Blinded by the splendour of her miracles, Leo Isauricus secretly removed the martyr\'s relics and put dry bones in their place, and threw the genuine relics, along with their reliquary, into the sea waves. Some sailors came upon the reliquary but did not know what it was and, thinking some kind of treasure had been put in it, they took it and opened it and, drenched in the sweet scent which breathed miraculously from it, realised these were holy relics, and although they remained ignorant of whose \[relics\] they were, that same night they saw lights and candles and men shining wonderfully white and praising God.

\'When they landed in Levinum and had gone to sleep, during their repose they saw the martyr Glyceria meet the virgin Euphemia, embrace her, exchange a kiss with her, and congratulate her on her arrival. Then they realised whose the relics were. Three times they set sail from Levinum, and three times they were driven back by contrary winds. Finally, Euphemia stood in front of them in their dreams and told them who she was. She said she wanted to stay there because of what had happened to her after she had been thrown into the sea by the irreligious Leo.\'

Thus, Bishop Constantine who is more believable than Zonaras who attributes these events to \[the reign of\] Copronymus. A little later Zonaras writes of Leo the Armenian as follows. \'These things disturbed the Emperor and a dream his mother had also frightened him. She thought she was in the Church of the Mother of God in Blachernia and saw a lady accompanied by young people who were wearing white garments. The floor of the church was awash with blood, and she heard the lady giving instructions that a dish filled with that blood was to be given to the Emperor\'s mother. When the Emperor\'s mother objected, the lady said, \"But your son fills those who venerate me with blood and does not realise that he is moving God and my Son to anger\". (These words make it clear that the lady was the Blessed Virgin.) Zonaras adds, \'St Tharasius, too, was now translated from this wretched life. Someone saw him, in sleep, calling upon a certain Michael and urging him to seize hold of Leo and kill him\'; and actually Michael Balbus \[Emperor Michael II\] did kill him not long after in 787. St Andrew the Apostle appeared to Aonghus, King of the Picts, and promised him victory, a promise he fulfilled. While \[the King\] was fighting, a red saltire appeared in the sky. (Even though he is a Calvinist, \[George\] Buchanan recorded this in Book 5 of his History of Scottish Affairs, under the sixty-fifth king.) At this time lived St Gertrude, an apparition of whom is mentioned by Louis of Blois more than once in his Spiritual Instruction. Not long afterwards the Roman Empire was transferred to Charlemagne and St James, son of Zebedee, appeared to him and urged him to seize the kingdoms of Spain from Saracen control, as a number of more recent writers have recorded, (Lupold von Bebenburg,

The Zeal of the Ancient \[Kings of France and the German Princes.) Apparitions of St James to Kings of Spain were quite reliably witnessed during this and the following centuries. He promised he would bring them help in battle and was seen to put the enemy to flight during the fighting. The Moors, too, said they saw him and our men boasted of it. (I shall talk about this in a moment.)
[Page 163]

The Ninth Century began with the year 800

In that year Ramirez, King of Spain, fought very bravely for a whole day with a very large number of Saracens and then, under cover of night, retreated with a tiny band of his own men to a particular hill. While the King was staying awake and praying to God, the saint stood near him and told everyone to cleanse themselves by confession and receive the eucharist, and they would win the battle. In the morning everyone to a man complied with the saint\'s instructions, and then they picked up the standards and cut sixty thousand of the enemy to pieces. The Apostle was seen mounted on a white horse during this battle, waving a white flag with a distinctive transverse red cross on it. (See Bishop Rodrigo; the General History of King Alfonso; \[Juan de Mariana, Book 7, chapter 13; and other authors.)

In this century lived Theophylact \[of Ohrid\], the Bulgar, who says in the fourteenth chapter \[of his commentary on St John\'s Gospel that the spirits of the dead appear to the living. I think Julian of Toledo, the Younger, author of Foreknowledge \[of the World To Come\], lived at the same time. In Book 2, chapter 29 he says that \'the dead are able to know what the living are doing\' and, relying on St Augustine\'s opinion in Care for the Dead, he closes the following chapter in almost the same words, \'The authority of Scripture clearly proves that the dead can appear to the living\'. During the reign of Charles the Bald, King of France, someone called Numonis, a usurper of the Church\'s goods, saw and felt St Maurilius who appeared to him, upbraided him loudly, and struck his head with his holy crozier. Nor was the vision in vain. Numonis died a little later. (Annals of Anjou).

Likewise, one reads in Book 2, chapter 62 of the Chronicles of \[Monte\] Cassino that a child caught sight of Pandulf, Prince of Capua, bound with iron restraints, dropped into a muddy, stinking lake right up to his throat. He was being dropped into the deep \[water\] and immediately hauled out again with ropes by two jet-black spirits \[spiritibus\]. The child asked him why this was happening, and he replied, \'Because I stole a golden chalice from St Benedict\'s monastery and failed to put it back \[before\] I was in the throes of death\'. Chapter 84 \[says\] a hermit saw Aethiopians, who said they were evil spirits, laden with straw and preparing a pyre for that same Pandulf: and it was found he had died at that very hour. (I have written this about Pandulf at this point because it has a close bearing on my argument, although of course it happened in the eleventh century.)

After the year 900

While Ludger was looking in vain for the body of St Lebuinus, at length in sleep he had a notion that the very holy priest of Christ was talking to him and telling him where he was buried: and parts of his body were discovered in the place the spirit \[spiritus\] indicated, (Hucbald de Saint-Amand in Sauer, Volume 6, under 12th November). When \[Pope\] John X sent an army into Apulia against the Saracens, the Apostles St Peter and St Paul were seen during the battle, procuring a very great victory for the Christians, (see Liutprand on those very recent events, Book 2, chapter 14). St Theodore the Martyr, by command of the Blessed Virgin, was seen by many and brought help to Emperor John Zimisca while he was fighting the Russians, (Zonaras, Volume 3.) In the same century there took place the well-known dreadful tragedy of Udo, Bishop of Magdeburg, which I shall tell you about later. But please, Reader, bear in mind that \[the tragedy\] would have been happening at this time.
[Page 164]

\[Tenth century\]

In the tenth century lived Euthymius, a Greek, and Hugo Eterianus, a Latin, both of whom thought that the spirits of the dead sometimes appear to the living and are seen by them, (Euthymius on John, chapter 14; Hugo Eterianus, The Return of Souls, chapters 7, 11, 14, 15, and 16). In the year 914, Fernán González, Count of Castile, an illustrious proof of both good and bad fortune, a man noble in both word and deed, relying upon God\'s counsel overthrew Al-Mansur\'s enormous force with only three hundred men. Sixteen years later he also fought an unbelievable number of Arabs for three continuous days with one thousand five hundred infantry and four hundred and fifty cavalry beneath his standards, and on the final day St James was seen to be with them in the fighting. Innumerable men were slaughtered, but \[González\] was triumphant, (\[Jan\] Waes, General History, and other authors.)

The Eleventh Century followed the year 1000

In this century there was holy war under the leadership of Godfrey of Bouillon. During the expedition to Antioch our men almost died of famine and nearly ran out of horses but were strengthened by a vision and the admonitions of St Andrew who also showed them the Lord\'s holy lance. They obtained more than one victory and during the battle with Kerbogha, too, lines of white horses appeared, which put the Persians to flight, (William of Tyre, who took part in the holy war, Sacred Histories Book 6, chapters 4 and 9).

During this same war, when the Christians captured the holy city, Bishop Adhemar, who had died long before, was seen leading the soldiers, scaling the walls, and encouraging his men to follow, (Johannes Naucler, Volume 3, generation 37). Shortly before that, Christ our Lord, together with the Blessed Virgin, St Peter, St John, St Stephen, St Martin, and many other angels besides, showed Himself to the Emperor Henry II at night while the Emperor was keeping vigil in a church in Rome, (Naucler, generation 34). At that time one of St Dunstan\'s dead friends appeared to the saint and predicted that many things were going to happen, which did indeed take place, (Osbert in The Life of St Dunstan in Sauer, under 19th May.) St Odilo, Abbot of Cluny, was seen by friends more than once after his death, (Peter Damian in his life of Odilo in Sauer, under the month of January.)

Peter Damian, a very learned and most eloquent man, flourished at this time and lived into the next century. He changed his life of a cardinal for that of a solitary. His works-and there are many of them-are filled with various kinds of apparition, such as those of the two noble Faventi who appeared out of Hell, (second letter to Hildebrand): or the souls which appeared in the form of small birds, (Letters 5, chapter 3): or the soul of Benedict VIII who appeared, sitting on a black horse, to the Bishop of Capua. Not only Damian (chapter 4), but also Martin of Poland, St Antoninus, and \[Bartolommeo\] Platina recorded an apparition of Benedict IX, and Damian (chapter 11) one of St Andrew and St Gregory flogging an apostate monk. He also has other examples which it would take a long time to mention.

If you look at this sequence of time, one would have to include here what I said about Pandulf of Capua, (which Leo of Ostia confirms, \[Chronicle of Monte Cassino Book 2, chapters 62 and 82). It is worth noting the story of the foundation of the Carthusians. The occasion is well known and in the public domain. On the first, second, and third day during vigils for the dead. An apparition \[was seen\] while they were singing the verse \'Reply to me\' \[Job 13.22\]. The dead man raised his head three times and called out that, by God\'s righteous decision, he had been accused, he had been judged, and he had been sentenced. (Francesco de Puteo tells the story in his life of Bruno in Sauer, Volume 5, under 6th October). In this century lived Bishop St Hanno of Köln and Bishop St Benno of Meissen. St Hanno\'s predecessors as bishop appeared to him, pointed out a stain on his garment, and in this notable fashion impressed on him that he should entirely get rid of his bitterness of mind towards those who had unjustly done him wrong, and forget about it. Of St Benno it is recorded that after his death he appeared in sleep to the Margrave of Meissen and dug out one of his eyes because he had inflicted damage on the Church. (Lambert Schnaffnab tells the story about Hanno in his History of Germany, and Jerome Emser that about Benno in his biography of him, chapter 32, in Sauer, under July).
[Page 165]

\[Twelfth century\]

The twelfth century does not lack its visions of the dead. Notice if you will that in 1112 or rather 1139 Alfonso, King of Portugal, was about to join battle with five Saracen kings when he was encouraged, during his sleep, by Christ to be of good heart and to use a standard on which was embroidered an image of the Five Wounds during the battle. He gained a memorable victory, and this was the origin of the royal arms of Portugal. Fourteen years later Alfonso, King of Castile, was besieging Baéza. St Isidore appeared to him and encouraged him to join battle, and there has scarcely been a more famous victory than this. (\[Juan de\] Mariana, \[Inquiry into the Affairs of Spain\] Book 10, chapter 15, \[Jan\] Waes, \[Esteban de Garibay y\] Zamalloa, and others).

In the year 1117, along with a very large number of other extraordinary events which were agitating Italy, \'In Cremona a tiny child was lying in its cradle, wrapped up in its bed-clothes. Contrary to what happens naturally, it opened its mouth and began to speak, interrupting its mother while she was seeing to his elder brother\'s physical needs and preparing food for him because he had been crying and asking for something to eat. \[The child\] told her he had seen Mary, the Mother of God, standing in front of Christ\'s judgement-seat, supplicating Him with her most earnest prayers because of the judgement which He had laid upon the world because of its sins. After this, \[the child\] did not speak again until it was the appropriate time in the course of human nature for it to do so\'. (See \[Abbot\] Dodechin, \[floruit mid thirteenth century\]. \[Continuation of History \[of Marianus Scotus\].)

An apparition of Pope Benedict X appeared first of all to João \[Peculiar\], Bishop of Porto, in which \[the Pope\] confessed he had been saved from the danger of everlasting death by the prayers of Abbot Odilo. He then appeared to Edelbert and also confessed he had been set free from the pains of Purgatory. (Peter Damian tells the story in his life of Odilo in Sauer, under ist January.) St Norbert, too, appeared after his death to his household. (The story is told in chapter 42 of his biography.) One night, St Bernard saw his uncle Gualdric who had died several days earlier.

\'How are you?\' he asked. \'I\'m fine\', replied his uncle. Then Bernard asked what was the reason he was bellowing in agony \[just before he died\], and why his body was being wracked in a dreadful manner. \'At that very moment\', said Gualdric, \'two vile spirits \[spiritus\] were doing their best to hurl me into a very deep pit, but St Peter came to my aid and I escaped\'.

(See the author of the Life of St Bernard Book 1, chapter 10). Rupert of Deutz and Honoré d\'Autun have the same opinion \[about apparitions\]. Rupert tells us that the Blessed Virgin made herself visible to him and urged him to write, (Rupert in the prologue to his Commentary on the Song of Songs), and in chapter 1 of his Sign of Mary, Honoré mentions Mary of Egypt to whom the Mother of God appeared and drew to repentance, and Theophilus whom she snatched from slavery to the Devil, and the children of Israel whom she protected in the furnace. (Likewise, Peter of Cluny in his book on miracles.) St Martin, a priest and canon regular, lived at this time in León where he wrote various books. He was suddenly transformed from an uneducated man with no Latin to a very good scholar by St Isidore, in whose monastery he was living. \[St Isidore\] appeared to him while he was asleep and offered him a book which he read through eagerly from beginning to end, as Juan de Mariana testifies in his Inquiry into the Affairs of Spain Book 2, chapter 16. \[St Martin\'s\] books are kept there in the large monastery. Those who have seen them say they deal with the prophets, and that some are on Daniel and the Apocalypse. When I was in León there were not many books to be seen, \[but\] one can see and kiss St \[Martin\'s\] hand which remains intact with its skin and nails, although it has dried up and shrunk and is very small.
[Page 166]

\[Thirteenth Century\]

The thirteenth century follows after the year 1200. \[Juan de Mariana, (Book 12, chapter 15), \[Esteban de Garibay y\] Zamalloa, and other writers on the annals of the history of Spain tell us that St James appeared to Alfonso, King of León, at Mérida, and that St Isidore appeared to others at Zamora at the same time and brought them help while they were fighting. Vincent de Beauvais, the author of The Mirror of History, and the German Cistercian, Caesarius of Heisterbach, author of a very large book of miracles or exemplary stories, both lived in this century, and both recorded the appearances of spirits \[spirituum\]. There is no time to copy down any of them here because the subject is too big, and I say the same when it comes to Hélinand de Froidmont\'s Chronicle, Thomas of Cantimpré\'s book \[entitled\] The Bees, and the Life of St Lutgard Book 2. They also lived in this century and compiled a very large number of examples which were very well known to them. St Thomas Aquinas lived at this time. His opinion on the subject is clear, (\[Summa Theologiae\] part 3, question 69, article 2), where he examines the subject and stands on my side \[of the argument\]. So did Guillaume d\'Auvergne in the whole of the last part of his book, The World; and for the purpose of this discussion, one should refer to the example of the apparition of St Ursula and St Gereon who defended Köln along with their companions. (See \[Tilmann\] Bredenbach, Book 4, chapter 22).

\[Fourteenth Century\]

More or less in the following century, the fourteenth, came other theologians with a great reputation, all of whom agree with me-such as Richard of Middleton, in IV, distinction 45, question 3; Petrus de Palude there, the same question 3; and \[Duns\] Scotus, question 1, article 4.

Fifteenth century

Antoninus, Archbishop of Florence confirms this and supplies many examples throughout his History, and so does \[Jean\] Gerson, passim, in his works; Jacobus Chusanus in the book he wrote on this subject; Denis Ryckel, the Carthusian, in Commentary on Book IV \[of the Sentences of Peter Lombard\], distinction 45, question 1, and his work on the four last things, and his book on the novices of his order, where you also find many apparitions; and Alonso Tostado in \[his commentary\] on the First Book of Kings.

\[Sixteenth century\]

In our century, 23rd January 1534, in answer to the Orléans case about which it had been consulted, the Theological Faculty of Paris said, \'It is perfectly clear that, by divine providence and with God\'s permission, the souls of the dead do sometimes return to the living.\' You can find this written answer in Volume 2 of the various legal consults published in Frankfurt and, (to omit any others), \[the following\] openly defend it: Domingo de Soto in his Commentary on Book IV of the Sentences \[of Peter Lombard\] 45, question 1, article 4; \[Theodore\] van Pelt, Purgatory, chapter 5; Peter Canisius, The Incomparable Virgin Mary Book 5, chapters 20 and 21; \[Juan\] Maldonado, chapter 14; Juan Gregorio de Valencia in Part 3, distinction 6, question 11, point 1, and disputation 11, question 1, part 1; \[Roberto\] Bellarmino, Arguments About Purgatory Book 2, chapter 8; José Anglés, A Discussion of Free Will Book 4, art. 1 at the end; Petrus Thyraeus, published treatise on this subject, especially chapter 11; Marko Marulić, The Institution of the Monastic Life Book 6, chapter 14 where, for example, there are a good many examples; and Alfonso Mendoza in Scholastic Disputations, question 5.

A number of historians have also supported this \[opinion\]: \[Battista\] Fregoso, \[Marcantonio\] Sabellico \[Cocci\], and Ignatius in a very large number of passages in their books by way of example; Paolo Giovio, Life of Azzone Visconti and History \[of His Own Times\] Book 30; Carlo Sigonio on the Empire in the West, Books 3 and 10 of The Kingdom of Italy Book 1; Albert Kranz, Saxony Book 7, chapters 16 and 14, and Metropolis Book 9, chapter 13; Francisco \[López\] de Gómara, History of Mexico, chapters 20 and 104; Jerónimo Osório, The Deeds of Manuel, \[King of Portugal\]; \[Giovanni\] Pietro Maffei, History of India; and Tommaso Bozio, Signs of the Church, passim; and to close this list I have put in last place a very bright torch of the history of the Church and a most doughty fighter against the assaults of the innovators, the unconquered footsoldier Cesare Baronio, whose individual volumes of The Annals of the Church, of which he has already published seven volumes, to the benefit of the public, are like seven golden cups of the Catholic candelabrum.
[Page 167]

I shall add at least some of the more notable examples from these last centuries, because my opponents make little of more recent \[examples\]. First, therefore-and I cannot be sure of the century-I shall relate here what Glykas \[says\] in part 4 of his Annals. \'In the history of the Church by the historian Philo, one finds that at a particular moment during the ancient persecutions, a bishop banned a rather elderly ecclesiastic from \[holding\] church services. But when that elderly man went elsewhere to do something he had to do, it happened he was seized by natives and gave witness in his own person to the truth. In consequence, a church was founded on the spot and the ceremonies of consecration carried out. When the Bishop started to pronounce the words, \"Peace be to everyone\", the bier went out the church, and this happened not once, but two or three times. From there the elderly man addressed the Bishop from the sleep \[of death\]. \"I\'m going\", he said, \"but please intercede for me with my bishop \[and ask\] him to come here and release me from my bonds, because he excluded me from my sacred office and so I can\'t be present with you at religious services. I have obtained the crown of my witnessing, but I have not yet seen God\'s face. But if \[the Bishop\] comes here and does not release me, no one else will be able to do so\". Accordingly, when \[his Bishop\] complied with these \[requests\], the bier ceased leaving the church.\'

This is an appropriate place to record the revenge taken by divine providence upon a wicked bishop. It happened during the tenth century but was omitted from my earlier account. \'When Udo, Bishop of Magdeburg, was not moved even by signs and prophetic voices to refrain from lewd behaviour, the clergy asked God either to amend or to remove him. One of their number, Canon Frederik, was praying after this fashion in the Cathedral of St Maurice at night, when he noticed that all the lights in the church were extinguished by a rather strong gust of wind, and not long afterwards that two youths carrying two candelabra with lighted candles came in, followed closely by Christ, His mother, and the Apostles. They summoned the holy people whose bodies were lying at rest in the church, and \[St\] Maurice was seen to come along with them. In a long, serious speech he laid an accusation against Bishop Udo and not long after that Christ ordered the two \[youths\] to fetch him, stripped of his clothes. He passed sentence against him, but the bishop put up a fight and one of the two who were bringing him struck him a violent blow in the midst of his kidneys, \[whereupon\], into a chalice which had been placed on the altar, the Bishop vomited up the Host of Christ which he had taken in communion the previous day. Then Udo was struck down by an axe and the vision and everyone in it vanished. Frederik was therefore absolutely terrified when he went up to the altar, looked in the chalice, \[and saw\] that it contained the Host of Christ and that the Bishop was lying dead on the ground. He woke the other clergy and they removed the Bishop\'s body and buried it in a field\', (\[Battista\] Fregoso, \[Memorable Deeds and Sayings\], Book 9, chapter 12, and Johannes Naucler, \[Chronicles\] Part 2.

\'Two wealthy merchants who came from not undistinguished families were making their way to France via the Mont Genèvre Pass when they met a man of larger than human appearance and received an instruction from him which went as follows. \"Speak to my brother Lodovico Sforza and give him this letter on my behalf\". They were rendered speechless and wondered who he was. He told them he was Galeazzo Sforza, and not long afterwards vanished from their eyes. They hastily returned to Milan and from there went to Vigevano where \[Ludovico\] \'The Moor\' was staying and delivered the Duke\'s letter whose contents were as follows.
[Page 168]

\"Oh, oh, oh, Ludovico! Watch out! The Venetians and the French are about to come and destroy you and overthrow your House, but if you give me three thousand gold pieces, I shall help you to mollify the spirits \[spiritibus\] and get them to avert your hapless fate: and I promise this will be the result, provided you agree and don\'t oppose me. Goodbye\", signed, \"The spirit of your brother, Galeazzo\".

Some people may laugh at this as an invention, but not long afterwards the prince was ejected from his principality by Louis XII, King of France, and taken into captivity\', (Bernardino Arluno, an eye-witness, History of Milan, section 1.)

\'Not long after he died,\' (says \[Marc Antonio\] Sabellico), \'Lodovico\'s father, the lord of Imola, appeared to a secretary who was being sent to Ferrara by his son, Lodovico. \[He appeared\] while the man was on his way and told him to tell his son to meet him there the next day because he had something of great importance to say to him. When Lodovico heard this, he sent someone else in his place because he did not believe it and because he was afraid it was a trap. The same ghost \[umbra\] who had appeared before met the man and was deeply pained that his son had not come, because he said he had a good many things to tell him. On this occasion, however, he wanted to say just this-that after twenty-two years and one month had passed, (and he added a specific day), Lodovico would lose the control of the city which he now enjoyed; and when the time predicted by the ghost arrived, even though great care had been taken on the very night his father\'s spirit \[manes\] had cast suspicion, the confederate army of Duke Filippo of Milan got as far as the walls, since most of the ditches were frozen solid, set up ladders, and captured the city along with its prince,\' (Sabellico, Exemplary Stories Book 1, chapter 4.)

In Book 1 of his History \[of Italy\], Francesco Guicciardini says that a rumour spread around that the spirit of Ferdinand, King of Naples, appeared on three different nights to Jacopo, a surgeon \[in the household\] of his son King Alfonso, and ordered him, in mild and gentle language at first, but later with threats and reproaches, to tell Alfonso, in the words he was actually using, that there was no reason for him to flatter himself with the worthless hope that he could keep French power in check, because it had been decided and determined by the law of Fate that the House of Aragon was to be shaken by an endless number of misfortunes and, in the end, deprived of its kingdom.

Guicciardini, however, does add, \'One is, however, at liberty not to disparage such things entirely\', and he added it, not in relation to the apparition, but to the trustworthiness of the prediction. He was quite right to do so, because we see it was not true. Count Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola writes in his biography of his uncle, Giovanni Pico, that not long after his death, Giovanni\'s ghost \[spectrum\] appeared to Girolamo Savonarola and told him he was being tortured by the pains of atonement because he had not multiplied, with sufficient diligence and fertile results, the talent of learning and cleverness God had credited to him, and because he had not made a proper return on God\'s inward suggestions and inspirations which kept urging him not to break off the honourable labours he had begun and which he had told himself mentally to undertake in earnest and bring to a conclusion. Not long afterwards, Girolamo told people about this in one of his public addresses and commended Pico to everyone\'s prayers.

Cesare Baronio testifies of the elder Michele Mercati that Michele and Marsilio \[Ficino\] were very close friends because they were deeply interested in the same things and were closely bound together by \[their belonging to\] the School of Plato. One day, however, it happened \'that as usual \[they were discussing\] Plato\'s opinion on which part of a human being survives after death and, not without consternation, they came to the conclusion that \[his arguments\] were unstable and needed to be propped up by the mysteries of the Christian faith. (A learned letter from Marsilio to Michele Mercati about the immortality of the spirit and God, \[with a reference\] to this deduction still exists).
[Page 169]

But when they had argued their differences for quite a long time, they brought their discussion to an end and closed it by agreeing to make a pact that whichever one of them should die first would, if he were permitted, tell the other about his state in the next life. Having made this agreement, they both swore their oath and then went their separate ways. After only a brief lapse of time it happened that Michele the elder was engaged in philosophical studies in the middle of the morning when he suddenly began to hear the racket made by a horse galloping at speed. It stopped at his door and Marsilio\'s voice cried out, \"Michele, Michele, it\'s true, it\'s true!\" Surprised by his friend Marsilio\'s voive, Michele got up, opened the window, and saw the man he had heard riding away again, mounted on a white horse. He shouted after the white figure, calling him by name, \"Marsilio, Marsilio!\" and pursuing him with his eyes. But he vanished from them. Astounded by this strange event and feeling anxious about Marsilio, Michele went and made careful inquiries-Marsilio was living in Florence at the time of his death-and found out that Marsilio had died at the very time he had heard and seen him\', (Baronio, Annals \[of the Church\], Vol. 5, under the year \'412\'.)

I shall pass over what \[Tilmann\] Bredenbach says in his Collection \[of Holy Stories\] Book 7, chapters 11 and 46 and Book 8, chapters 12, 14, 23, and 40. \[But\] I do include one \[example of an apparition\] which one can rely on because of the evidence of many perfectly serious soldiers who solemnly swore they had seen it. Some years ago, when Alessandro Farnese was conducting his remarkable siege of Antwerp, in order to help the besieged the Dutch and English made a sally, and so did the besieged at the same time with a view to keeping the enemy occupied. They fought very fiercely, seized, and took possession of the royal army\'s earthwork, and appeared to be free from danger. At that moment, the more distinguished of the King\'s soldiers started to see Pedro de Paz near the earth-work-a Spanish commander and a man very much praised for his military qualities and the attention to duty which marked him out. He had died a few months earlier and on this occasion was seen fully armed as he used to be when leading his regiment. He signalled to his former soldiers and gave them the order to follow him. The front rank pointed him out to the second, the second to the third, and the third to those behind them. They all saw the same thing and, full of astonishment, plucked up their spirits and followed the leader they knew so well. He went in front of them and led them straight towards the enemy, and the fighting started. The Dutch, however, were driven back to their ships, leaving the earthwork to the King\'s troops, and at that moment the town, which was very well fortified, lost its hope of victory and of defending itself.

A quite dreadful thing to read is something which happened in Pavia earlier this year (1601) in April, in the diocese of a small town called Corretto. A notary\'s funeral was taking place in the church, when suddenly the corpse raised himself from his bier, turned to one of his relatives who was attending the funeral, and told him to hurry to his house, and to take a number of \[hand-\]written documents which were there and put them straight back in a holy place. Because he had concealed them, the dead man \[said\], God had justly sentenced him to the torments of Hell, having said which, he laid his head down as before. God permitted this so that mortals might realise what serious penalties await treacherous clerks of this kind who embezzle the legacies of people who are devout. I shall also write down a second anecdote, one worthier of being remembered, about an apparition \[spectri\]-I do not know whether it was of an evil spirit or a damned soul-which I did not recall I had read. I hope the pleasure and use \[the reader will gain\] from reading it will overcome its length. It has been taken from a letter from Peru, dated 1590, and is told in the actual words either of Francesco Benci or Gaspar Spitilli.
[Page 170]

\'An extraordinary thing, well worthy thinking about, happened to this same Fr Samaniego during the mission\', (the one to Itata), \'and the inhabitants of the city where it took place have known nothing like the one which has happened to him. It is confirmed by so many testimonies, too, that there is no room left for doubt. It was experienced by people who saw it with their own eyes and heard it. This event, unfortunate in its outcome, was allowed \[to happen\] -and one can believe this about similar things which people have confessed have happenedso that a population newly converted could learn that the sacrament of penance, in which one finds it difficult \[to confess\] sins which are not inconsiderable, must be treated with good faith and integrity. Consequently, the Indian woman who, everyone could see, was violating the strict rule that confession must be complete, was punished and chastised in sight of everyone, so that the salvation of many souls could be procured by the downfall of one. What happened was this.

In the house of a distinguished lady of this locality lived a young girl aged about sixteen, who had been captured during war and baptised. She was called Katarina. As she grew older, so did her lack of self-restraint and dissolute behaviour, even though she was not infrequently rebuked and punished by her mistress. The girl came to such a pitch of wickedness that she began secretly to frequent \[the company of certain profligate individuals. Yet she did not fail to go to confession, although she kept her mouth shut about this sin in case people would think she was a little tart, or someone whose morals were past recovery. On 1st August 1590 she fell ill and sent for a priest, to whom she laid bare her soul\'s offences. She did not do so entirely, however. The priest came and went nine times during her illness, but she would laugh scornfully \[and say\] something like this to the other servants who were there. \"That other sort of thing I was doing-it wasn\'t what I\'d confess as one of my sins\", and she used such shameful, disgraceful language as she said it that all the other servants were offended and reported it, word for word, to their mistress. She quite rightly shouted at Katarina, but then changed her expression and tone and asked in a friendly way what were those \[sins\] she was unwilling to confess to the Father. Katarina had no problem in telling her, and said that every time she sent for the Father during her illness so that she could cleanse herself in confession, someone looking like an Aethiopian stood on her left and kept telling her not to confess because those \[particular\] sins were very slight and of no importance, and if she confessed them the Father would be able to think she was more dissolute \[than she was\]. But on her right St Mary Magdalene appeared and urged her to purge herself frankly of whatever it was.

The Father came again, and the lady acquainted him with everything that had happened, and he tried in every possible way to get her to make a full atonement for \[the benefit of her soul. He did so, however, in vain. The more he exhorted, the more stubborn she became-to the extent that she was unwilling to pronounce the word \"Jesus\". On another occasion, too, they offered her a holy picture of the crucifixion so that she could contemplate it and reflect that Christ was nailed to the cross and died on the cross for us. But with the greatest disdain and emotional agitation she replied, \"I already know that. What do you want me to do about it?\" Her mistress said to her, \"We want you to turn to Christ so that if you acknowledge \[the sins you have committed, He can forgive them\". Katarina answered, \"Please stop bothering me\", and when her mistress had gone away, she started to talk in a sing-song voice about her loves and her shameful behaviour. She kept this up for several days, \[talking about\] the things she did and said, until one night her mistress came along with \[some of the female servants, and Katarina burst out, \"I\'m on the rack and in agony because I have profaned confession; and from that very moment until midnight her whole body became stiff.
[Page 171]

They thought she had died and began to think about digging her grave and giving her a funeral. But she came to, and the priest was sent for. She, however, made no change at all from the way she had usually spoken before. Three hours later, not long before she died, the servants urged her to take a cross and a holy candle in her hand and invoke the name of Jesus. But she replied, \"Who is that Jesus? I don\'t know the name of Jesus\", and she turned back to the end of the bed, sat on it, and was heard having a conversation with someone they could not see. Another female servant who was lying sick in the same room earnestly begged her mistress to have her moved to another bedroom because, she said, she could see a number of black hobgoblins \[larvas\] and she was absolutely terrified of them. On the night Katarina died, the whole house was pervaded by such a foetid stench of corruption that the corpse had to be put in a place open to the air.

The lady\'s brother was dragged out of bed by his arm; a female servant was hit on the shoulder by a small stone and carried the marks of her injury for several days; stones rained against a wall, and a horse which in other respects was perfectly tame ran hither and thither and went mad all night long; and dogs did the same, running about and barking. After the body had been buried, one of the female servants went into the room in which Katarina had lain ill, and even though she saw no one, she had the experience of having a dish, which had been put on the wooden floor, being thrown at her. The greater part of the town saw a very large number of slates and roof-tiles hurled about, with a great deal of crashing and noise, up to a distance of two miles-although there is not any slate or roof-tile on the big house because, for the most part, all this city\'s buildings are roofed with palm leaf. Another female slave was dragged by the foot a very long way while many people looked on, and yet they could not see who was dragging her.

On 7th October, when a female servant went into the wardrobe to fetch a dress for herself, she saw Katarina slowly rising to her feet to seize hold of a plate, and when she ran away, Katarina threw the plate at the wall so violently that it broke into a thousand pieces. Next day a paper crucifix was pinned to the wardrobe, but it was torn down from the wall in front of everyone\'s eyes and ripped into three pieces. On the same day, while the lady was having her dinner in the garden, a slate was thrown into the middle of her plate, all the food fell on the ground, and her four-year old son started shouting, \"Mummy, Mummy! Katarina\'s strangling me!\" They hung holy relics round his neck and he was free from that torment. These \[events\] forced the lady to change house, and she took herself off to her cousin\'s house, leaving her own house in the charge of some of her female servants. On the tenth of that month, one of the servants went into the housekeeper\'s room and felt herself being called three times by Katarina.

She went to pieces in an excess of fear, and the rest of the female staff urged her to call upon our Lord for help and to go back into the room with a lighted holy candle. She chose two of the women who seemed to be bolder than the rest and went back, feeling secure. But the dead woman told her to send the other women away, get rid of the candle, because it was causing her pain, and stay there alone. Katarina then started to discharge flames, along with an unbelievable stench, from every joint in her body. She was burning from head to foot and had a band of fire, as it were, round her, eight or ten fingers wide, which extended right down to the ground. At the sight of this apparition, the servant began to tremble and turn white, and the unfortunate dead woman said to her, \"Come here! How many times have I summoned you!\" Almost half-dead \[with fear\], the servant replied, \"Holy Jesus, who would not be terrified at the sight of you?\" The moment she said this, there came down into that place a very beautiful child, dressed in white, who urged the servingwoman to lay aside her fear, take courage, and note carefully what Katarina was \[going to\] say to her, so that she could tell other people and atone for all her sins by \[going to\] confession as soon as she left that place.
[Page 172]

Then Katarina spoke as follows. \"Please be aware that I have been delivered up to Hell and subjected to the heaviest of punishments because when I went to the priest to confess my sins, I told him only those which were not very serious-that I was a chatter-box and talkative, prone to anger, and other things of that kindbut I said absolutely nothing about my wanton behaviour and my habitual sex with young men. Learn, then, to make a good confession and not keep silent about anything you have done wrong. I am impressing this on you because I have been commanded to do so, and I am forced to be frank about this as an example to others.\"

Then they heard the bell ringing for the Angelus and the dead woman quickly drew back into a corner \[of the room\] and vanished. But the angel-because the serving-woman was convinced the child she had seen was an angel-told her to go away home, and that is what she did.\'

I decided to leave this well-attested anecdote till last because of kinds of apparition come into it: angels, St Mary Magdalene, an evil spirit looking like an \'Aithiopian\', and a damned soul in an assumed body-not, I think, its own, but one made of air in the likeness of its own body. Atheists usually make fun of the pains of Hell and the immortality of the soul, unless they are willing to come to their senses. Calvinists do the same in the case of blessed candles, the relics of the saints, and the soundness of and necessity for auricular confession. What are they going to say? \'It\'s all made up by the Jesuits!\' Who can say it has all been made up if everyone these days can disprove that \[by referring\] to the passages I have quoted? Let them go and listen and see. Are they going to say these are the inventions of silly women? \'I believe that the slates and roof-tiles which were removed and scattered in places far away\', (which the whole population saw), \'are the results of women\'s imagination\'. Men dragged out of bed, a woman struck by a piece of earth and dragged along the ground while others are looking? \'Dreams!\' The plates dashed against the wall and broken into innumerable pieces? \"They were dreams!\' Older people could be malicious enough to make these things up and spread them, but an innocent four-year old child? That is not an age capable of evil intent so that \[a child\], in the presence of relics. Lies that he is being strangled by a dead woman he scarcely knew, or feigns fear when relics are hung round his neck. I\'m afraid Katarina\'s death is a threat to those who praise and imitate her offence and either turn the holy mysteries of confession into a theatrical hypocrisy or think the penalties of Hell are no more than fairy tales!

You have a cloud of witnesses, a veritable hailstorm of examples with which the wild vines and nettles of the innovators have been ripped \[out of the ground\] by their roots, torn to shreds, and trodden underfoot. I make this one suggestion. Think carefully whether it is more reasonable and safer to believe the Fathers of the First and Second Council of Nicaea, the Greek and Latin Doctors of the Church and six hundred other very weighty theologians and historians of proven credibility, or a number of insolent individuals of the last century-and very few of them at that!-from the stage-play of a de-cowled Saxon and a branded criminal from Noyon. These people say that the dead cannot appear to the living at a particular time. They deny that God ever permits it, and they contradict both \[propositions\], as I have told you, either in explicit terms or by producing examples they would never have quoted had they believed them to be true. Here you clearly have the Scaurian judgement. You are not unaware of the splendid, high-minded thing Scaurus said. You read it in Book 3 of Valerius Maximus. \'Varius \[Severus\] of Sucro says that Aemilius Scaurus has been corrupted by a royal bribe and had betrayed Roman imperial rule. Aemilius Scaurus\', (he was the Leader of the Senate), \'denies that this crime has anything to do with him. Which man are you going to believe?
[Page 173]

I am now going to make a similar argument. The buffoons of our time, the satirical Momuses and plagues of the Church, deny the apparitions of spirits \[spirituum\] and mock them. The saints, the doctrinally correct Fathers \[of the Church\], and the world\'s learned Asian, Africans, and Europeans acknowledge some \[apparitions\] and hold them in honour. Which side are you going to believe? The centuriators of Magdeburg and the croaking frogs who live in Lake Geneva maintain there have never been any genuine sightings of the dead. The captains and heralds of the Gospel, who sucked their knowledge of eternal wisdom from the teats of the Church Militant, which is the pillar of truth, include a very large number in what they write and unanimously agree that they are genuine. Which side are you going to believe? We have apparitions of saints, we have apparitions of the damned, we have apparitions of the blessed, certified by documents from the Church\'s history, by the teaching of \[Church\] Fathers, by acts of the Councils \[of the Church\], and by the records of divine Scripture. Isn\'t it ill-advised to fight against these, shameful to resist them, and irreligious and blasphemous to disparage the good faith of all of them? To accuse these and their authors of lying or stupidity? I am at a loss to know what to call \[such people\]. Understand thoroughly how vile this situation is, Reader, and when you have understood it, cast the thought from you: and when you have cast it from you, crush it underfoot and curse it. To accuse them of lying-unless perhaps they are pretending that one should swallow untruths for truths? To ascribe stupidity to them, if they are not pretending that so many very weighty, very wise, very holy men were stupid enough to allow themselves to be deluded by these inane nursery songs, and to accept old women\'s tales as historical fact? This is the becoming conduct of one\'s opponents.

Book 2, Question 26, Section 6

But perhaps they are impelled to believe this by some rational process of thought or effective argument. I shall set out their objections honestly so that you may examine them. It is for you to judge and determine. \'In Italy\', says Philipp Melanchthon on Manilius\'s Calendar, \'they have the most filthy and obscene fairy tales about Mary who appeared to some monks\'-a fine saying, and one worthy of a buffoon entirely given to lying. Asia has apparitions of the most holy Mother of God. So does Africa, so does Spain, and so does Germany, as I have said, not just Italy, and these are as far removed from all obscenity and filthiness as Melanchthon himself is from purity of faith and Luther from chastity and holiness of life and morals. These cannot be called fairy tales, either. In every age the most weighty writers and most holy men have ratified them by their public testimonies, and the traditions of the Church have confirmed them.

But Melanchthon and Johannes Rivius have felt honour bound to consider that apparitions of the saints, which have been proven by so many centuries, are pieces of old women\'s nonsense; and even though they themselves might be very silly people, they keep calling Pope St Gregory silly, and add falsehood to impudence by childishly, without discernment, and deceitfully, without integrity, heaping up a large number of untruths and inanities, and taking the private abuses of some individuals and the laughable conjectures of fools, and twisting them into public contumely of Catholics, as though \[belief in the appearance of spirits\] did not arise from things which are perfectly good and true. In consequence, \[apparitions\] are explained as subject to deceit and the tricks and malice of human beings and evil spirits and tend to the destruction of those who misuse them. What is more useful than bread? But an abundance of it did harm to Sodom. What is healthier than wine? But drunkenness has killed several people as though it were a sword. What is better than the worship of God? But how many have turned it into the veneration of idols? We need discrimination and common sense, therefore, in order to separate true from false. It is not permissible, however, to disparage faith in things which are true on behalf of things which are false.
[Page 174]

Johann Marbach denies that any \[apparitions\] are genuine unless they turn out to be of Christ and of angels. Why, then, have the Fathers \[of the Church\] and historians been in the habit of adding this so carefully when \[the apparitions\] have been occasioned by angels? Why does the new Vigilantius chain the saints up? Why does he bind them with shackles and manacles? Why does he lock them up in this prison, a man entirely worthy of being imprisoned himself because of his manifold blasphemies, who should be put in shackles because of his desertion to the enemy, a four-footed creature who should be chained up because of his madness and raving?

The centuriators and Lavater add arguments little different \[from his\], by which they try to prove that Purgatory does not exist-I pass over these here because they are irrelevantbut I shall make certain replies which are adapted to the \[present\] discussion. \'What answer\', they say, \'can you give to Augustine who quite clearly denies that the souls of the dead have any interest in what the living are doing, even though, (said Augustine), his mother would be a very welcome sight to him on any night?\' (See The Care of the Dead as cited earlier). \'What answer,\' (they say), \'can you give to Athanasius, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Tertullian who thought these were the deceptions of evil spirits who need our prayers and pretend they have come from Purgatory by a difficult far-off path?\' They add \[passages\] from Scripture. \'Someone who has gone down into Hell does not come up again any more,\' (Job); and the Psalmist, \'A human is a spirit which goes and does not return. He is dust, and after he has bloomed once, it is said he no longer recognises his place\'. In what way can he return? Elsewhere we are told, \'Everyone dies, and like water slips away\'. Who will call back to its source \[water\] which has slipped away? St Peter and St Paul say the dead are sleeping. Why should you wake them before the end \[of the world\]? Abraham says that the dead cannot cross the chaos which lies between him and them, so that means they cannot be sent to tell the living what is happening where they are. If they cannot come by their own power or because they are sent by God, in what way will they appear to mortals?

This is a summary of those of their arguments which have any importance. But actually it is an abuse of the Scriptures and misrepresents what the Fathers \[of the Church\] say. In Luke, the patriarch Abraham does not deny that the dead can be or are habitually sent by God. He was denying that God was sending them at that particular time, and his word \'chaos\' signifies that enormous, uncrossable gap which none of the dead can cross without God\'s permission, because it has been constituted by God\'s immutable law that souls cannot leave their places of refuge without His permission.

God\'s law has also established it as inviolable that the blessed have no pity for the damned-St Gregory said the road back here is impassable-and that there is no change of destiny or any community of merits between them. (Ambrose and others have replied to this, on which see St Thomas Aquinas, The Golden Chain). The princes of the Apostles testify that the dead are sleeping. This I acknowledge, but the word \'sleep\' signifies \'death\' and \'to sleep\' is \'to be dead\'. This sense comes from the Greeks and is why they call cemeteries коциптуріа, that is, \'dormitories\'. Homer, too, when talking about Mercury\'s wand with which they used to think he roused the dead, said Úπvwvtas Éyeípei, \'he wakes up those who are asleep\', i.e. the dead. (Vergil renders this more obscurely and less accurately as \'he unseals the eyes in death\'.) The Jews also use the word \'to sleep\' for \'to die\', and the Syrians call the dead \'those who are sleeping\', because they hope to be resurrected. As Angelo Canini has observed, if \"to sleep\" means, as far as Lavater is concerned, that \[the dead\] are never seen by anyone, where is faith in the resurrection? Moses, Samuel, Jeremiah, and Onias were \'sleeping\', yet they appeared.
[Page 175]

But \'we all slip away like water. We are dust,\' and we are dispersed into the air. Well now, Reader, whoever you may be who leans for support on these pillars, I\'m telling you, I\'m giving you a good shake-beware of using arguments of this kind, because if they prove anything, they prove that there will never even be a resurrection. \'Once water has slipped away, it never returns\'. Look at rivers! Surely we are not \'never\' going to return? One should therefore say, rather, that in these and similar passages Holy Scripture simply intends to indicate to us how weak and fleeting our life is, as St Augustine and Angelomus \[of Luxeuil\] noted. The royal Psalmist says that a dead person does not recognise his place any more. Here notice that not one of the Fathers \[of the Church\], and no one before Luther, explains this passage the way Lavater does, so that you can recognise an innovator as quickly as you can accurately when it comes to such a novel fabrication.

I find that earlier \[commentators\] had four explanations. I omit the two Jewish ones in the Midrash Tehillim: one, because it is irreligious and deduces from this that the soul is mortal, and the second, which has very little to do with the text \[we are discussing\], is about original sin and that does not arise \[when one is talking about\] a person\'s rising from the dead. These interpret \'velo yashub\' \[nor will he return as \'yatsar haras\' \[breaking down something which has been formed\]. Two of the \[Church\] Fathers\' expositions are clearly figurative, such as that by Arnobius who talks about wealth, and another by Basil who talks about repentance and says that once someone has fallen into sin, he cannot, without God\'s grace, rise up again by his own power. The third belongs to those who say that this passage is not to be interpreted as relating to the body, but to the whole sublunary world to which the soul cannot return, once it has left its dwelling place of the body, without God\'s particular permission. (Thus, an anonymous, but very learned interpreter of the psalms). The fourth is that of Apollinaris and Euthymius. Their meaning is that God knows and recognises the state of the human condition. Death hastens after us-we who begin to perish soon after we are born. Our brief light dies as the same time as we do and the flower of life withers. The web of life, once broken, cannot be joined together again. The bond of soul and body, once untied, cannot be tied together again, and once our soul has flown away, like the wind, it cannot recognise its body any more in order to come to it and take possession of it. During the resurrection itself, the blessed will discover that \[the body\] is shining and incorruptible, the damned, that it is foul, frightful, and liable to corruption. But the damned as well as the blessed will realise that it is, by God\'s command, a work worthy of an angel.

Why? Is it because several people realise that in the case of their friends, once the soul has retreated, they do not recognise their body any more, but hate it? These people are interpreting \'its own\' for \'its\', the way Hebrew does. Father Manuel de Sá seems to be of this opinion. Why? Because St Jerome followed Hebrew usage and translated \'it will not recognise its place any more\'. This is how most Jews understand it, and the Chaldee \[Aramaic\] paraphraser and \[François\] Vatable follow suit. St Job had said this earlier in chapter 7, and the Hebrew, Chaldee \[Aramaic\], Greek, and Latin \[versions\] agree exactly with this interpretation-that memory of the dead person will die as though he had not existed, and that survivors will never know, unless they are informed through revelation, what happens to the dead, along with their life, or where they are being detained. It is perfectly clear that none of this has any force in the face of generally held opinion. What the royal prophet is told-that a human being is a \'breath of wind going and not returning\'-is less of an obstacle because the words which preceded it, \'because they are flesh\', clearly indicate that they are referring to the corruption and wickedness of human nature, and since this always inclines to what is worse, it cannot come back from evil to good on its own.
[Page 176]

A better interpretation is that they are referring to the human being who is liable to decay, who hastens towards death at the speed of Pegasus, and who cannot by his own power come back to life from death. St Job\'s words, \'Someone who has gone down to Hell this way will not come up again. He will not return to his own house, nor will his place recognise him any more\'. \[7.9-10\]. These \[words\] clearly mean the same as those of David which I explained a moment ago. Denys \[van Leeuwan\] also explains in fine style that the soul which has gone down to Hell does not return in the ordinary course of Nature to its former way of life, to its riches, its estates, and its palaces, \'although\', (the words are his), \'it may be able to happen miraculously and often does\', and St Thomas \[Aquinas\], older than he, says in relation to the same text that Job was talking about what happens in the natural course of things, not about what is done miraculously.

So, there you have our opponents\' weapons from the quiver of Scripture! Perhaps one will be able to have more confidence in their use of the Fathers \[of the Church\] Perhaps \[they will get\] more support from them? Not less, at any rate. These people\'s whole attestation is undoubtedly a swindle, and if they allowed themselves to be bound by any law, the Lex Rhemnia would not let them escape branding. I am surprised that St Augustine is offered to me as an objector. You have heard his opinion in this Book, and he convicts these stubborn individuals in no uncertain manner. He says, in fact, that for the most part these appearances are those of angels, but he adds that spirits \[spiritus\] are also sometimes sent to us autorpoownws \[in their own person\]. He denies that they can return because they decide to do so without regard to the will of God, even though \[in other respects, he says,\] his mother would always be present to him; but he maintains that sometimes they do come back at God\'s command, and he establishes this with examples.

\[The objectors\] produce Athanasius to fight \[for them\], but he is wearing a mask, because the man they are referring to is Anastasius of Nicaea, not Athanasius. Athanasius\'s authority must be kept separate. The reason for this and I throw back at my opponents with careless ease the kind of things he says in his Question 11, is that, relying on David\'s testimony-and I have already dealt with this at length-he denies that spirits appear and adds these words. \'There can be no doubt in the case of the souls of the saints, because they will recognise everything both after death and on the Day of Judgement.\'⁴ From this we can make the following inferences. If the souls of the blessed recognise everything after they are dead, they therefore also recognise their own place. If \[they recognise\] their own place, they can return to it, with God\'s permission. Therefore \[Anastasius\] has denied that the souls of the damned can return, because they do not recognise their own place, and he has taken David\'s words to refer only to these souls and not to all souls, as Lavater does. His Question 8 does not deprive them completely of any return, (because this contradicts Holy Scripture), but it does deny that they are sent back by God to satisfy human curiosity and tell people what is happening in Hell.

One needs to be aware, too, that a particular heresy was spreading and flourishing in those days: that the souls of the dead, especially of those who had died a violent death, become evil spirits and are then forced by wicked incantations to obey humans and answer their questions. The Fathers \[of the Church\] opposed this madness as forcefully as they could and unremittingly confuted that insane doctrine. Isidore \[does so\] very well in Etymologies Book 2, chapter 8, and so does John Chrysostom of Constantinople in his second homily (on Lazarus), and in his fourth homily (on Luke) where he explains why God does not allow many people to return to life. It is so that evil spirits may be deprived of material for their deceptions.
[Page 177]

When he says \'many\' are not permitted, isn\'t he acknowledging that some are, even if only a few? He also removes their ability to return in order to tell interesting little anecdotes but does not entirely take away their liberty to come back at God\'s command. On the contrary, in his twenty-ninth homily (on Matthew), he clearly says \'they cannot come back of their own accord\'. Why would he add \'of their own accord\' if they could not return in accordance with God\'s will? This is what Theophylact was dealing with in chapter 8 \[of his commentary on\] Matthew, when he testifies that evil spirits wanted to fabricate a doctrine about the wandering of souls in this world, with which, \[he says\], one cannot agree at all because when souls have come out of the body, they already have a place determined for them and do not go wandering about. With these words he denies that spirits \[spiritus\] \'Èv TW koope πhavátas\' \[wander about in the world\]-these are his words-by their own decision, because they are immediately assigned to specific places. He and Chrysostom are opposing the same error, and both agree with me, as I said.

Finally, Septimius Tertullian also rejects that plainly poetic, and perhaps Platonist, pagan fiction about those who have died before their time and tells us that their souls \'do not wander until the rest of their allotted years have been completed, and he rightly rebuts this poetic licence, along with the audacity of magicians and their meaningless \'power\' to draw forth the soul of those lying \[in their graves\]. But he also adds that God\'s power has called back certain souls as proofs of His right to do so. (You can find this written at the very end of his book on the soul). So neither Holy Scripture, nor the Fathers \[of the Church\], nor reason support \[the objectors\]-only foolhardiness, the malignant disease of trying to be novel, and a desire to traduce something which has a long history, and to revile Catholics, support the objectors.

Book 2, Question 26, Section 7

My second conclusion must be that magicians cannot make use of evil spirits to show us the real souls of the dead. This is what Tertullian thinks in the penultimate chapter of his book on the soul, St Isidore in Book 8 of his Etymologies, Chrysostom and Augustine whom he cites and agrees with, St Thomas \[Aquinas\] Part 1, question 117, article 4, objection 2, Guillaume d\'Auvergne in chapter 24 of the last part of his book on the universe, and \[Francisco de\] Vitoria, Magic, number 17; and a recent writer, Alfonso Mendoza, discusses this at length in question 5 of his Scholastic Questions for Discussion.

The reason is that the souls of the saints are in the hand of God and obey God alone. The Devil cannot allow \[the souls\] of the damned to come out \[of Hell\] unless God commands it, and unless He does, the Devil has not the power to do it, since he too has a place in those things for which \[the damned\] are making atonement. So evil spirits take their place, and are still wandering through the world, and love to cheat these souls, as Iamblichus, relying on Porphyry, explained in his book on the mysteries of the Egyptians. One should not find this surprising, since they transform themselves into an angel of light, and into the blessed Virgin Mother of God, as happened in Bordeaux-I know this happened because I was living there at the time⁴⁵²-and indeed into Christ the Lord Himself, which is the form in which the Devil appeared to St Martin.

From these examples it follows: (i) that the ridiculous notion of some people, reported by D\'Anania, that when you stretch out your hand to the dying and the dying stretch out theirs and take it, their souls will appear to you after they have died, is utterly superstitious, and there is no authority either in the written or the unwritten word of God, or the narratives of various histories, which lends support to this idea.
[Page 178]

\(ii\) It follows that one should not heedlessly imitate something which several people once did and something which Johann von Freiburg says, after mature reflection, in his Manual for Confessors, Book 1, title 11, question 23, should not be censured on the ground that it is a sin. He and St Thomas \[Aquinas\] do not deny-and \[Jan de\] Beets follows them-that it is dangerous, that for the most part such people hand themselves over to be made sport of by an evil spirit, and that they have succumbed to the threatening remark that \'He who loves danger will perish in it\', \[Ecclesiasticus 3.27\] Consequently, in Book 3, chapter 11 of his book on superstition, \[Pedro\] Ciruelo sensibly rebukes those who strike a mutual bargain with someone, intending that, (if it is allowed), the one who dies before the other will appear to the one who is still alive and give him information about his condition.

I know that God has sometimes permitted this, as I told you in the case of Marsilio Ficino. One can also read about St Lutgard, (in Book 2 of her biography in Sauer, Volume 3, under the month of June); and this once happened to a monk in the Dominican house in Zamora. He had entered into this pact with a Minorite, and after a number of days \[the Minorite\] appeared to his fellow-covenanter, who was laying tables at the time, and said he was carrying a fire of atonement around with him. As evidence of his torture, he pressed his hand on a thick wooden table and made a very deep burn-mark on it. I have been told by eye-witnesses that the scorch-mark of a hand still exists on the table and, as a perpetual reminder of what happened, has been covered with a small piece of iron lattice-work. (Father Antonio of Siena writes in his history of the Dominicans that one can have no doubts about this incident at all).

When God allows \[a soul\] to return, He does so for the greater good, and for the most part Behemoth takes on this role. It is scarcely possible for this covenant to be made and remain free from the sin of overinquisitiveness, and it is always responsible for discharging its wish for one\'s welfare accompanies by fear and hope. When St Lutgard told a nun that if she were to die first, she would visit her, she added that she would first say the Benedicite, the Lord\'s prayer, and the angelic greeting \[Hail Mary\], \'so that\', she said, \'the Devil cannot introduce any deception, as he usually does.\' (See op.cit. Book 2). If this saint, who was so enlightened, was afraid of this, how much more should we be afraid?

\(iii\) It also follows from what I have been saying that one can easily tell apart the illusions of the various and diverse shapes taken by the apparitions which evil spirits cast in one\'s path, and so now let us examine these further.

Book 2, Question 27, section 1

The appearances of evil spirits, or the apparitions which evil spirits cast in our path.

I must omit two things-the various causes of the illusions, and the various types of evil spirit. The first is obvious, because many things which are natural are considered to be apparitions. Likewise, when they are not what they seem, such things turn out to be caused by a defect of the senses or the weakness of a faulty passive imagination \[phantasiae\]. Let us look at some individual \[examples\], since in the case of most of them \[people\] have followed Pierre Le Loyer. The ignesfatui dealt with earlier are natural, but very liable to be deceptive. I have seen several such things at the shrine of St Audomar in St-Omer. They also exist in Italy, and ancient authors have told us about them in different places-on Lake Vadimo, on the ager Caecubus, and in Rieti.
[Page 179]

There are also trees and woods torn up by the roots, which provide a kind of fleet in the sea, as Pliny the Elder testifies; and rotten pieces of wood which shine at night; and a small Indian creature, a member of the glow-worm family, but larger, like a scarab-beetle, which shines with its whole body, but especially with its eyes which are enormous in comparison with its little body, and pour out so much light that people are in the habit of reading and writing by it. \[The natives\] call it \'coculium\'. It shines with the light of four little stars together, and if anyone smears his hands and face with them, he looks like a burning, frightening ghost \[spectrum\]. (See \[Pedro\] Cieza \[de León\], History of Peru Part 2, chapter 30). Likewise, vapours form themselves into different shapes, such as those looking like goats\' heads, which were seen by Sulla and happened at Epheus, and similar phenomena which, writes Diodorus Siculus, happen for the same reason at Syrtis Major. (He is worth reading on the subject).

Certain sounds-if you don\'t mind my turning from sight to hearing-are remarkable examples of this kind of thing, such as the echoes in various places, which I have also noted elsewhere in my commentary on Seneca\'s tragedies. In Book 18 of his Intricacy \[of Nature\], \[Girolamo\] Cardano says they deceive several people. Likewise, there are the sounds of the statue of Memnon, (which I dealt with in my commentary), those of the wall of Megara, on which see Pausanias in his book on Attica, \[Geography 1.42.2\], the cavern in Britain about which Clement of Alexandria asks, in Book 6 of his Patchwork asks, was it perhaps St Patrick\'s cave? Likewise, the voices of battle and victory on three mountains in Persia, on which see Clement.

Sometimes unskilled physicians are tricked by the extraordinary sounds made by a child from the suffocation of the womb, \'when\', says Cornelius Gemma in Book 1, chapter 7 of his Cosmocratic Art, \'the arteries have been inflated and enlarged by a poisoned gust of air and are then contracted along their length, the result is that one hears extraordinary noises coming from deep within the intestines, now like the croaking of frogs, now like the hissing of snakes, now like the cawing of crows, the crowing of cocks, the barking of dogs, etc. But this tells one there is an emergency because of the relative size of the passages and the \[amount\] of air which is bursting out\'. Just as natural things sometimes deceive, so also do those which are manmade and taken to be ghostly apparitions. This is what happened to Daedalus\'s aútópata, (on which see Aristotle, The Soul Book 1 and The Statesman Book 1), and others by Archimedes, Archytas, and Boethius which I dealt with earlier. In our own times, too, Charles V was presented with a bronze eagle which flew through the air, and in Paris there was a silver trireme which was driven forward, stopped, and driven backwards by oars of the same material. Then there were the water-organs of the ancients and those which cause astonishment in the gardens of the D\'Este family in Tivoli. Claudian says of these instruments,

\'Let him \[the organist\] make a sound with his wandering finger, And let him rouse into song the hard-working waters deep within by means of the wooden lever\'.

(The surviving books of Hero \[of Alexandria\] talk about these \[machines\]). There are man-made apparitions, and in The Variety of Nature, \[Girolamo\] Cardano talks about how they work, as does Battista \[della\] Porta in his book on natural magic, although in fact the character of the things they use adds a great deal of power to the artefact; and in the case of the natural \[apparitions\] I mentioned just now, the engagements of human beings with them brings artificial \[elements\] to them. To this class \[of phenomena\] more properly belong certain people\'s \'artificial\' voices. When others are present, these individuals pretend they are the voices of people who are not there, and although it is their mouth which is speaking, the words seem to emerge from their belly. This way, they counterfeit the voices of angels and evil spirits.
[Page 180]

Likewise, those who speak through tubes at night pretend these are the voices of angels or souls. Some such story about Boniface VIII went the rounds, according to \[Johannes\] Naucler, Massei, and others. Likewise, there are those who pretend they are the souls of dead husbands and in this way persuade widows to marry them. (I know there is someone who frequently does this in Leuven, and \[Pierre\] Le Loyer tells a story in chapter 7 about someone who used to do this in Anjou.)

According to \[Hector\] Boethius \[Boece\], this is how King Kenneth of Scotland conquered the Picts by whom he had been conquered. While the commanders of his army were sleeping at night, he sent servants to them, dressed in shining scale-armour and holding in their hands spears made from rotten wood which glows in the dark, in order to encourage his \[commanders\] to engage bravely with the enemy, saying that they themselves had been sent by God to guarantee victory. The commanders believed they were angels, enthusiastically attacked the Picts, and massacred them.

Several people have made use of crabs and tortoises by fixing little candles on them and thus, more than once, providing the sight of glowing ghosts \[spectrorum\] in cemeteries. This is why a number of people suspect that Homer gave the name \'tortoise\' to a piece of military equipment intended to deceive \[the enemy\] \[a spearhead of magic\]. Stupid youngsters, too, tried to frighten Democritus with a kind of ghost, as Lucian tells us in his Lover of Lies \[32\], and there are very many examples in more recent books, such as Boccaccio\'s Decameron and so forth.

I am more taken, however, with ancient examples in stories such as the one invented by the young slave in Plautus\'s Ghost: or the one the orator Aeschines tells us tells about what Cimon the Athenian did when he pretended to be Scamander in order to corrupt Callirhoe: or the one Josephus tells about Mundus who pretended to be Anubis in order to deceive Paulina: or the one invented about a heathen priest, Tyrannus, who lied about being Saturn so that he could be free to commit adultery with well-born married women. (Rufinus \[of Aquileia\] tells us about this, and St Cyril of Alexandria mentions this same villain in Against Julian Book 7). Nectanebo, an Egyptian magician, transformed himself into the likeness of Jupiter Amun and deceived Olympias, Philip \[of Macedon\'s\] wife, and from this adulterous union was born Alexander the Great-which is how he got the idea that Jupiter was his father. Joseph ben Gorion tells the story in Book 2, chapter 6 of his History of the Jews, and praises the shrewd historians of Egyptian affairs, Titus \[Livy\] of Rome, Strabo of Cappadocia, and Nicolas of Damascus.

The debauchery which takes place in these pieces of fiction is a more serious sin than in the case of straightforward debauchery and should be punished more severely. When the case is one of theft, it should be punished by the penalty for sneak-thieves: the law relating to pick-pockets, Digest, \'On criminal offences which are out of the ordinary\' \[47.11.7\]. If nothing more than fear is inflicted, the matter should be judged in relation to how much danger was involved. \[An offence\] of this kind is, I think, a mortal sin. The penalty is discretionary-a whipping, for example-and if it is followed by deathperpetual exile. (Digest 48.8.4.1, \'lex Cornelia de sicariis\'; Digest 47.2. 68 and 92, \'lex de furtis\'; Digest 47.11, \'lex de extraordinariis criminibus\'; Digest 48.19.30, \'lex de poenis\'; Licinius Rufinus in a comparison of the laws of Moses and \[the opinions\] of \[Roman\] lawyers; and Le Loyer, op.cit. supra, folio 173). I do not think love provides a suitable reason for letting someone off, and Oldradus\'s legal opinion, no. 101, is not sufficiently safe, even though in other respects he is a very good legal counsellor.
[Page 181]

In \[Book 1\], chapter 8, Le Loyer tells us that change or defect in the senses is not an infrequent cause of people\'s seeing apparitions because their sight, or one of their other senses, is deceiving them. He gives the example of drunks about whom St Ambrose gives a very good account. \'This is why meaningless images come to drunks, whose sight is untrustworthy and unsteady. They often jump over shadows as though these were little pits; the ground shakes, along with their face, and seems to rear itself up and lean away from them, and thinking it is whirling around them, they rush straight ahead in fear and clutch at the earth with their hand-or they think mountains are racing together and imprisoning them. They suffer from a roaring in their ears like the crashing of sea waves and

the thunder of the surf on the sea-shore. If they see dogs, they think they are lions and take to their heels. Some dissolve into confused laughter; others wail in inconsolable grief, and others see things which make them irrationally afraid; and they dream while they are awake and quarrel while they are asleep. Before him, Pliny also declares there is no doubt that dreadful sights appear to drunks.

Lavater distorts Holy Scripture, the way his sect usually does, when he interprets the following verse of Solomon as advice against drunkenness: \'Your eyes will see strange women and your heart will speak wickedness\'. \'Strange women\' \[extraneas\], he says, are extraordinary visions and apparitions, and in this he has as his guide \[Santes\] Pagnino who, along with the Chaldaean \[Aramaic\] paraphraser, seems to have accepted \[the Hebrew word\] zaroth as if it were a neuter noun and meant extraneous things.

This, although it did not displease \[Cornelius\] Jansen, is not a good \[interpretation\] because it should be understood in its feminine sense and thus as referring, not to things, but to women. The sense, accepted by St Jerome and Bede, is that wine is the cause of one\'s lusting after foreign women, and therefore, in order to avoid the ambiguity, the Septuagint translates \[the word\] by a singular noun, &Motpiav, \'different\' or \'foreign\' woman. Neither Holy Scripture nor the Fathers \[of the Church\] accept that this word simply refers to another thing rather than another woman, or \'tart\'. See, for example, how it is explained by \[St\] Salonius, Bede, Jerome, and others \[when it occurs\] a little earlier in the same chapter, \[verse 27\]: \'A foreign woman is a deep well.

A cataract makes one see things like flies or jumping ants flying about in front of one\'s eyes, and I have experienced these, not without inconvenience to my studies, for many years already. Ibn Zuhr, (Book 1, chapter 1, discussion 8), mentions a disease called halahol which makes people affected by it think they are seeing double, and to \[eyes\] which are bow-shaped, everything appears reddish-yellow. Aristotle talks about someone who, because of a defect in his eyes, kept thinking he was seeing an image or likeness of himself in the air, as though \[he were\] looking in a mirror. He also testifies that if anyone looks at the sun for a long time and then quickly turns his eyes away to something else, everything he sees will be yellow at first, then reddish, and finally black, until the change in his vision recedes.

Damaged hearing is also accustomed to deceive, such as happens in those people who suffer from the \'fanciful\' disease, as they call it. Learned men tell us there are two types of this sickness. One is better known under the name фреVÎTIS \[inflammation of the brain\], during which spectral images are cast in front of the mind in visible form. Cornelius Celsus and Caelius Aurelianus should be consulted on this type, which belongs to a defect in the passive imagination. The other type is xopußavtiaaµóç. This removes sleep from the vision and imposes a defect on the ears, because of which \[sufferers\] think they are hearing a ringing and loud noise. On this, see Varro in his satire, Prometheus:
[Page 182]

\'The lightly sleeping mind speaks sounding images; The pupils are not overspread with sleep.\'

Damaged taste also deceives sick people in a remarkable way, as does the sense of smell because of a polyp, catarrh, or xópuça \[runny nose\], and that extraordinary catarrh which was prevalent in Castile in 1581, affliction which did away with many people. A more frequent and greater deception, however, flows from the corruption of the passive imagination. This is sometimes conjoined with \'phrenitis\', which is what it is called when it exists alongside a strong fever. Sometimes \[it is conjoined\] with madness. (This is free from fever and lasts longer). Sometimes the fever is insignificant and not enough to lead to phrenitis. The physician Theophilus-in other respects a sensible man-used to think that when someone had a fever, flautists and cornet players should stand near his bed and play in his ears, and he maintained that this \[illness\] had happened to him persistently and he was now cured. Still, one person finds these details boring and another enjoyable. As Horace puts it in his Letter to Florus:

\'At Argos there was once a man, not undistinguished, Who used to believe he was listening to wonderful tragic actors,

And sat happily and applauded in an empty theatreSomeone who would perform all the other duties of life in a perfectly straightforward manner, Undoubtedly a good neighbour, an amiable host, Courteous to his wife: someone who could forgive his slaves And not go mad if the neck of a bottle had been damaged: Someone who could avoid a rock or an open well. This man was restored to health by his kinsfolk\'s help and care. But when his sickness and its bile had been driven out of him by a strong dose of hellebore And he came to himself again, he said, \"Oh dear, oh dear, my friends, you have killed me, Not saved me, because you have taken away a pleasure, And removed by force a delusion of my mind which gave me much delight,\" \[Epistles 2.2.vv.129-140\].

In his book on the extraordinary things one hears, Aristotle tells us that a similar thing happened in Abydos and, in connection with the pleasure a mad false notion \[can give\], in Book 4 of his Motley History, Aelian gives evidence at length about someone called Thrasyllus who thought that every ship which came to Piraeus belonged to him.

But let us return to imaginary apparitions. I don\'t know of anything which has happened less frequently than an incident related by Timaeus of Locri. \'There was a house in Agrigentum which was called \"The Trireme\" because of the following incident. Some young men\', (from Tauromenium), \'were attending a drinks party there. They started to become somewhat merry and, as usually happens not long afterwards, when they had become well and truly flushed, they were at such mental cross-purposes and so beside themselves that they thought they had been deposited in a trireme, and that a dreadful storm was tossing them on a sea full of swelling and plunging waves.

So, as though they were afraid that the ship would be wrecked because the things in the house were being thrown around, in order to lessen \[the effects of that shipwreck, they started to throw all the plates and anything else they came across in the fuddled state, into the road, or \"sea\", and people ran from all over the place to plunder what had been thrown away. The next day, when they came before magistrates who charged them with what they had done, they replied, (because they had not had enough sleep), that the fear of death had made them prefer to destroy what was in the ship rather than be devoured, themselves, by the waves. Everyone was amazed at their stupidity, and one of their number who seemed to be somewhat older, said, \"Sons of Neptune, I was so afraid, I threw myself under the beds and lay down in the bottom \[of the boat\]\".
[Page 183]

Since they were seen to be even more out of their wits, they were dismissed by the examining magistrate, who quite seriously impressed upon them that they should be wary of any other brutish invitation of this kind. They, however, pretending to thank him, said, \"If we are preserved from such stormy waves and make our way back to harbour, we shall raise statues to you in our own country as our saviours, along with \[those\] of other gods of the sea, Sons of Neptune\". (Thus Caelius Rhodiginus, deriving \[the story\] from Athenaeus.)

People suffering from hydrophobia run away from water because in it they see the dog which bit them. The Devil is in the habit of frequently adding himself to these natural illnesses and abusing humans\' tendency \[to catch them\]. \'This evil, says St Augustine, \'which comes from the Devil, creeps through every entrance of the senses, gives itself to shapes, adapts itself to colours, adheres to sounds, underlies smells, pours itself in by means of flavours, and fills all the pathways of understanding with little clouds. Sometimes it tortures cruelly with grief and fear; sometimes it distracts by means of jokes, or mocks by means of stageplays,\' \[Book of Eighty-Three Questions\].

Book 2, Question 27, Section 2

Just as evil spirits have various ways of working and various wilful caprices, so there are various kinds of them, as I noted in \[Book 1, chapter 2\]. They are all foul and wicked and hostile to human beings, as Porphyry, who lived after Chrysippus, Plutarch, and Philo, rightly says in opposition to Iamblichus. Minucius \[Felix\] makes a better job of it than he in his Octavius. Marcus, in The Way Evil Spirits Operate, by Psellus, divides them into six kinds, as Orpheus before him had done when he wrote to Musaeus:

\'Evil spirits of the sky, the air, the waters, the earth, and beneath the earth, or \"summanes\".

In Eusebius\'s Proof of the Gospel, Book 4, Apollo himself recites the following:

\'They are partly rulers of the earth, partly rulers of the heavens, and sometimes of the upper air, And of the lower air which penetrates damp places, And of the seas and everything below the earth, Because they are in control of everything by means of the abundance of these natural things.\'

He calls celestial \[spirits\] \'ethereal\' or \'fiery\', as Marcus does. Plato also knew of aery \[spirits\] and attributed the discovery of magic to them. The Chaldaeans, along with Zoroaster, call terrestrial \[spirits\] \'wild\', or \'earthly dogs\', (as Psellus explains), because in Zoroaster\'s Magical \[Prophecies\] we read: \'because wild animals will inhabit your vessel of the earth\'. Psellus adds to this, \'\[evil spirits\] who roam around the earth\', are wild animals of the earth\'. I much prefer this version to that of Pletho: \'worms and all kinds of fouler creeping things.\' This same magician later adds: \'they undoubtedly produce earthly dogs from the bosom of the earth and never show a human being a genuine sign\'.

Pletho means they usually appear in the shape of dogs or some other loathsome type of thing to those who are being initiated in sacred rites, and even though Zoroaster accepted this in connection with magical ceremonies, it is also true that these apparitions are also in the habit of disturbing those who have forsaken a wicked course of life and devoted themselves to any monastic order. (Le Loyer confirms this with evidence from the Jews in a work they call Holam Abba). Athanasius says the same in his biography of St Antony, and Abbot Everwinus relates things quite like this about St Simeon of Trier, (Sauer, under ist June), and one can read other accounts elsewhere in the life of St Norbert, about an evil spirit which disturbed the ceremonies at the holy foundation of the Premonstratensians. (See chapters 19, 26, and 27 of St Simeon\'s biography in Sauer, under 6th June.)
[Page 184]

I can confirm this, because it actually happened at the start of my own Society, when a college was founded by Fr. Ignatius \[Loyola\] in Loreto. Its rector-in charge was Fr. Olivier Manare, who was still with us at the time, and who gave me an absolutely accurate account of it, which I shall add now. In 1555 malicious spirits \[spiritus\] were disturbing first one place, then another with loud crashing and banging, causing a remarkable amount of trouble, and depriving a very large number \[of brethren\] of their rest, among whom several were novices in the religious life. They also used to appear in broad daylight in different shapes. An evil spirit appeared to one brother in the form of an \'Aithiopian\' with many enticing and persuasive words to make him leave the religious life. But when he saw that his effort was in vain, he went away, accompanied by very heavy breathing and a foul stench which lasted the whole day.

He manifested himself to another brother in the likeness of St Paul and began to urge him to a devout reading and study of his Epistles so that, on this specious pretext, he could draw him away from his attention to his liberal studies and thus push him into disobedience and out of the religious community-which he was successful in doing. He met Olivier \[Manare\] himself, in the shape of a very large black Molossian hound, jumped up at him and nearly threw him to the ground. He would thrust and push in the form of a mewing cat against the bench on which brethren were resting while they prayed, and rub up against them more than once, in order to divert or destroy their concentration.

There was no peace while the brethren were asleep, and meal-times were not allowed to pass without disturbance. Those who were resting would repeatedly feel little cats climbing on to the bed and getting under the covers, and this filled many brethren with fear and would deprive them of sleep and make them get out from under their blankets. While he was having breakfast, one brother was struck so hard on his side by the fist of an unseen assailant that he turned very pale at once, and almost fell backwards off his bench.

This molestation of his flock caused the rector a lot of annoyance. He tried \[those of\] the Church\'s remedies which would meet the case-Masses, prayers, exorcisms, holy water, holy relics, and other such things. But God did not want the evil to be removed entirely by these. Therefore, Olivier had recourse to the father they all had in common, St Ignatius, and asked for his prayers and help in this molestation. Because he was clearly depressed, Ignatius wrote him a letter, exhorting him to patience and urging him to use those remedies the Church usually employs in similar situations. \'We have already looked to these and tried them all\', said Olivier in a letter, \'but the evil is still with us and is becoming worse\'.

When he received this letter, Fr. Ignatius replied, \'Put your trust in the Lord, and in His goodness. He will set you free, and I shall pray earnestly for you.\' When he received this letter, the rector read it to a circle of Fathers and brethren who by chance had gathered together at the time and, (marvellous to relate), that infestation of apparitions and phantasms instantly stopped, with the result that nothing of the kind was heard or seen again afterwards in Loreto. From a letter written later, we are left in no doubt that the best of Fathers began to pray for his sons and kept on praying as long as letters were carried from Rome to Loreto.

Zoroaster, therefore, calls these \[spirits\] \'earthly dogs\', and \[he does so\] either because of the form they have taken, (which is why Pletho, too, calls them dogs), or, (as Psellus does), because they are the executioners of souls. \'They are earthly\', he says, \'because they fell from Heaven and flutter round the earth\'.
[Page 185]

But what Psellus, or \'Marcus\', \[noted\] briefly about the \[different\] kinds of evil spirits, which he inferred from where they live, Trithemius wrote in much greater detail, and I shall be happy to quote his words from question 5 of his Questions to the Emperor Maximilian, with many additions which I judge to be relevant to an explanation and discussion of magic. \'Just as evil spirits\', he says, \'differ from one another in the power and cunning of their subtlety, so also the power of female workers of harmful magic \[maleficarum\] is not one and the same in all of them, but different in each individual, so they turn out to be in evil spirits which are more refined in disposition or more gross.

There are, you see, many kinds of evil spirit and there are particular degrees of difference between them because of the places into which they fell after they were initially driven away \[from Heaven\] The first kind of evil spirit is called \'fiery\'? It wanders around the upper air and will not be thrust to the lower regions at any time before the Day of Judgement. Even though \[these spirits\] remain continually in regions below the moon, they have no traffic with human beings on earth. That they really do stay beneath the moon St Augustine also testifies in his book Christian Combat, where he says that evil spirits do not live in the sky where the sun and stars are, but that they all remain beneath the region of the moon. That apart, I think Apuleius said that living creatures are made of fire. I think he did so particularly because Aristotle maintained that certain tiny living creatures have often been seen fluttering round, with little wings attached to them, in burning furnaces. These pass their whole life in fire, since they are born with fire and are extinguished along with it, vanishing and returning to their own place from which they originally came\'. (St Augustine\'s reference is from chapter 3.)

St Augustine simply says that evil spirits do not live in Heaven, from where they fell, or in the firmament. He adds nothing about a sphere of fire, so his words have nothing to do with proving \[the existence of\] this first kind. \[Trithemius\] was mistaken in his reference to Apuleius, because he actually did attribute fiery bodies to evil spirits. Finally, those living creature were not evil spirits as far as Aristotle was concerned, but a kind of ephemeral flying insect usually found in furnaces on Cyprus.

If Apuleius thought they were evil spirits, how could he have imagined they are extinguished along with the fire, or are produced along with the fire, since it was thought, in accordance with the principles of his sect, that evil spirits are immortal and not subject to death? Perhaps he meant that when a fire has been lit, one begins to see evil spirits in the flames under the form he describes, and that they cease to appear when the flame is extinguished. But \[Trithemius\] goes on, \'There are no traits in common between these and workers of harmful magic \[maleficis\] because when they linger in the fire they cannot, by reason of the refinement of their \[bodies\] put on a gross or aery body\'. Worthless reasoning!

If there is no sphere of fire, as many people think, this whole fiction falls to the ground. If, by chance, such a sphere does exist, it still does not follow from this that evil spirits of this kind do not traffic with workers of harmful magic, because evil spirits do not have a body of their own, but are simply substances of spirit which, even when thickened as earthly, fiery, or aery substances, are not like a body at all. Therefore, either they do traffic with workers of harmful magic, or one must look for another explanation of this phenomenon, and I have not yet been able to find one. Why, too, is it necessary to enclose these \[spirits\] in fire, that prison outwith Hell, which is in the centre of the earth, as if they do not carry their punishment around them wherever they are? I believe, therefore, that this kind of evil spirit is fictitious and was called \'celestial\' by Orpheus because he thought they lived in the heavens. Others call them \'fiery\', perhaps because they have remained in the higher regions of the air.
[Page 186]

\'The second type is called \"aery\", \[says Trithemius\], \'because it wanders about and lingers in the air which is near us. These are certainly able to descend to the lower regions and, having assumed bodies made of this grosser air, sometimes appear to human beings. With God\'s permission, they quite frequently throw the air into confusion and stir up thunder-claps and storms. All plot the destruction of the human race. Just like humans, they are moved by strong emotions, especially pride and envy, and are affected by continual disquiets. They are not clothed in a solid body and do not stay in one place. Nor do they have a single form, but very many, and change them quite often according to alterations in their mood; and when they have been evoked by the incantations of female workers of harmful magic, or when they have been driven to do so by their disquiets, they come to these women in these \[forms\] in order to do harm\'. One should take note of this error, too, and avoid it-that evil spirits have any body of their own at all, or are born with one, or are endowed with any form visible to humans\' physical eyes. They can be seen only in the form of a body they have fashioned from outside, or of a corpse they have assumed.

He goes on: \'They have a character which is entirely violent, full of rage, and filled with perturbation, which is why these extremely mischievous and thoroughly disturbed \[spirits\] contrive ambushes, (for the most part unexpected); and while they are carrying out their assaults, some of them want to remain hidden and others carry on with the violence. Female workers of harmful magic are propped up by the work of these evil spirits, and the more the women have attained a higher concurrent authority in their order, the more power they have to work evil. \'I think all this is true.

In his biography of St Antony, St Athanasius said that the air is full of evil spirits and, of course, before him Hermes Trismegistus said that there is no part of the world which is without the presence of evil spirits. This must be understood as referring to the sublunary world, otherwise what St Augustine says in chapter 3 of his Christian Combat is not true. Now listen to what \[Trithemius\] says. \'Bishop St Ambrose said, \"The world is full of holy powers because it is full of evil \[spirits\] Be careful of what follows because, in his usual fashion, \[Trithemius\] mixes falsehood with truth. \'Consequently, Platonists have proposed that evil spirits fly in the air like very thick snow which has been set on fire, and that they can be seen by those who want \[to see them\] if people will keep looking steadily at the sky while the sun is shining. But I do not know whether an object is in the air because it actually is there, or whether in fact a blocked movement of the eyes causes one to see false images. Not without slight misgiving, I am satisfied with the experience of those people I have just mentioned.\' A deceptive experience indeed, good for nothing, and worthy of a greater misgiving-its mother being Inquisitiveness and its father Ignorance! It was an illusion of the sense, with the result that you thought you were seeing something which was not, in the nature of things, visible. At least children can notice that the brightness of the sun blinded \[those people\'s\] eyes like that!

\'We call the third kind of evil spirit \"terrestrial\" and have no doubt that they fell from Heaven to earth because of their moral failings\'. Catholics consider there is no doubt that evil spirits of the air, too, fell from Heaven because of their moral failings. \'The most holy bishop and martyr of Christ, the late Ignatius \[of Antioch\], wrote about these as follows in a letter to the Ephesians. \"There is nothing better than to have a peace in which every weapon of the spirits of the air and of the earth as well is rendered null and void\". You see that St Ignatius did not know the spirits of fire \[Trithemius\] mentioned, and in my opinion, he classed the spirits of water under the heading \'terrestrial\'. I have already said several things about terrestrial spirits.
[Page 187]

Trithemius, rather lengthily, adds a number of points by way of illustration. \'Some of these evil spirits live in woods and groves. They set traps for hunters. Others, however, dwell in wide open countryside and cause travellers to go astray at night. Several linger in hidden places and caverns. The rest, less frenzied and disturbed than the others, take pleasure in staying with human beings in the dark\'. All the types-fourteen of them-which I shall adduce in a moment from various authors, belong to this group. \[There is\], for example, the \'faun\', also called \'the prophesying faun\' and \'the little prophesying faun\', and satyrs who are also called \'noises\' and \'females with asses\' legs\', about which Sozomen tells us in his \[History of the Church\] Book 8, chapter 6, where he mentions Gerontius, the deacon, who was punished by St Ambrose and discharged from his service by Nectarius because he kept on insisting he had got hold of \'She with asses\' legs\' at night by her shaved head and thrown her into a mill. The holy men thought, not without good reason, that this meant he had been trafficking with the demon \'She with asses\' legs\', although they did not condemn him for maintaining his belief in evil spirits of this name. This is how one should interpret what Nectarius and Ambrose did.

In talking about this type of spirit, \[Marco\] Stellato imagined they had attached Sarracilus, Sathiel, and Iana to him as companions during a journey by moonlight, but poetically, (that is, mendaciously), he supposes them as saying that their home was on the moon. In his Festive Days, \[Alessandro\] Alessandri also tells us about a spirit such as this which appeared to the monk Thomas. Spirits such as these are \'lamiae\', which the Jews call Lilith, \[deriving the name\] from \'night\'.

Such a kind are Ceres, Diana with the members of her entourage, \'nymphs of the small valley\', dryads, hamadryads, Trophonius, and similar pseudo-deities. Such are the prophesying fauns, the Furies and their mother Furina, (so the tale goes), Mana, the mother of the Summanes, Mantua, Mania the bugaboo, Manuana, and spirits like these, believed to be masculine-the \'swarthies\', the Summanes, and the \'deluders\', about which Martianus Capella talks in Book 2 \[of The Wedding of Philology and Mercury\], Isidore in his Etymologies, and Arnobius in Against the Heathen. In a short while I, too, shall say several things about the cave-dwellers. \[Trithemius\] adds, \'They are guided, not by a single emotion, but by many different ones, because some are less depraved than others, although they are all filled with wicked emotions. Certain of them take pleasure in frightening human beings simply with illusions, but others want to draw them to listen to them and be astonished by their predictions of future events. Several, however, direct their greatest effort to frighten, harm, or kill human beings who have been thrown into confusion by an irrational madness, or are out of their minds because of their melancholy; and this we know from experience has happened quite often\'.

Consequently, in the third Book of his God\'s Providence, addressed to the monk Stagyrius, St John Chrysostom says, \'The great ability of grief to do harm becomes more powerful with each action by the Devil, because the evil spirit overwhelms everyone, overwhelms everyone through grief. If, however, one removes that, the evil spirit will not be able to harm anyone at all\'. All this is perfectly clear, and what follows straight away is sensible, although not equally clear. This kind of evil spirit is rarely a close companion of workers of harmful magic because it is emotionally unreliable and fickle. These creatures enjoy terrifying large numbers of people rather than being at the beck and call of a foolish woman\'.

This argument is utterly trivial and is based on the false presupposition that they can be near at hand or lie concealed. That is not true. They cannot be near one person and still terrify large numbers. But they sometimes hang about and make promises to mad people in a glass vessel, or a crystal, or a mirror. When roused by magical incantations, they give replies to silly women, and they tell them if anyone who is about to come their way has cursed them. Anyway, after they have done that, evil spirits do not spend time on these activities, but carry out other functions for them. \'This kind of female worker of harmful magic\', says \[Trithemius\], \'is very different from the rest because when they make someone ill through harmful magic, they promise to cure them. But because for the most part they repel harmful magic by means of harmful magic, the Church forbids all Christians to come near them\'. This is perfectly true, and because of that it appears that Satan\'s kingdom is superhuman, and you have the reason for the disreputable hatred which exists between prophesiers \[ariolos\] or \'truth-tellers\' \[veratores\] and magicians who deal in poisons \[magos venenarios and vampire witches \[striges\] The former try to expose and betray the latter, the latter in their turn secretly lay traps for the former.
[Page 188]

\'The fourth kind of evil spirits is called \"watery\" because they immerse themselves in liquids and live round streams and lakes. They are full of anger, agitated, restless, and deceitful. They raise storms at sea, plunge ships into the deep, and take away the lives of many in the waters. Whenever these evil spirits assume a visible body, they appear quite often as females. They are more rarely seen as males, particularly because they live in wet places, live a more delicate kind of life, and cannot easily take on the masculine shape of the others.\' False reasoning from a false fundamental premise about their physical constitution. If they are spirits, (as they are), why do they compose a female form from water mixed with the other elements rather than a male form from air? Why can they not as easily assume a male body as a female one? \'

Hence antiquity gave Naiads, Nereids, and nymphs of the waters female rather than male names.\' But the same antiquity gave Neptune, Nereus, Proteus, Phorcus, Glaucus, Palaemon, the Tritons, Achelous, Alpheus, Tiber, and so on male names. His next remark is beside the point as well. \'But our \[people\] call them \"water-women\", that is \"Wasserfrauen\" in the vernacular\'. But Germans in the Spanish Netherlands call them by the masculine name \'Neckers\'. \[Thomas of\] Cantimpré calls them \'Neptunes\' in an anecdote about a particular man in his Bees Book 2, chapter 57, page 11.

There were watery evil spirits who, on the very day Syracuse was captured by the Saracens, gave the news to Peloponnesian shepherds who were near their swamp. (See \[Tomasso\] Fazello, Two Decades on Sicilian Affairs Book 6). Because of the attentions of this kind of evil spirit, a person who perjured himself was plunged into the lakes of the Palisci, (a place which is now called Naphthia), as Aristotle, Diodorus, and Macrobius tell us. Near the town of Ihomisum \[Comiso in Sicily\], there is the \'spring of Diana\' which flows into Camarina. In ancient times, if any with dirty hands diluted wine with this water, the wine and water would not mix. In the territory of Alesinum, today known as Caronia, there was once a spring which was usually calm, but when pipes were played harmoniously, it would start to swell and overflow its banks. (See Fazello, first decade, Book 1, chapter 5).

These things were either fairy-tales, or they happened because of the cooperation of evil spirits. The evidence is that they no longer happen. One comes back to what Trithemius says. \'Whenever those which live in rather dry, parched places appear in visible form to human beings, they transform themselves into men\'. Not even this is believable. He tells us that witches \[striges\] also have dealings with this kind of tart and he \[gives them the names \'Naparaeae\', \'Dryades\', and \'Desert-dwelling Lamiae\'. \'These types also assume \[the forms\] of various kinds of brute beast in accordance with the way they are moved by various emotions. But since holy angels\' emotions never vary, they always appear the same way, in the shape of a man. Nowhere have I seen it written that a good spirit has been seen in the form of a woman or any animal.

They have always had the appearance of a man\'. I have already pointed out that this last remark about angels\' apparitions is not particularly well-established, (on which see this Book, question 26, section 3, about the end of the letter I). The argument about the unchangeability of their emotions has little to support it, because just as an angel is unchangeable with respect to evil, so is the Devil with respect to good; and just as the Devil is disposed to evil now in this way, now in that, so also is an angel to good. So, just as an evil spirit adopts one \[form\] in order to satisfy one state of mind with respect to a particular evil \[deed\], and adopts another \[to satisfy\] a different \[state of mind\], what is there to stop an angel from adopting various forms not unworthy of itself as well, in order to undertake various good purposes? Finally, one must make sure that \[Trithemius\] is not saying anything which is inconsistent with an angel\'s freedom to make up his own mind.
[Page 189]

\'But evil spirits have often been seen in the neighbourhood of rivers and springs, sometimes looking like women dancing, sometimes spreading out their hair the way women do, but on occasion speaking with human beings and jeering at them. This type does not usually have dealings with workers of harmful magic\'. Stories told by the ancients, however, indicate that they have been accustomed \[to have dealings with\] human beings the way strumpets do, although to some extent they have been confirmed in the case of Morgana, Melusine, Alcina, and the like, which are popularly known as \'fates\' or \'fairies.\' (See more about these elsewhere in this chapter, about section 14.)

\'The fifth kind is called \"subterranean\" because they dwell in caves, caverns, and remote hollows in mountains. These evil spirits have the worst temperament, attack those in particular who dig wells and mines and look for treasure hidden in the earth and are fully prepared to destroy the human race. They form clefts in the earth, raise up winds which belch forth flames, and shake the foundations of the earth\'. In Eusebius, Book 4, Apollo, by way of description, calls this kind uπoxdovíous and veptepíous, \'subterraneans\' and \'undergrounders\'. Did Satan, Job\'s tormentor, belong to this kind of \[evil spirit\] I think so, and so did those who were still teaching the superstitious techniques of harmful magic in Salamanca and Toledo within the memory of our grandfathers. \'Sometimes at night, adds \[Trithemius\], \'troops of them come out from the mountains and lead wonderful, amazing dances on the plains \[below\] and, as though they are in fear of their single leader, at his signal they suddenly vanish and return to their lurking places.

Occasionally one hears the sound of little bells in the midst of them, and sometimes they pretend they are the spirits of dead human beings.\' Pliny tells a memorable story about their dances and the different sound \[they make\] on Mt Atlas, (Inquiry into Nature Book 5, chapter 1.) So does Solinus, The Wonders of the World, chapter 37. He calls these evil spirits \'Aegipanes\', and Saxo the Grammarian describes the dance and gives the names of every kind of evil spirit in Book 1 of his history of Denmark.

\'The savage troop of dancing ghosts is carried forward and runs to and fro along the wind, And makes harsh noises in the direction of the stars. Fauns come together with satyrs, and a body of Pans Mingled with spirits of the dead fights with a wild look on their faces. Swarthy \[spirits\]⁴⁷⁸ come together with those who dwell in forests, and hobgoblins who do harm Are eager to share the stony footpath with vampire witches. Furies leap forward and the hobgoblins crowd together with them; And a prophetess, together with sub-nosed \[spirits\], jostles them\'.

I shall give many examples of warlike squadrons in a moment when I discuss the household of Hellequin, which is also mentioned by Thomas of Cantimpré, (Book 2, chapter 49, page 4); and perhaps in connection with this I should refer to an emendation by Peter of Blois (letter 14)-\'soldiers of Herkelin\' or \'of Herleurin\'-when he is talking about court officials or courtiers who often wander about late at night. All the codices have different readings and there does not seem to be any satisfactory emendation, as Fr. Jan Buys has diligently signified in his notes on that passage.

I do not so much reject his conjecture as put forward something which has come into my head-that, in connection with this, one should refer to the ghosts \[spectra\] belonging to the night in Frisia, about which Cornelius Kempius \[writes\] in Book 3, chapter 31 of his Origin of the Frisians. (In Book 6 I shall quote what he says). Perhaps, too, the armies which appeared in Spain to someone called Sanchez belonged to this category. Peter of Cluny, a writer of that period, wrote about them, but I shall aside what he said, even though it would be appropriate to insert it here. (I found the passage some time ago in Book 3, part 1, question 7, section 1, versicle 11). Now for Trithemius. \'They seek nothing more than to frighten human beings and astonish them. Consequently, we have found that sometimes they have led rather disingenuous people into their hiding-places in the mountains and shown them, much to their astonishment, the most extraordinary sights and pretended they are friends of the living, as though these \[places\] were the mansions of the blessed\'.
[Page 190]

From wanton nonsense of this kind arose stories about the Hill of Venus, which Pius II mentioned in his letters, the Sibyl\'s cave in Ancona described by Antoine de la Sale, the hill of the white women in Kempius\'s book, (the Alvinnem berg in Brabant), the Cave of Nursus in Italy, and the Sibyl who lived there who is mentioned by his Holiness Pius II in letter 46. There are also the amazing things reported from court records by \[Pierre\] Crespet, from which magicians\' extraordinary blindness becomes apparent. In his book, The Hatred of Satan, discourse 6, \[Crespet\] refers to a Domenico Mirabelli from Arpino. He, along with his step-mother, Marguerite Garnier and other accomplices, was arrested in Mantes la Jolie in France and brought to Paris, along with books on magic which they were taking to be consecrated by the presiding sybils of magic.

This Domenico confessed in court that an associate of his, known as \'the Scotsman\', who had lived in France for a long time, had the reputation of being a necromancer and had carried out remarkable trials of his skill in front of various princes. Quite a few of them had become his students, \[although\] he had taught them nothing worthwhile. This Scotsman had made his way to and met the famous Sybil who, people said, lived in the Cave of Nursus in Italy. He reported that she was a tiny woman who sat on a low stool, and that her hair was loose and hung down to the ground. She gave him a consecrated book and an evil spirit enclosed in a ring to wear on his finger. The book and the evil spirit could be made to work anywhere he might wish, as long as an adverse wind was not blowing on him as he was about to go there. (Do laugh, Reader! The wind is stronger than the evil spirit? Do laugh, too, at the following pieces of fiction regarding magic).

He also said that the supreme Pontiff had placed guards who guard the cave with the utmost care so that no one can take himself off, go there, and consult the sibyl, and that no one can reach her except those who have been initiated into magic and know how to make themselves invisible. This is because when anyone is speaking with her, whether he is a magician or not, dreadful storms and lightning-flashes disturb the whole surrounding countryside.

This is what \[Marco\] Stellato meant to imply in these verses from Book 2:

\'Either the gods of the air or the stars send these winds. Indeed, often when a magician wants to remove Treasure which is lying hidden in the earth, Or to consecrate a book, Or to bring any deity under his control by means of a magic ritual, I have been told he raises a wind and a sudden storm\'.

(Crespet adds that these Sibyls willingly guard flocks of sheep and live among cattle. This is not the reason. It is because shepherds and herdsmen are usually rather simple-minded and somewhat dull-witted, and have plenty of time on their hands, and so are more exposed to being ambushed by these evil spirits.)

The following comes from Trithemius. \'Among these evil spirits, too, there are some which guard the treasures the greed of mortals has hidden in the earth, and so that \[these treasures\] do not come again into human use, \[the spirits\] remove them, steal them, and keep an eye on them, and every so often take them from one place to another\'. The dreadful dog and the half-woman half snake are examples of this kind of spirit. (I have deal with them in Book 2, question 12, at about 10, letter G, and see below, question 28 at the end). \'This kind of evil spirit does not usually have anything to do with women who work harmful magic\'. (Whether one believes this depends on who is saying it). I add to these treasure-guardians their governor, Mammon, whom the ancients called \'Plutus\'. Enchanters almost always invoke him to no effect, for the most part accompanied by the loss of both their physical and spiritual lives, and never without the loss of the better of the two.
[Page 191]

\'The sixth kind of evil spirit is called \'light-shunner\' because they have an absolute horror of light and hate it. In consequence, they never appear during the day and cannot assume a body in any fashion other than that of the night. This is \"the terror which walks by night\". This kind of evil spirit is inscrutable, utterly gloomy, driven by cold passions, malicious, restless, and thoroughly disturbed. It violently stops people who meet it during the hours of night from going further and quite often, if God permit, kills some of them with a breath or a touch\'.

I am not at all sure whether Asmodeus, about whom one reads in the Book of Tobit, belonged to this type. But I think the pagan idea that Cerberus and ghosts wander about at night and are imprisoned again once the light has risen had its origins in this type of spirit. (You can read what I have said \[about this\] above in question 26, section 1, at letter B). The Jews say the spirit which wrestled with Jacob was one such, and Origen follows them in First Principles Book 3, but the context quite clearly indicates, and the fairly general tradition of the Greek and Latin Fathers \[of the Church\] tells us, that it was a good angel, who was representing God. The Targumatic commentators on Psalm 90, verses 5 and 6, acknowledge \[the existence\] of light-shunners, and in Book 2 of his Persian War, Procopius gives a sign that he does, too. I think Hecate belongs to this type. (See what I shall say about her a little later in subsection 8, at letters G and H).

The Abbot of Spanheim \[Trithemius\] goes on to say, \'This kind of evil spirit does not meet workers of harmful magic and cannot be confined by incantations because it runs away from the light, the voice of human beings, and also any kind of disturbance\'. This is not a good enough reason for us to say that lightshunners do not have any dealings with human beings, because the real reason for this traffic is to offend God and destroy human beings, and this is how they have their place among these and the other kinds \[of evil spirit\]. The power of their predisposition to hate God and humans-\[: a predisposition\] they and this type which, as Trithemius said, excels in malice, all have-is both great and strong and increases every day. But it can happen that this \[sixth kind\] find it more difficult to make pacts and that they do so less frequently than the others because of a kind of peevishness and aversion from all social intercourse.

\[Trithemius\] goes on to say, \'The aery kind is most particularly accustomed to fall in with women\'s acts of harmful magic because it is more full of guile and the most presumptuous foolhardiness\' I think he did not want to say they fall in with men\'s acts of harmful magic as well. What reason can there be, if they are very foolhardy and very full of guile, for them to stand in awe of men, quite a few of whom, it is generally agreed, end up ensnared? Why should they love to trap and drag to their destruction only women and not men? It looks as though the Abbot mentioned the \[case\] of women only because far more women are always being arrested for this offence. (I am talking about witchcraft \[strigatione\], because perhaps you can find more men who are enchanters or fortune-tellers.)

\'Several of the terrestrial \[kind\], too, it is said, humour workers of harmful magic, although they are of an inferior rank and cannot perform the more powerful acts of harmful magic at all\'. I acknowledge that evil spirits do not all have the same power, but I think there is not one of them that cannot, with God\'s permission, destroy crops, raise storms, produce rain, and kill human beings with acts of poisonous magic \[veneficiis\]. I also think that not a few familiars and household manikins belong to this terrestrial type. But God and the angels know that we human beings cannot be sure about any of this. So, I have set out this demonology in Trithemius\'s words and added a few things which the doctrine of correct philosophy suggested to me as I was writing. Now let me continue and, in as far as my reading of a large number of books will be of assistance, I shall confirm my individual points with examples and the authority of historical accounts.
[Page 192]

Evil spirits are called malachim ra-aim in Hebrew, \'wicked angels: rasha\'galioth, \'heads or leaders of captivity\': satanim, \'slanderers\', (from which Arabic satainim is derived): el-elim, \'deceptions\' or \'phantoms\', (from which is derived Greek ÉXEXEÚS, the surname of Bacchus): and shedim, \'evil spirits\'.

In Greek they are called πveúµata πháva and πveúµata πóvnpa, \'deceiving spirits\' and \'morally worthless spirits\', and δaínoves áπò TOÛ Saluoveîv, \'evil spirits, derived from \[the word\] Saluoveîv,\' because they strike terror \[into people\]. All around the world, many whisper silently the true name of these sprits -- the shelby, or, in some circles, Elbysh.

In Latin the ones we are dealing with are \'manes\' \[the souls of dead ancestors\], \'lares\', \[spirits of the household\], \'genii\' \[spirits of a particular place or person\], \'larvae\' \[hobgoblins\], and \'lemures\' \[ghosts of the dead\]. In French they are called \'gueliers\' \[hunters\], \'lutins\', \[hobgoblins\], \'gobelins\', \[evil gnomes\], \'moynes bourez\', \[spirits of the countryside\], and loupsgaroux\' \[werewolves\]; in Italian, \'farfarelli\', \[goblins\], \'mazzaruoli\', and \'mazzapengoli\', \[spirits which knock you on the head\]; and in Spanish, \'trazgos\', \[goblins\] and \'duendes\', \[house-spirits\].

In times past they appeared in more forms than they do now, and from them came a large number of the ancients\' gods of the underworld. I have now spoken about the spirits of a particular place \[geniis\], ghosts of the dead \[lemuribus\], spirits of the household \[laribus\], and the souls of dead ancestors \[manibus\]. Let us have a look at others.

1\. First one comes across Hecate who presides over the places where three roads and four roads meet. She has three faces. The one on the right is that of a horse, the one on the left that of a dog, and the one in the middle that of a woman. \[The ancients\] used to think that this \[goddess\] despatches ghostly terrors, that at her arrival the ground would tremble, and that one could see brilliant flashes of lightning, which Seneca calls \'sacred fires\'. She would come surrounded by many dogs whose dreadful howling and barking would be heard. According to the scholiast on Apollonius Book 3, when she changed this appearance, she was called \'Empusa\', but other people distinguish between the two. She was the wife of Pluto and was also known as \'Proserpina\'. I learn about Hecate\'s dogs from Eusebius: \'Yaia δ\' ÉµWv σкилánwv Svopepòv γévos nvioxéúel: \'but the earth carries the tribe of my black whelps\'. By these words she signifies that she is command of the ethereal and aery spirits, and she adds that the terrestrial \[spirits\] also obey her. Zoroaster wrote verses which say that these appear to the Magi when they are making sacrifices. These words accompany those I quoted earlier at the beginning of this section.

2\. Pluto: the Greeks call him \"Aions because he brought death into the world. \[His name is derived\] from the Hebrew ed. He is also called \'Plutus\', the god of riches, which is the equivalent of Hebrew or Syriac Mammona. By the Egyptians he is called \'Serapis\', that is, \'burning\', from the Hebrew word saraph. Others maintain it means \'the sun\', and this receives confirmation in Macrobius, Saturnalia Book 1.1.20 and, somewhat less clearly, in Eusebius, Proof of the Gospel Book 5.

3\. Charon, a word of Hebrew origin, denotes someone who is filled with anger and frenzy. Vergil\'s Aeneid Book 6 and Seneca\'s Hercules Furens provide us with examples.

4\. According to Le Loyer, \'Cerberus\' can be derived from celeb ha aretz, that is, \'dog of the earth\', because Zoroaster has told us that this is how evil spirits are called.

5\. There are also wrestling evil spirits which used to force human beings to wrestle. The radapvaios \[murderer, avenging spirit\] Temesius which used to trouble Temesa was one of these. He pretended he was the soul of Polita who had been murdered by the Bruttii. The Greek have a great deal to say about this one. He would ape the angel who wrestled with the patriarch Jacob.
[Page 193]

6\. Those which are called \'alastores\' \[tormentors\] were extremely ferocious. Perhaps they were the same as the alastor Nemesis, because \[the ancients\] used to imagine that Nemesis was the avenger of crimes. In Against Celsus, Origen attributed this duty to \'Alastor\', Zoroaster called him \'the executioner\', and the scholiast to Euripides\'s Medea thought he was so called because no crime at all remained hidden from him-öv oux \"OTI hateiv, \[it cannot escape his notice\]. I think, on the other hand, that no crime escapes him or lies hidden from him because God allows him to get rid of them and destroy them.

Perhaps this \[spirit\] is the destroyer which appears in Apocalypse \[9.11\], the king of locusts, the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is \'Abaddon\', in Greek, \'Apollyon\', and in Latin \'the one who destroys\', (\'Abaddon\', áπoMúov), where Primasius \[of Hadrumetum\] misreads \'Armageddon\', and \[Ambrose\] Hansbertus and Haymo \[of Halberstadt\] \'Labadon\'. Like me, however, Andreas of Caesarea and Arethas of Cappadocia read it correctly. But Tychonius disregards \[the word\] entirely. Perhaps that was not long after the Donatists decided to mutilate Holy Scripture. Both \[Theodore\] Beza and similar innovators today delete \'the one who destroys\'. The Church of Rome recognises it and retains at as something which was added by someone who understood Latin very well. In all three languages it signifies an evil spirit which corrupts and destroys everything.

7\. There were also \'Fones\' \[deities of the woods\], or satyrs, whose leader was Faunus. \[The ancients\] used to attribute terrifying and unexpected sounds to him and, to remove these delusions, would sacrifice to Jupiter Faunus to whom a shrine was dedicated on the Aventine \[hill\]. Psellus calls them \'donkey-footed\' from the \[Greek\] form \'Onoscenes\' or \'Onoscelides\' \[she who has asses\' legs\]. (See Sozomen, \[History of the Church\] Book 8, chapter 6). Holy Scripture calls them \'shaggies\'-the Hebrew is sahirim-in Leviticus 17, verse 7 where \[Latin\] translates \[the word\] as \'evil spirits\', but the Septuagint as \'deceptive things\' or \'idols\', with the same sense. (You can find the same in 2 Chronicles 11, verse 15). Evil spirits are also called moles and bats by Isaiah, and also \'shaggies\', \'asscentaurs\', and \'vampire-spirits\', undoubtedly from the diversity of their appearances.

They are also called \'aegipanes\', that is, \'goat-footed\'. Pliny writes that creatures such as are described by poets, and their dances, were often seen on Mt Atlas. \[Pomponius\] Mela recounts what he has been told \[about them\], and Julius Scaliger confirms that they have been seen and heard in our time. In his biography of St Antony, St Athanasius says that St Antony met one of these in the desert. Plutarch in his \[Life of\] Sulla and Diodorus Siculus in his Library make mention of these same spirits\' having been seen; and, in his commentary on Genesis, Rabbi Abraham ben Ezra has many anecdotes about them, which are not worth reading.

8\. Holy Scripture also makes mention of an evil spirit in the following words: \'You will not be afraid of the terror at night, of the arrow flying during the day, of the hobgoblin walking in darkness, of the attack and the evil spirit at midday\'. Here are enumerated four perils or baneful things, all of which \[the Psalmist\] means are types of evil spirit. As the Aramaic paraphraser puts it, \'The fear of evil spirits walking in the night, the arrow of the angel of death shot during the day, death walking in darkness, and a tumultuous crowd of evil spirits going about at midday\'. I think one can count two perils or damages by human beings and two threatened by evil spirits-in the case of humans, done by overt force and cunning machinations, in the case of evil spirits \[done\] both secretly and openly, during the night and at midday especially, sometimes merely by \[causing\] fear of spectres and terrors, sometimes by an evil spirit\'s breathing forth a noxious sickness or causing some other injury.
[Page 194]

In his homily on holy baptism, St Gregory Naziazenus, of course, conjoins the terror at night and the evil spirit at midday, missing out anything in between. I also think that he puts the two damages \[caused by\] evil spirits in first and fourth place so that he can signify that the damages inflicted by human beings are not done without the help of evil spirits. As he says elsewhere, God inflicts \'what He sends\', (that is, His blows), \'by means of wicked angels\'. I know that Rabbi Salomon and others refer the last two to evil spirits, but instead of dabar, (with two kamatz), which signifies \'business, cause, thing, contrivance\', these people read it less correctly with Masoretic dots as deber by which they mean a kind of evil spirit. The word, however, signifies death or disease, (Exodus 9, verse 3), as St Jerome translates it in that verse and is followed \[in this by François Vatable. Our Vulgate is not alone in reading dabar, of course. The Septuagint also translates it as πpâyµa \[troublesome business\].

As for the evil spirit at midday, even if I like St Jerome\'s explanation that it means the palpable insults of evil spirits and, clearly, the harms they bring, I still think that what St Basil and Theodoret recorded is perfectly true-that the Psalmist spoke according to an opinion held by many and which later prevailed, and that sometimes the word refers to evil spirits at midday, which is also the meaning given in a commentary on the Psalms attributed to St Jerome. Let me say what I think about this. First, the phrase \'from the attack\' signifies a violent, fierce, overt, and savage infestation. The Hebrew word is mikketeb, that is, \'from ruin\', (as Arnobius says), \'overthrow, destruction, devastation\'.

The Greek word is oúvπtwµa, which some people translate as \'bite\', others as \'destruction\', and others as \'the ruin of those who die and fall together.

Secondly, I accept perforce the verse\'s \'from an attack and an evil spirit\' as a way of saying in common parlance \'from an attack of an evil spirit. This is how Aquila and Symmachus correctly translated the phrase. Thirdly, I think \'the evil spirit at midday\' is said for two reasons: (i) because of the place. \[Evil spirits\] were believed to live in the desert, something which meant \'midday\' to the Jews. (\'Midday\' and \'desert\' often refer to the same things in the Old Testament and so I think \'the evil spirit at midday\' and \'the evil spirit of the desert\' are one and the same). Hence, we read that the garden which contained the tomb of Jamnes and Mambres was the dwelling-place of a very large number of extremely ferocious evil spirits, (as Palladius tells us in Macarius), and we gather from Dio\'s History of Libya that the kind of evil spirit \[known as\] \'lamiae\' \[vampire-spirits\] lived in the deserts of Libya where there are still many apparitions today.

Procopius, and Cyril \[of Alexandria\] in his \[commentary\] on Isaiah, testify that evil spirits delight in living in forests and deserted places; and, according to Eusebius Preparation of the Gospel Book 5, \[chapter 6\], the oracle of Dodonian Apollo of Branchidae replied that, with the high-pitched sound of his incantation and the dreadful appearance of his body which was contorted in frenzy, Pan killed nine peasants who were cutting wood in the \'forested mountains\', údnevta xαì ойреа, and that he would have killed more had not \"Apteuis åypotépn \[Artemis of the countryside\] restrained him, (that is, a stronger evil spirit holding back a weaker).

In his book The Way Evil Spirits Operate, Psellus explains that this kind of evil spirit is connected with the sun and is therefore leonine in character, which is the appropriate characteristic for them. Raphael binds Asmodeus in the desert and releases him, and Christ our Lord is tempted in the desert. According to several \[commentators\], David calls these evil spirits \'beasts of the forest\' in Psalm 103, verse 20. Likewise, the violent wind which destroyed Job\'s house and crushed his children at the same time, (Job 1.19), came from the desert at noon, (this is \'the midday pestilence\'). It undoubtedly happened while they were having a meal, as either Origen or another author puts it very well in the Job attributed to Origen.
[Page 195]

The Hebrew word ruah means \'spirit\', (πveûua in the Septuagint), as well as \'wind\', (Aquila, áveuos), and this is correct because the evil spirit raises this wind. On this see Origen, (if he is the author of the foresaid book). \'The saints know these \[spirits\] and are mindful of them because at noon, the time of their meal, Job\'s children were seized by disaster and died. They begged God to save them from the pestilence which walks in darkness and form destruction and the evil spirit of midday, because more attempts are made by evil spirits in the darkness of the night and in the middle of the day than at any other times.\' Later on, he introduces Job as saying that that wind was not sent by God, but that the evil spirit himself had accomplished \[the destruction with a counterfeit wind: namely, \'You and a wind coming from the desert, have touched the four corners of my house\', etc. Jarrius writes that there are two evil spirits, one of which should be called \'deber\' \[pestilence\] and the other \'qeteb\' \[destruction\]. One of them goes about at midday, the other at night.

\(ii\) Therefore the midday \[evil spirit\] gets its name from the time of day because this type of evil spirit usually appears at noon and molests human beings cruelly and severely, on the one hand by spiritual temptation and strife, especially spurring them to lechery and idleness, both of which sins drive a human being strongly when he is full to bursting point with food-as Nicetas correctly says in the homily by \[Gregory\] Naziazenus which I cited, and Euthymius \[Zigabenus\] and Theodoret on the Psalms-and also by physical afflictions, which one can gather from the opinion of ancient pagans who believed that Pan, (in this case one of the evil spirits of midday), was extremely irascible and the source of a good deal of fear, as Theocritus testifies in Idyll 1, and as one gathers from historical anecdotes.

In eastern Russia, an evil spirit had the habit of roaming the countryside at noon during harvest time, dressed like a grieving widow, and would break the arms and legs of labourers unless they immediately fell flat on the ground at the sight of the apparition and worshipped it. Books also provide written testimony that frightening apparitions are accustomed to appear as often as infectious and contagious diseases or other evils of this kind arrive, as I have proved satisfactorily in my commentary on Oedipus, verses 172 and 174.

I add something which is entirely relevant to this point. In the salt-pits of Peru, behind the River Consata, an apparition of gigantic size appeared to the Indians. Its stomach had been cut open and it had been disembowelled. It was carrying two small children in its arms, made dire threats, and then vanished. The ignorant people made light of it because it appeared while the sun was shining, but a dreadful, fatal plague followed its threats, as \[Pedro\] Cieza confirms in Part 1, chapter 24 of his history of Peru.

I add another \[example\] from Procopius. He writes that it was recorded that during the widespread, extraordinary plague which depopulated the whole world at the time of Chosroe and Justinian, evil spirits looking like human beings were seen busying themselves in public and private places. They struck down those they met, and those whom they had struck down were immediately wasted by disease, (\'a particularly virulent, burning blast which is why the Jews call these evil spirits Mererim and Rhessaphim, \'deadly\' and \'burning\' or \'fiery\'\'). \[Procopius says\] this happened to some people while they were awake in broad daylight, (there you have the evil spirit at midday), and to some while they were asleep at night, (there you have the evil spirit of the night). Aristophanes\'s scholiast confuses the evil spirit at midday with Empusa, explaining that \'Empusa\' is Saluóviov ueonußpivóv \[the midday evil spirit\]. I think Empusa was also an apparition of the night, but that when she appeared at night, she was Hecate, and when she appeared at midday she was \'the evil spirit of midday\'. She would change herself into different shapes. She would become, (as Epicharmus says in The Marriage of Hebe), a twig, an ox, a viper, a stone, a fly, and a woman. Aristophanes adds a mule and an enormous monster.
[Page 196]

Others ascribe \[to her\] a single bronze leg, others an ass\'s leg or member, and from the latter she is called óvoxóxos \[\'ass\'s hoof\'\], and from the former óvokévtaupos \[ass-centaur\]. In his commentary on Isaiah, Theodoret says, \'certain ancient \[authors\] call ass-centaurs \'Eunoúoas, but the modern name for them is óvooxeríSES \[\'women with ass\'s legs\'\]\'. Aristophanes\'s scholiast agrees with this. A final point: Empusa would become anything she wanted, whatever was advantageous to her, as Epicharmus says.

This has been about the evil spirit at midday. When it comes to evil spirits of the night, there is general agreement that night is, as it were, the proper battle-ground of apparitions and evil spirits, and that this is why they are called \'princes of darkness\', and why we read that the night belongs to them and the power of darkness, (Ephesians 6.\[12\] and Luke 22. \[53\]. See Augustine on Psalm 103). Asmodeus in the story of Tobit chapter 6, \[verse 14\], is one of these nocturnal spirits, as is the exterminating angel of the Egyptians, which was the evil St Jerome talks about in \[his commentary on\] Isaiah, chapter 24, and Rupert \[of Deutz\] in his commentary on Exodus 12. (\[François\] Feu-Ardent follows them in \[his commentary\] on Ruth, chapter 3, verse 9.) Seneca said that the pestilence was seen walking about during the day, and that apparitions \'Wander through the groves in the likeness of men, \[But are\] larger than men\'.

At night, however, (the two \[spirits\] should be kept separate like this), \[there is\] the one I have been talking about: \'\[They say\] that, yes indeed, the dog has burst its chains of Taenarian iron, And is wandering through our lands\', \[Oedipus 171-173, 174-175\].

I have learned elsewhere from very many authors that most of the apparitions and terrors of evil spirits are clearly in possession of their strength at night and vanish in the morning. Psellus also says that evil spirits recognise certain people as inhabitants and lovers of darkness. The patriarch\'s Jacob\'s opponent, however, was a good angel, not an evil spirit as certain people have thought according to Procopius and a particularly headstrong, rash individual, Francesco Giorgi in Problems Relating to Holy Scripture.

Among these \[spirits\] of the night, the leader of the \'succubi\', \[evil spirits who cause nocturnal emissions is an apparition the Jews call Lilith, (from \'laila\', that is, \'night\'). This type of evil spirit is not usually dangerous to men except at night. Hence the Church, along with St Ambrose, offers a prayer against them.

\'May dreams go far away from us, And fantasies of the nights. Tread down our enemy So that our bodies may not be polluted, \[Compline hymn\].

Incubi are evil spirits which roam around during the day. The ancients made Pan their leader. The Jews call him \'Haza\'. Christians give him the far better name of \'incubus.\' In the Glossary he is called \'the incubus Пâv\' and \'Inuus\'not, I think, \[derived\] from Hebrew anas, \'to afflict, which is far-fetched, but from the Latin verb \'entering\'. The ancients, you see, thought that this evil spirit and those subject to him are on fire with a shameless love of women, not because they take pleasure in copulation, but because they delight in humans\' offending God and in the human race\'s being so loathsomely defiled. This is how one should understand Abbot Serenus in \[John\] Cassian when he says, \'Some evil spirits are more ferocious and more savage. They cannot get enough of wars and disasters, attack those who cross their path, and try to kill them by means of a cruel death\'. (This seems to be referring to the evil spirit at midday and to those about which St Matthew \[speaks\] in his Gospel, chapter 8, verse 28, and pseudo-Abdias in Book 3 of the Life of St Andrew). \'But there are others called \"fauns\" which mislead and poke fun. They haunt certain places or roads, and while they take no pleasure at all in the sufferings of those passers-by whom they have been able to deceive, they are happy to tire them out merely by mocking and jeering at them rather than doing them harm. Sometimes, too, they have sex with human beings in harmless copulations.
[Page 197]

Two things need to be noticed in this passage: (i) they take no pleasure in the sufferings of human beings must be understood comparatively, not as though it applied in all cases, and (ii) the others, who are crueller, do take pleasure \[in harming people\], because it is truer to say that absolutely all evil spirits want to inflict very serious ills upon human beings, if God allows them \[to do so\]. According to Athanasius, St Antony says that all evil spirits have an inborn hostile hatred of human beings, more particularly against Christians, and one which is especially savage against monks and virgins dedicated to God.

But they harm individuals only to the extent that God permits. If they are not prevented from going further, they take pleasure in mocking and deceiving people and in enticing them into some sin which is at least venial, such as letting their eyes wander idly, or talking to no purpose, laughing without much restraint, being distracted during prayer, and other \[sins\] of this kind into which even good people are very easily led astray. The second point about evil spirits\' copulations, which he put last, does not claim that all oppression and, as it were, stifling of this kind is produced by evil spirits, because it is agreed that sometimes it arises from that kind of melancholic illness which the Flemish call \'mare\', \[phantom\], the French \'cauchemar\', \[a phantom which presses down on one\], the Spanish \'pesadilla\', \[a small heavy weight\], Themison \'πviyahiwv\', \[\'a throttling spirit\'\], and \'ephialtes\', \[the one who jumps on you\], and is described at length by the physician Paul of Aegina. Sometimes, however, it is not an injurious disposition of the body, but an undisguised, straightforward attack by an evil spirit, as I said earlier in question 15. Now let us go on to other things.

9\. Pausanias describes for us an evil spirit \[called\] Euronymus. It has long, rather prominent teeth and a fearsome, bluish-black, cadaverous body, and wears a fox-skin. It usually feeds on dead bodies and devours them right down to their bones. To some people this seems to be a description of Death. My opinion, however, is that some apparition appeared to the ancients in some shape or other and straight away they gave it a particular name and instituted sacrifices or ceremonies of atonement to drive it away. Hence arose the following names and fairy-stories about female apparitions or portents.

10\. In the tenth spot comes the Sphinx of Thebes about whom Strabo \[wrote\] in \[The Geography of Greece\] Book 9, Apollodorus in Book 3 of his Library, Hyginus in Stories chapter 151, Natale Conti in Mythologies Book 9, chapter 8, and Giglio \[Gregorio\] Giraldi in Obscurities. If she existed, she was an evil spirit which took the form of that type of monkey called sphinges, on which read \[Johannes\] Pierius, Hieroglyphs Book 6 and Solinus, \[The Wonders of the World\], chapter 30. Secondly, \'Harpies\', on which see Hesiod\'s Theogony; Apollonius, Argonauts Book 2; the Orphic Argonautica; Apollodorus, Library Book 1; Eustachius on Odyssey Book 12; and Izacius on Lycophron. Thirdly, three \'Gorgons\', on whose form and kind I have written at length in my commentary on Seneca\'s Medea, verse 831.

Fourthly, three \'Sirens\', concerning which I made the necessary points in my Adversaria on Seneca\'s Medea. There is also a mention of these in the Latin version of Isaiah 13, verse 21. This is how the Septuagint translated \[the word\] and, according to Eusebius, so did three translators, although they did not use the same word for the Hebrew as Latin does. Theodoret thinks the Sirens were evil spirits inciting \[people\] to physical pleasure. Fifthly \'Erinyes\' or \'Eumenides\' which Latin \[writers\] called \'Poenae\' \[spirits of vengeance\]. There were three of them too. I brought together a lot of information about their appearance and nature in my commentary on Medea verses 13 ff. and verse 960.
[Page 198]

Fifthly, \'nymphs.\' Some of these are associated with air, such as the Sibyl about whom Plutarch writes in his book The Delay of Divine Vengeance. Some are associated with earth, such as the Oreads, the Napeae, the Dryads, and the Hamadryads. Some are associated with water, such as Nereids and Naiads, the former of the sea, the latter of rivers. It is agreed that all these were apparitions of evil spirits, and if it were not generally agreed, it would be proved because the sight of those enraged women would drive \[people\] out of their right mind, (which is something evil spirits do), as the scholiast to Theocritus and Hesychius, among Greek writers, tell us, and Varro and Festus among Latin writers. The Greeks call those who have been driven mad this way \'Lymphatos\', \[affected by the water goddess Lympha\], as though to say \'nymphatos\', vuuporýπtas, \[seized by nymphs\]. Those who have seen Ceres are called \'ceriti\', \[affected by Ceres\]; those who have seen a faun at midday, \'confounded\'; and those terrified people who have heard Pan and are distressed by a groundless fear, \'panic-stricken\', although this can be applied, broadly speaking, to those suffering from hydrophobia, and so on and so forth. (See what I have said in my commentary on \[Seneca\'s\] Hercules on Oeta, verse 246.)

The eleventh kind of apparition is the one with which wet-nurses usually quieten small children by striking them with fear. The main one of this type is \'Pytho\', (Lucilius, Satires \[Book\] 30). \'Acco\', \'Alphito\', and \'Mormo\' are, I think, names taken from characters in tragedy or comedy, who cause terror because of their ugliness. Theocritus and Aristophanes\'s scholiast tell us about Mormo. Acco originates in the elderly woman who drives people insane when they see her in a mirror and makes children terrified. \[Lodovico\] Ricchieri tells us about her in Book 17 of his Ancient Readings, as does the writer of Adages \[i.e. Erasmus\] under \'Accisare\'.

Plutarch gives the same information about Alphito. Next there is \'Gello\', about whom there is an adage, TEMA \[a woman over-fond of children\]. They say she was a young woman who died and that her ghost went wandering about on Lesbos and brought premature death to children. They note she was mentioned by Sappho. Another was \'Gilo\' about whom Nicephorus tells us the following while, among other things, he is talking about the things which foretold Maurice\'s becoming Emperor. \'When his mother was giving birth, she said that a strange, constantly changing, sweet smell was given off by the earth. She added-and this sounds like an old wives\' tale, and I have grave doubts about it-that very often a female called \"Empusa\", (but someone else said was \"Gilo\"), took the child out of its cradle as if she intended to eat him, but that she was unable to do him any harm at all\'. Whatever the story, however, it is more likely that this vampire witch \[strigem\] or \'lamia\' was someone who was unsuccessfully ambushing a child which was well protected by an angel. The more sensible Evagrius, (Book 5, chapter 21), added nothing about Gilo or about old wives\' tales, leaving the whole thing to the reader\'s judgement.

This was partly a bit of old women\'s nonsense, partly not nonsense but actually true. It was nonsense and out of step with reason to think that these women\'s bodies became so small that they could come through closed doors and push the bodies they had been born with through them. (See what I said in question 17.) \[But\] it was true that, with the help of an evil spirit, these wicked females were sometimes in the habit of entering the bedrooms-regardless of the fact that the size of their bodies could not change and penetrate solid objects-and once there making every effort to destroy the children. Consequently, the judge who is unwilling to be ensnared by credulity or incredulity when it comes to these matters must distinguish carefully between them, and he must examine very carefully indeed all the circumstances relating to the judgements he is going to make, because it can happen that a judge acquits the accused of one of the charges of deception which have been brought against him, although he would have been found guilty had the charge been brought in a different way. For example, suppose some vampire witch \[strix\] is accused of having entered \[somewhere\] through closed doors, having changed her body into spirit form, and thus, no longer in physical form, has killed the children. No judge will be stupid enough to believe this accusation, and if the accused denies it, there is no agreed evidence from someone other than \[the accuser\] that the children have been killed or harmed, and the accuser cannot prove his case other than by referring to the story in \[Ovid\'s\] Metamorphoses, she will undoubtedly receive a verdict of acquittal.
[Page 199]

If you read carefully the biography of Tarasius, written by the monk Ignatius, you will have no difficulty in understanding that this was the situation in the case of the women acquitted by George, (not Philip, as some people call him), the city governor, and that it was the cruelty and ignorance of Isaurus Leo which had put them in that position because, in his incredible stupidity, he believed that the women had changed themselves into spirit form.

Listen to what Ignatius says. \'Some poverty-stricken women had been accused of murdering infants at the breast by coming through a hole in the house \[walls\]⁵ or through closed doors, and killing the children before anyone realised it was happening. They were hauled into court by those who believed fairy stories\'-he is talking about the story of Gillo which had been made up by pagans in ancient times-\'and were unwilling to follow the teaching of Christ, our God, which is not in the least deceived by ghosts \[spectris\] and mental apparitions \[phantasmatibus\]. In the fairy stories told by the Greeks, you see, there is a woman called \"Gello\" who is said to have died before her time and to have come in various spectral forms to newly-born infants and killed them\'. (There\'s a fairy story for you! A dead woman came back and committed infanticide!) \'Having been enticed and deceived by the wicked spirit \[improbo spiritu\] of this story, those who were making a plausible job of saying these things tried to transfer this cursed crime to the women by saying that they had changed themselves into spirit form and that they were the reason \[the children\] were dying before their time\'.

You see the basis of the charge, Reader. They single out \[the notion\] that the dead Gello had killed the little children; it is discovered that many of them have been carried off suddenly; therefore, it is probable it was done by these women who got rid of their body\'s bulk, changed themselves into spirit form, and in this fashion inserted themselves through solid objects or thin cracks and murdered \[the children\]. Isn\'t the writer justified in exclaiming against such accusers in the following terms? \'What stupidity! What blindness of the eyes of the heart! If the body, which has been put together and moulded by length, depth, and breadth were dissolved into spirit form, and allowed to do this, then Christ, who is truth itself, says, \"A spirit does not have flesh and bones\", \[Luke 24.39\]. It is those who make this assertion who think it is a phantom, namely, \[those who have said\] that these women were not physical beings, but spirits, or had been endowed with this spiritual power of penetrating \[solid objects\].

Moreover Christ, who took real flesh and rightly told His disciples that a spirit does not have flesh and bones, will not be limited by any object He meets to being a figment of the \[passive\] imagination. Thinking along these lines, therefore, and making a judgement without much hesitation, George acquitted these women of the crimes.\' Ignatius is not sufficiently worldly-wise when he takes the \[words\] \'apparition\', \'spirit\', and \'appearance\' as referring to the same things, that is, a mental image or something which merely appears to be a physical object, and does not touch upon or deal with the crime committed by real vampire witches \[strigum\] at all. His proof has not force at all in combatting those women and what I have said about them, as those who understand the subject easily perceive at first glance.

In the third place come \'lamiae\' \[child-killers\], about whom the prophets Jeremiah and Isaiah say they were genuine stunts by devil spirits, or apparitions, as Apollonius of Tyana, St Jerome, and other Fathers \[of the Church\] have told us. I have dealt at length in my commentary on Seneca\'s Medea, verse 732 with these and \'striges\' \[vampire witches\], (which I think ancient authors in the Glossary call \'lestrigones\' because they eat human flesh); and so that it does not look as though I am going over old ground, I had very much rather you skipped this, Reader, than make me repeat myself. Lower Germany calls them \'Alven\' and \'Alvinnen\', and the Goths \[Swedes\] call them \'elves\'. St Jerome seems to mention them when he says that two and three month old \[babies\] are often killed by an evil spirit while they are feeding at their mother\'s breast. There was an ancient narrative or fancy to this effect, as Lucilius mentions, because in Book 20 he calls them \'lamiae who dwell on the earth\', and in Book 30, too, he attributes ravenousness to them with that very epithet, alluding in the following verses to their feeding on infants\' flesh: \'Because sharp-toothed Lamia and Pytho, Those wicked, absurd old gluttons, are coming.
[Page 200]

Twelfth kind. When this appears in the form of a goat, it is therefore called \'hairy\' by Isaiah and Moses, or zahir \[= sair, \'hairy\'\] by \[Solomon\] Jarrhi and \[David\] Kimchi; or a lion, which is why lions\' heads used to be nailed to pagan temples, \[a practice\] Arnobius makes fun of in Book 6 of his Against the Heathen; or a snake such as the one Asclepius brought to Rome; and as a hermit, on which see St Nilus, Prayer to God, chapters 102 and 103; or a night-owl, (see Vergil in the last Book of the Aeneid); or a fly, which is how it appeared in Laon in the cases of possession by the Devil, and how it usually appears to Anabaptists. This is why it is called Baalzebub, \'the lord of the fly\'. \[It also appears in the form\] of a pig, a wolf, or some other living creature of some kind. In almost all these forms it attacked St Antony, St Macarius, and all the other holy monks who lived in the desert.

A more recent example, (but you will scarcely find one like it), was recorded for posterity by \[Robert\] Gaguin in his History of the French. During the reign of Philippe le Bel, a lay-brother, (or \'convert\' as the French call them), from the Monastery of Vallis Sarnarii, by the name of Adam, was riding along the road very early in the morning with a serf-attendant a little before Christmas on monastery business when an enormous tree, covered in frost and rime, presented itself to him on the way, hurrying towards him as though to join its pace and bulk to his. His terrified horse jerked its head back and tried to go back the way it had come. With an immense effort Adam restrained the animal and spurred it forward. When it was quite close to the tree, the tree suddenly vanished from sight, leaving behind a dreadful smell of sulphur.

From this Adam deduced that the apparition was an evil spirit, and fell to prayer, commending himself to God. But he did not interrupt his journey. A little while later he looked back and saw that a black man, sitting on a chestnut-brown horse, was following him. \'How is it\', he said, \'wretched, damned \[creature\], that you dare attack me with these tricks of yours? Don\'t you know that my brethren back in the monastery are pouring out prayers and supplications to God for my safety? Go away and be quick about it. I have nothing in which you can be interested and possess nothing which belongs to you\'. The wicked \[spirit\] went away but, lo and behold, returned a moment or two later in the shape of a man with a long, slender neck. Adam, sick of being bothered so often, drew a sword which had been fastened to his saddle, and waved it in the air two or three times.

It split the air so quickly that it made a whistling sound. He tried to drive the apparition away, but it suddenly changed its appearance and stood where it was in the form of a man of middling height, wearing a hood on its head and a monk\'s scapular. Its eyes sparkled like steel or bronze caught in the sun\'s rays. Adam tried to stab his enemy several times, but his blows had no effect or force and merely parted the air. Then, in greater contempt and derision, the evil spirit took the form of an ass. The servant was terrified and persuaded his master to draw a circle on the ground with his sword and to make a cross with arms of equal length in the middle of it. Adam followed his advice, but the old fox did not stop. It changed its ass\'s ears into horns and in this shape, and in a most threatening manner, pretended it wanted to burst into the circle. Finally, it had had enough of the game and turned itself into a wheel which then rolled forward and attacked the monk. Carried by its continuous rolling, it crossed over the circle, leaving the monk completely unharmed, and disappeared from sight. The long sickness which followed his servant\'s terror, the long-lasting stench of Adam\'s clothes, the hoarseness of his voice and his difficulty in breathing from which he found it difficult to recover, assured people of the truth of what he and his servant had been through. So did the sudden change in his horse which, after this vision, \[ceased to be\] tame and tractable and started to be fierce, to throw its rider to the ground, and to kick out.
[Page 201]

Now let me add some less frequently found kinds of apparition.

The thirteenth kind \[is seen forming\] cohorts, battle-lines, and military encampments, because just as battle-lines of good angels appear twice in Holy Scripture, so also devils, who ape God, often show themselves to human beings in the form of soldiers in close array. In the Life of St Norbert, chapter 26, (and also in the life of St Guthlac the Hermit, in Sauer, under the month of April), one reads that evil spirits under the appearance of armed soldiers attacked a number of monks. In Trithemius\'s Chronicle of Hirsau, we read, under the year 1168, that a very large number of cavalry and infantry, drawn up in battle-lines as though going to fight, appeared near Worms to a monk \[called\] Limpugius. When the monk was dating enough to ask who they were, they replied they were not real, living soldiers, but the souls of soldiers, and that long since they had died in this very spot in the service of a certain prince.

Their uniforms, weapons, and horses, \[they said\], which had been tools of sin while they were alive were evidence of their punishment, now they were dead. Everything he saw round them was merely the fire in which they were being burned and he could help them with his prayers and supplications. Le Loyer scoffs at this monk because he was rash enough to believe that they were the souls of dead men, but his reasons and arguments against it are not convincing. \'Evil spirits pretend they are souls\', he says. Often, (but not always), \'they have produced a crashing din as they leave\'. So, too, can the spirits of the dead. \'Their clothes and weapons surrounded by flames were proof that they were evil spirits\'. The historical record does not say this, but the very things which looked like clothes and weapons and horses to the onlookers were, as far as \[the ghosts\] were concerned flames which were actually on fire. Secondly, they will \[actually\] have been flames. Didn\'t \[the ghosts\] say they were spirits who were still atoning \[for their sins\]? Thirdly, there is the verse by Vergil:

\'The care \[they take\] in looking after their sleek horses Is the same after the horses have been laid to rest in the earth\', \[Aeneid 6.654-655\].

This merely proves that evil spirits also imitate the decisions taken by God, whereby frequently \'a sinner is punished in accordance with the way in which he has sinned. This example, therefore, could be added to the preceding question about souls.

I certainly think that this story is the same as the one about something which happened in the same place, but in the year 1123, and on folio 281 \[of his chronicle\], the Abbot of Ursberg tells a story with the same general sense. I think the conclusion to this story is pertinent because \[in it\] people ask for a number of useless, over-inquisitive things, and not for prayers. Johannes Caesarius tells us that the night after the Duke of Brabant\'s army was slaughtered by the men of Liège, round about the beginning of the night, one of the Count of Loon\'s servants saw a very big tournament held by evil spirits near Montenaken, which was where the slaughter had taken place. A Spanish priest, too, while walking from one village to another at dusk near the Count\'s castle, saw an immense tournament of dead people screaming and shouting, \'Sir Walter of Milene! Sir Walter of Milene!\', this Walter being a well-known knight who had recently died. \[Caesarius\] adds that this vision quite often vanished that night and then appeared again.

Johannes Nider tells the following story. \'When the kingdom of Bohemia was being shaken by insurrection and slaughter on account of heresies, not far from the borders of the kingdom, next to a particular valley, people heard shouting at night and quite often saw presses of horsemen who were dressed in different colours. On the occasion I am describing, there were two rather bold knights in a castle not very far from the spot where these prodigies were happening. The knights wanted to know if there was any truth at all in these visions and hastily went at night to a boundary wall from which people had been accustomed to see them.
[Page 202]

But before they dared come near \[those visions\], one \[knight\] had pangs of doubt and said to the other man, \"We\'ve seen them. Let that be enough. I\'m not going anywhere near them. What\'s the old saying? \'One shouldn\'t make a joke of this kind of thing\". The other \[knight\] rebuked him for being timid, spurred his horse on, and man and horse drew near all the foresaid armed men. One \[horseman\] came out \[from the crowd\], cut off \[the knight\'s\] head, and rejoined his companions, and when the timid knight saw this, he fled and told everyone the dreadful things which had just happened. The headless body was discovered the next day, along with its head, in the valley where the armed men had been seen, but no trace of any human being or horse was found. However, certain signs and traces of something ill-omened were seen in the mud\'.

\[Nider\] adds that he was told this story, and another one, by the Archbishop of Mainz, a very hard-working man and a person worthy of being believed.

\'He told me\', (says \[Nider\]), \'the name of a soldier from the Rhine whom he knew very well, and whose son was alive at the time. This soldier had always been a prominent figure among almost all the nobles of Lower Germany because in warlike situations he was completely fearless. Because of his high-spiritedness and courage, he used to carry out serious raids and sometimes suffered them in his turn at the hands of other people. In pursuit of these \[raids\] he was in the habit of riding out-not always during the day, but also at night-to places where he would have the advantage. So on one particular night, with some hand-picked servants, he wanted to ride through a forest near the Rhine and entered it where it started.

But before he came to the end of the forest, beyond which lay a broad open space, just as people do when they fear an ambush, he sent a servant ahead to where the forest ended to see whether there was any ambush \[waiting for him\] on the open space, because \[such an ambush\] could be seen under the light of the moon and the twinkling of the stars. So when the servant peered through the branches of the trees and saw a quite extraordinary army strung together the length of the open space and approaching on horseback. When he had seen this, he reported the results of his inspection to the soldier who said, \"Let\'s stay where we are for the moment, because it\'s likely that others are following close behind as a rear-guard for this army.

We\'ll make a dash towards them, and we\'ll not be afraid of \[their\] small numbers, whether the advance troops turn out to be hostile or friendly\". Then, after a brief delay, the soldier and his men left the forest, came into the open space, and saw no one except a man sitting on a horse, following his people at a distance, and leading another horse. The soldier came towards him and asked him who he was, saying, \"Aren\'t you my cook?\" (because, from a distance, that is who he thought it was. The soldier\'s cook had died not long previously.)

\[The man\] answered, \"Yes, my lord.\"

The soldier said, \"What are you doing here, and who are the men who came before you did?\"

The dead man replied, \"My lord, those who preceded me are the nobles and knights such and such.\" (He gave many of them their own names, you see.) \"They and I have to be in Jerusalem tonight, because this is our punishment.\"

The soldier asked again, \"Why do you need the horse you are leading when there\'s no one sitting on it?\"
[Page 203]

\"It will be at your service\", came the reply, \"if you want to come to the Holy Land with me. Don\'t be alarmed. I shall bring you there and back alive, on my word as a Christian, if you heed my warnings.\"

Then the soldier said, \"I have attempted many extraordinary things in my time. I\'ll add this strange \[experience\] to them.\"

While his servants tried to persuade him not to, the soldier jumped down from his own horse, mounted the dead man\'s horse, and both riders were carried away from the servants\' eyes. The next day, however, the servants waited in accordance with their instructions, and the soldier and the dead man returned to the place where they had first met. Then the dead man said to the soldier, \"So that you don\'t think this vision was an entire fiction, I am giving you two unusual things. Keep them in memory of me.\" Then he produced a small piece of cloth made from asbestos and a little knife in a sheath. \"When the \[cloth\] is dirty\", he said, \"clean it with fire. When you draw the knife, do so carefully because if it cuts you, it will poison you.\" In this there are many things which indicate it was a vision of evil spiritsespecially the gift of the knife which would contrive the death of many people including the man to whom it had been given. (In Book 11 of his Annals, the very eminent \[Cesare\] Baronio provides another anecdote relating to the year 1004AD, which he has taken from a codex from Montecassino. I shall reproduce it in Book 6).

\[Marcin\] Kromer, a careful writer, says, \'The King of Poland, Vladislaus I, was besieging Naclum, a very well-fortified castle in Pomerania. The sentries there quite often saw lines, as it were of soldiers, in the moonlight, galloping towards the Polish camp and assaulting it from the open fields. This happened fairly frequently and so the Poles became angry and restless, and since the enemy nowhere got as far as open fighting, one night, when they were told the enemy was at hand at that very moment, they gave a great roar and charged out of their camp in a great mass and, in a fruitless attempt, pursued them as they fled in different directions. The besieged \[Pomeranians\] heard the noise the Poles were making and suddenly burst out from the fortress in a hostile charge. They worked quickly to spread \[fire\] round in several places while the few who had stayed behind in the fortress defended themselves, and easily set the siege-engines and a large part of the camp on fire. They claimed that the perpetrators were ghosts of the night who, under the appearance of a hostile army, attacked the Poles this way with God\'s permission, the particular reason being that they had violated the Lenten fast which should be observed by all Christians, and had rashly and heedlessly eaten flesh and food containing milk in defiance of the usages and ordinances of the Catholic Church.\'

He declares that these were apparitions of devils, just like the ones \[mentioned\] by St Antoninus \[of Florence\] in part 3 of his History. Within our grandfathers\' memory, they used to be known as the \'family of Hellequin\'. Guillaume d\'Auvergne told us some time ago that all instances of this kind were illusions of evil spirits. (See the last part of his Universe, chapter 24). Magicians could put on displays of many armies such as these if they could evoke evil spirits subject to their will because of a pact they have with a more important evil spirit, but one reads that God has never allowed such a militia to go beyond striking \[people with\] meaningless terrors, because if they were directed to do harm, to murder, to capture fortifications, or to attach an enemy\'s camp, no human power could resist them, as Guillaume sensibly \[observes\]. (In connection with this, I draw your attention to Olaus Magnus\'s \[account of\] engagements between the kings of the peoples of the North and the victories they have won in spite of troops of magicians and evil spirits drawn up ready for battle.
[Page 204]

The fourteenth kind. Evil spirits classified under this type of apparition show themselves in groves and other pleasant places in the form of girls or mature women dressed in white. Human beings sometimes find them in stables, along with wax tapers from which the wax has dripped down. Later on, they are usually found in the horses\' manes which they have very carefully combed and braided. Such is the well-known Russian widow who prowls about at midday. I mentioned her not long ago. So, too, are those called \'sibyls\', or \'white nymphs\', \'ladies of the night\', \'the good ladies\', and their queen Habundia. Superstitious old women think their arrival brings a great deal of prosperity and an abundance of everything to the houses they frequent, and so they lay out feasts for them in the house-plates of food and bottles of wine, all open and uncovered so that \[the spirits\] can start eating and drinking without having to wait.

This \[practice\] is clearly idolatrous, as the Bishop of Paris says in the book to which I referred, and so does Nicholas of Cusa in Book 2 of his sermons. Here I draw your attention to the three women who appeared to Machabaeus Bancho \[Banquo\] from whom the Stuart line \[is descended\] and, having appeared to him and his party while they were hunting, proclaimed he would be king. (\[Hector\] Boethius, History of Scotland Book 12). These \'good ladies\', whom the pagans called \'Parcae\' \[Fates\], and the feast prepared for them are mentioned in the life of Bishop St Germain and in St Antoninus \[of Florence\], History, title 2, paragraph 5, page 2. Those of this kind, too, \[called\] \'the deadly sisters\' or \'nymphs\', were wrongly thought to preside over wars and confer victories and were the familiars of King Hother. (See \[Olaus Magnus\], History of the North \[Book 2, chapter 10\]). The Italians called them \'Fates\' and the French \'fairies\'. The fictional Melusine, Alcine, and Morgana belong to this type. (I shall say more about these in Book 6, chapter 2, section 3, under \'remedy 1\'.)

Fifteenth kind. Through this kind of apparition God sometimes makes known future wars, plague, changes of kingly rule, and things such as that. I shall give a few examples. On the night before a rebellion by the people of Antioch, an enormous woman with a frightening expression on her face was seen lashing the air so forcefully with a whip that the whole city could hear the noise. A ghastly apparition appeared to Gennadius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, while he was approaching an altar in the church in order to beg God to keep the people safe, and when he addressed it in holy fashion it replied that as long as Gennadius was alive, it was not permitted to inflict the damage which was threatening the Church, but that once he was dead, it would attack it with great savagery. Before \[King\] Hunnericus initiated his persecution of Catholics in Africa, an immensely tall man was seen on the summit of Mt Ziquenus and heard to cry out, \'Go away! Go away!\' In Faustus\'s church, which is in Carthage, a large number of \'Aithiopians\' was seen chasing away the church\'s saints and driving them in front of them. (\[Girolamo\] Cardano, The Variety of Nature Book 14, and \[Battista\] Fregoso Book 1, under the heading \'Extraordinary Things\', give many other examples of this kind.)

In the sixteenth place one meets those apparitions which, at certain times and in certain places or houses, are in the habit of causing upsets and making nuisances of themselves in various ways. I shall not give examples of this kind because it is very well-known and one can read about them in both ancient and more recent authors: for example, the evil spirit Temesius in the passages of Strabo and Pausanias I have cited, and Aelian, Motley History Book 8.\[18\]; the black children with curly hair, St Augustine, City of God Book 22, chapter 8; \[the story\] about Datius, Bishop of Milan in St Gregory, Dialogues Book 3, chapter 4; the voices and noises heard in Marathon after the battle with the Persians, Pausanias in Attica \[= Description of Greece 1.32.4\], and before the battle of Leuctra in the temple of Hercules, Cicero, Divination \[1.34 (74)\] before the battle with the Cimbri, Pliny \[Inquiry into Nature\] Book 2, chapter 59 = 2.58 (148)\] before the Sullan civil war in Italy, Appian, The Civil War Book 1; in Antioch before the first battle of Pharsalus, Caesar, The Civil War Book 3. \[105\]; before the death of the dictator Caesar, in his own house, \[Cassius\] Dio, \[History 44.16\]. More recent \[examples\] are in \[Johannes\] Nider, The Ant-Hill, last Book; Guillaume d\'Auvergne, The Universe, chapter 24; \[Antonio de\] Torquemada, A Garden of Strange Flowers, dialogue 3; and \[Alessandro\] Alessandri, Festive Days Book 5, chapter 23. The practice of the Spanish courts confirms \[the existence of these spirits\]. \[Diego\] Covarrubias, following Portius, thought that a tenant who had no prior knowledge of it was permitted to leave the houses he had rented in the case of their being disturbed by apparitions. Disturbances of this kind are usually approved or permitted by God as a punishment for sinners, a moral encouragement to good people, or for some other reason hidden from us.
[Page 205]

Sometimes evil spirits carry out these things at the instigation of workers of harmful magic \[maleficorum\], as happened in the case of St Antony and a noble from Aquitaine who had robbed a learned Parisian of his right by force. Quite often they act of their own accord, simply in order to deceive human beings by means of some kind of false revelation or deceptive belief just, as, (so he tells us), they kept on dissuading St Augustine from being baptised. Sometimes they are content simply to harass and disturb without damaging a person physically, as in the case of the jesting spirit \[spiritus\] about whom Guillaume d\'Auvergne \[tells us\]-it used to disturb his sleep by clashing plates together and throwing stones, and would pull the mattress from underneath him and throw him out of bed-and Torquemada\'s \[spirit\] in Salamanca which used to let fly with big rocks at everyone, but whose blows were harmless and ineffectual.

Marcus the magician in Psellus\'s \[The Way Evil Spirits Operate\] says that this is the nature of underground evil spirits, and I shall deal with these in a moment. Scholars disagree, however, about the kind of pact which allows evil spirits to throw stones and do other things of this nature which seem to require hands and physical means \[to be able to do them\]. I agree with those who think that when an evil spirit is present in his own person in a particular place and has not assumed a \[physical body\], these things happen because he moves the air next to the stone by commanding and willing it \[to move\], and thus drives it forward. If, on the other hand, he were to create and assume a body, or assume that of a corpse, there would be no difficulty \[in his being able to throw a stone.

In seventeenth place let us put those apparitions from Borussia \[Prussia\] about which Jan Malecki writes in a letter. \'In Sarmatia they revere certain spirits one can see which are called \'coltri\' in Ruthenian \[Old Ukrainian\] \[and\] \'Kobold\' in German. They believe \[these spirits\] live in hidden places in the house, or in the wood-piles, and feed them sumptuously on all kinds of food because \[the spirits\] are in the habit of bringing them corn which they have stolen from other people\'s barns. When those spirits want to live somewhere and get fed, they make their desire known to the head of the household in the following way. They bring slivers of wood into the house at night and put various bits of animal dung in pails full of milk, and when the head of the household notices this and does not throw out the slivers of wood or the dung from the pails, but he and his whole household consume some of the defiled milk, then \[the spirits\] are said to appear to him and stay in his house\'.

People have the same idea about the apparitions of little men or little women with the short stature and the appearance of a pigmy or a dwarf which, in olden times, used to frequent many people\'s homes and attend to almost all the household chores, look after the horses, sweep the house, bring wood and water, and tasks such as these. Olaus Magnus \[writes\] about them. The French call them \'gobelins\', the Germans Rabbautermanneken\' and \'Gulkens\', and the Swedes \'trullas\'. Whether the \'Eros\' and \'Anteros\' who appeared to Iamblichus at his command in the form of small children while he was in his bath, I leave to you to think about.

Undoubtedly, \[however\], the mountain-dwellers of whom Georgius Agricola published an account are relevant at this point. \'They are found\', he says, \'in metal-mines and are undoubtedly fearsome or dreadful simply in the way they look. They cause trouble mainly in metal-mines and are unfriendly. Such was the Aunaberg evil spirit which killed more than twelve miners with its breath in a pit which is called \"Rosenkrantz\", and for this reason \[the pit\] was abandoned, even though it was extremely rich in silver. When \[the spirit\] appeared in the likeness of a horse with a long neck and savage eyes, it would discharge its breath through a mouth gaping wide. The \"Schneeberg\" was the same kind of \[evil spirit\] and wore a black cowl. It once lifted a miner off the ground in the Georgenthal mine and placed him, not without scraping his body raw, in a higher spot in that immense cavern which was rich in silver.
[Page 206]

A Jew in Turkey was forced to abandon a very profitable mine because of an evil spirit of the mine, which would frequently appear to people in the form of a she-goat with golden horns. Some Germans, however, like the Greeks, call those \[spirits\] which are quiet \"Kobali\" because they imitate human beings. They laugh as though they were in transports of joy, and appear to do many things even though sometimes they actually do nothing at all. Others call them \"little mountain men\", because for the most part they appear in the form of dwarfs two and a half feet tall. They look like old men and are dressed as metalminers, that is, in a vittetum, a shirt, and a piece of leather hanging round their loins. These are harmless to metal-miners, even though sometimes they exasperate miners \[by throwing\] gravel at them. But they very rarely hurt them unless they have been provoked by loud derisive laughter or cursing. They seem to work mainly in those pits in which metals are already being dug out, or there is hope that they can be dug out\'.

He describes everything correctly, although less so when he includes evil spirits in the category of \'living\' things. I know not a few ancient \[authors\] spoke this way, but I also know they imbibed this from the milk of Platonists and that they were unsure whether they were composed of a soul and a body or not. These days, because it has been satisfactorily defined for Catholics that those distinct, fully completed substances are not compounded with a soul or a body, we should avoid this way of talking, which is not circumspect enough and not accurate enough.

One must utterly condemn Paracelsus\'s error of reducing these kinds of evil spirits to types of human beings. In his Letters to the Athenians, or The Secret Philosophy, he has not been afraid constantly to assert, as though it were a perfectly reasonable axiom, that in addition to human beings, the descendants of Adam, God created four other kinds of human, endowed with flesh, bones, and reason, and put them to live in the individual elements; and that in these elements, each one of them would have his own role and provide himself with food and clothing by his own activity and endeavours. \[He says\] that those humans who live in the bowels of the earth are called \'pigmies\' and \'gnomes\'; those who live in water are called \'nymphs\' and \'undines\'; those who live in air are called \'sylphs\' and \'melusines\', and they alone have dealings with Adam\'s human posterity and give birth to their children after having sex with them; and those who live in fire are called \'vulcans\' and \'salamanders\'. So far, \[he says\], it is uncertain which kind of these humans has been given true faith in God and an open road to salvation. (\[Johann Gödelmann and others cite him as their authority for these \[ideas\]).

In a book of extracts I find that Paracelsus is represented as speaking hesitantly, but I think his Latin translator patched him up with this so that he could hide his master\'s irreligiousness, because there can be nothing more frivolous than these words of his, nothing more blasphemous, and nothing more alien from correct faith. What, therefore, will a mutilated, maimed Holy Scripture have taught us about just one kind of human being? Is our salvation therefore in doubt? Is our redemption therefore in doubt? Did the second Adam therefore not exist so that we, who died in the first, might be brought back to life in the second? If this is in doubt, don\'t the promises of the Old Testament come to nothing? Doesn\'t the message and revelation of the New \[Testament\] come to nothing? Are there really people who translate into Latin books such as these which are crammed with nonsense, lies, and blasphemies? Are there people who hammer them out and forge them and make them look beautiful? Are there really people who like being called \'Paracelsians\'? Still, let me return to the matter in hand.
[Page 207]

18\. In the final place one is presented with the apparitions of evil spirits who guard treasures. When Kavadh \[I\], King of Persia, accepted a very large treasure consisting of very precious stones, gold, and silver in the very well-fortified stronghold of Zudader which is on the boundary between India and Persia, it was being guarded by evil spirits in order to prevent all mortals from gaining access to it. When \[the King\] came with an army and tried to seize the castle by force, the evil spirits rush out and fought bravely and \[the King\] was driven back. So, he had recourse to the magic of the Jews and the Magi, but this too turned out to be fruitless. \'So\', says Kedrenos, \'he was persuaded that he could get hold of it with the help of Christians\' prayers to God, and asked the bishop of the Christians living in Persia for help. The bishop ordered the Christians to fast, pray, and take communion. He celebrated the divine mysteries, came to \[the fortress\], invoked the evil spirits who were dwelling there, drove them out, and handed the castle over to Kavadh without any problem\'. (Glykas, Annals Part 4 and Kedrenos in his biography of Anastasius.)

Such an evil spirit was the one in Basel about which I spoke earlier in question 12, and after this it came about that the guardians of treasures were said to be snakes-for example, \[those\] watching over the garden of the Hesperides and the golden fleece. After this, too, it came about that people used to add a snake made of gold to their treasures, as Ascanio Centorio says in relation to a treasure which was found near Deva, a city in Transylvania in about 1550. (See Book 4 of his Commentary on the Wars in Transylvania.)

Note, too, the story of Germanicus, a magician who went into a cave where a treasure had been hidden, while his companion stayed just out with the entrance. \[Germanicus\] saw a dog, which was entirely black, lying on the chest. Cupidity, however, drove away fear and he stepped forward a little. The earth gave way, and he was buried in the cave. (See more in question 12.) I pass over certain \[examples\] which are already well-known, such as a story the Indians tell, lying that the souls of those wives who voluntarily die at the same time as their husbands carry on being alive with them. (Pedro Cieza testified to this more than once in part 1 of his History of Peru.)

Now that we have looked at the \[various\] types of evil spirit, we could ask by what means evil spirits can be driven away and overcome, but because all wicked things done with the help of evil spirits come to a common end, I therefore thought I should discuss this point in the question about remedies against acts of harmful magic in the last Book of this work. I shall now investigate in greater detail the means whereby evil spirits are able to appear, a question St Augustine left undecided in the enchiridion \[handbook\] he addressed to Laurentius, chapter 59.

Book 2, Question 28

How can an evil spirit make itself visible to the eye of the flesh when it has no body?

It is generally agreed that he cannot do so physically unless he has assumed a body. What St Ignatius \[of Antioch\] said in his letter to the people of Smyrna is undoubtedly true-that non-physical beings cannot be seen by physical beings because non-physical beings do not have an outward appearance, or a shape, or the smallest part of any living creature which has a shape, because they are naturally constituted as something unmixed and uncompounded. It is also generally agreed that they either make a body for themselves out of the elements, or enter into and assume that of a corpse. I shall give plenty of examples of the two ways I have said one should distinguish between them, and I used the word \'physically\' because they can appear in an imagined form, once the imagination has been thrown into confusion.
[Page 208]

Book 2, Question 28, Section 1

Sometimes, then, they assume the dead body of a human being or animal and make it move. This they do, not by a motion which confers life upon it \[motu vitali\], but only by a motion restricted in its area of operation \[motu locali\], the same way they are able to stir the air. I also think that if God permits it, they can make adjustments to this body, (especially one which is not too far decayed), in such a way that they can completely deceive the sense of touch, and I see nothing out forward in argument by any learned or religious person which persuades me otherwise. Take, for example, what the Lord says in St Luke \[24.39\], where He proves He really does have a body and is not a spirit produced by the imagination: \'Handle me and see. A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have\'.

Now, this does not add much to our discussion, and certainly does not move it forward. The Lord merely wished to prove they could feel Him and come to a decision by touching Him: that their eyes were not deceiving them, because He actually did have a body which was real, since it could be touched: and that it was not merely a phantom clothed with a counterfeit body. There was no question in this case of His having assumed a body. He had flesh and bones, and by this Christ proved He was not a spirit-something the disciples believed He was because they had seen Him enter through closed doors, which a body cannot do, whether it is alive or dead: and because they could recognise simply by touch that it was a body, although \[that did not tell them\] whose body it was. He told them to use their eyes and see His hands and feet-\'see\' is the correct word, as the text indicates-and from the wounds which were still there, they were quite certain that this was the man who had been crucified three days before. Hence it is clear that the Lord\'s words are true and credible, even if we were to say that the body had been assumed by an evil spirit and could be so modified by him that the sense of touch was deceived.

Well now, here is a question. Does not an evil spirit do things every day which are far more astonishing than simulating the softness of flesh, the hardness of bones, and the warmth and gentle heat and all the other qualities associated with touch which one notices when one touches a body? I say he is able to simulate those qualities. He cannot produce real ones, those genuine vital characteristics which belong to a living body and proceed from its informing soul. Simulated characteristics, and those which approximate to the real thing, do not require an informing soul and can be constructed from the contents of the mind in such a way that they appear real to the external senses. I agree entirely with those who say that even in the corpse of someone who has died so recently that one can detect it is still warm, those properties of gentle, life-giving heat and the ability to move parts of the body are missing, and a kind of rigor has taken its place.

But I deny their conclusion that therefore a malign spirit has taken over \[such\] corpses. Grant that the substance of the body be the same in the first instance as it is in the second and grant that more of the same properties be present, in as much as the heat I mentioned still remains behind. Even so, this heat is still lacking in the corpse \[the evil spirit\] has assumed, because he counterfeits the properties I mentioned as having been left behind. The way I see it, the evil spirit is inside the corpse, counterfeiting all of them. It is easier to make a skilful counterpart than it is to create the real thing. So, it would not follow that he is unable to create a body which is still warm and provide it with those properties all by himself, and that therefore an evil; spirit cannot cleverly and ingeniously counterfeit those same properties in the corpse he has assumed in such a way as to deceive \[the sense of\] touch. Why can someone who is able to deceive the principal sense, (sight, of course), not deceive touch, the most earth-bound, the lowest, and the least spiritual of the senses?
[Page 209]

Certain people, however, have observed that these assumed bodies, such as those made from air, are cold and extremely unpleasant to the touch, such as those described by \[Alessandro\] Alessandri in Festive Days Book 2, chapter 9, and \[Girolamo\] Cardano in The Variety of Nature Book 16, chapter 93, and others. (I shall discuss these later.) From this one deduces that either the evil spirit does not want to counterfeit warmth or that God does not allow him to do so. This is the meaning of what \[Cardinal\] Cajetan says-that when someone asks about this coldness and extreme unpleasantness of the body, the evil spirit replies that he cannot do better.

In other words, God is standing in his way or at least not giving him permission. If anyone wants examples of these apparitions, he will be able to read in the last part of Guillaume d\'Auvergne\'s Universe that on one occasion \[an evil spirit\] assumed the corpse of a brute beast and deceived a soldier who thought he had possessed a beautiful young woman, only to find he was lying in the embrace of an animal\'s putrefying, stinking corpse, and I have written in more than one place about the apparition of Polycritus as a ghost which ate his son.

There is an example similar to this which Phlegon of Tralles related, but he says he relied on the testimony of an eye-witness. His story runs as follows, \[although\] I shall give it in abbreviated form. Philinnion, the daughter of Damostratos and Charito, fell in love with Machates, her father\'s guest. Her parents did not take kindly to this. She died of grief and had a public funeral. Philinnion came to \[Machates\] and, after they had talked for a long time, she had sex with him more than once that evening. They had dinner together and Machates gave her an iron ring and a gilded cup.

She, in her turn, gave him a gold ring and an enchanted pectoral. Her nurse went solicitously to make sure the guest did not lack anything and saw the girl she had nursed lying in bed with him. Delighted, she told \[Philinnion\'s\] parents and they, full of astonishment, ran \[to the room\] and, on the second day, took the two of them by surprised. With a wail, they embraced their daughter who was sleeping alongside their guest. But Philinnion looked at them grimly and said, \"Father, Mother, you were cruel to your daughter, and because of your prejudice against me I have been enjoying my Machates in my father\'s house for fully three days. Whether it was over-anxiousness on your part or lack of feeling, it will stay with you and cause you great sorrow. You will grieve all over again and bury your daughter a second time\".

She finished speaking, turned very pale, and her corpse collapsed like a dead person again-or rather, it actually was dead-and her parents, overwhelmed with grief, collapsed at the same time. The people and magistrates found out about this incident and ordered that \[Philinnion\'s\] tomb be opened. They found no body there, only the iron ring and gilded cup Machates had given her. Philinnion\'s corpse was found in the bedroom, on the bed, and because it was a monstrous portent, on the advice of Hyllos, an augur, it was thrown outwith the city bounds to be devoured by birds and wild animals. Machates himself, realising he had been deceived by an apparition and unable to bear the shame, killed himself not long afterwards.\' Phlegon tells the story at greater length and Paul, the legal expert, and Origen, relying on him as their source, use him to demonstrate \[the truth of the eclipse which occurred at the time of Christ\'s death. In the story of Nicole d\'Obry, the possessed woman of Laon, too, we read that the devil Beelzebub assumed the body of a hanged man and tried to drive the exorcist away from her.
[Page 210]

Agrippa\'s villainy was not dissimilar, (see below question 29, section I shall now what Caesarius, the monk of Heisterbach, writes about the same subject in Book 12, chapter 3 of his \[Discussion of Miracles. After the body of a dead German prince had been buried for a whole year, an evil spirit got hold of it and, as though he were giving it life, exercised control over it. (This is how one should interpret \[Caesarius\] when he writes, \'the spirit quickened the \[body\] in place of its soul\'.) \[The spirit\] could not have done this by informing it or by penetrating its essential being, but only by manifesting itself \[in the body\] and imitating \[the prince\'s\] living actions through the \[corpse\], as \[Alonso\] Tostado tells us in many passages of his \[Commentary\] on Exodus, chapter 7, question 13 and what follows. Caesarius adds similar things, (which one can read in his biography of St Patrick, the Apostle of the Irish), about someone whose body a devil inhabited for many years in the place of the man\'s soul.

At length, \[the devil\] came out of him at the command of a holy man and the body fell down and was reduced to dust. In chapter 4, too, he writes that a clerk had such a pleasant voice that \[people\] thought it was a pleasure to listen to him, until a monk came along and warned them that this was not the voice of a human being but of a devil. The monk spoke earnestly and solemnly to the evil spirit, and when it went away, the corpse fell down and stank most dreadfully. Lastly, I should refer here to the many false resurrections \[recorded\] by pagan \[writers\]. It is generally agreed that in most cases witches \[sagis\] were involved, along with a devil-whether incubus or succubus-which had clothed itself in the corpse. Consequently, in this kind of human being, too, one detects the ghastly, foetid stench of a dead body.

Book 2, Question 28, Section 2

Sometimes the Devil surrounds himself with a body made from the elements, and once it has been formed by the power he has to do such a thing, he makes it one with him, just as a lifeless body capable of being moved is united to the mover who is inside it. I doubt whether he can choose his material simply from the air, and I do not think he can condense air alone to the point where he produces a solid object. But whether he can do so or not, he usually finds it quite easy to mix together parts of air, (the element he uses most), and the earthy and aqueous parts of clouds, vapours, and exhalations, with the result that he quite easily produces colours from this mixture and quite easily condenses that \[various\] parts and makes them stick together. This is Luis de Molina\'s opinion and that of the ancients, and the argument certain people use to prove that \[evil spirits\] assume a body made simply out of the element air does not constrain me since it proves merely that they make use of the most efficacious part of air. This is why other people think that this body will never be of such a kind that someone cannot recognise it is not a real body simply by touching it. But I have shattered these arguments during the course of this investigation. I have demonstrated that what Christ our Lord said can be understood differently from what \[these people\] think.

I add that in the book of Genesis \[18.2-4\] we read that angels appeared to Abraham and he washed their feet and did not recognise \[what they were from touching them. They deceived him rather than letting him know \[who they were\]. \[People\] say the Patriarch was deceived because he had made up his mind in advance that they were men. So, my question is, why is it that anyone who thinks \[the angels\] were men has not formed in advance the opinion that they were men? Was Abraham alone less perceptive than anyone else? \[Cardinal\] Cajetan himself, on whom these people rely for support, says \[the angels\] showed something like real bones and flesh, and that these were not only visible, but palpable and solid. \'Solid\' is what he says, not \'something like a flux of air\' or \'having some kind of hardness\'. But when the devil in Caesarius Book 3, chapter 6 says that the bodies assumed by evil spirits this way have no back to them, he was lying through his teeth and making fun of the girl. What I said about \[the body\'s being made\] from some mingling of elements was known by Vergil when he wrote,
[Page 211]

\'Then the goddess \[made\] a finespun shade without strength, Which looked like Aeneas, a remarkable sight to behold, And adorned it with Trojan weapons\', etc. Aeneid 10. 636-638\].

Not made of air alone, you see, but of a cloud mixture. In The Hammer of Women who Work Harmful Magic, Jakob Sprenger tells us about vapour. He says that women have been seen in the fields with their dress pulled up, moving their body about and thrusting with their haunches, and that not long afterwards an evil spirit came into view, withdrawing himself from them in the form of a black vapour or exhalation.

Magicians from Mans, Mirabellius and his associates, who were burned in Paris, said in their judicial confession that two things were necessary for an evil spirit to assume bodies-a favourable wind and a full moon, because if the wind is against him he cannot get the body to coalesce, and if there is a waning or a new moon he cannot form a body because he has only enough material for one which is very small indeed. The bigger the moon, the bigger \[the body he can make\]. \[Pierre\] Crespet agrees with this, (The Hatred of Satan, discussion 27), but to me it seems ridiculous.

As though, (provided God does not stop him), an evil spirit cannot calm or cut off a wind and made good a failure in the moon\'s influx! That is to say, the air and the clouds belong to the murex family which has the habit of following the moon\'s waxing and imitating her waning! Dionysius of Halicarnassus tells us that the Tarquinii often saw an apparition of an evil spirit in a body made of the elements, and the ghost which appeared to Athenodorus in Pliny \[the Younger\] was of this kind, whatever Gianfrancesco Pico \[della Mirandola\] says in Book 1 of his Foreknowledge of Things.

In the case of apparitions of pagans and the damned, because they are without the Faith it was not the soul of the deceased which appeared, (except by special permission from God, and in this case, what does one say about what Athenodorus saw?), but some evil spirit \[cacodaemonum\] in its place. Such, I think, are all apparitions of spirits which take part in many, different, and useless conversations with human beings, such as those mentioned by \[Girolamo\] Cardano in connection with his father, Fazio; and, quite rightly, they all make one suspect that someone is trying to foretell the future \[sortilegii\] or has a pact with an evil spirit.

In his book on the soul, \[Philipp\] Melanchthon testifies that he had arranged conversations and disputations with several apparitions. Was this a morally acceptable thing to do, unadorned inquisitiveness, or \[the result of\] a secret pact? I make no judgement at all. I leave it without further comment. Undoubtedly the apparition of the incestuous Persian, whose corpse kept on being thrown out by the earth, was of the kind we are discussing. There is a lengthy account of it by Agathias at the end of Book 2 of his Persian War. Such, too, were the sightings of pagan apparitions such as those of Castor and Pollux at the fountain of Juturna: of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus: of Amys, the Persian: the one which appeared to Dion of Syracuse: to Curtius Rufus: to the Emperor Pertinax on the Capitol: to the Emperor Tacitus, according to Vobiscus: to Constantius and Julian, as recounted by Ammianus \[Marcellinus\]:

to Valens, according to Zozimus who also records \[an apparition\] to Serena, Stilicho\'s wife; and Petrus Thyraeus adds other examples in addition to these in Book 1, chapter 9 of his Apparitions of Spirits. Such apparitions always vanish suddenly because \[an apparition\] constructed from an elemental substance can remove itself from one\'s eyes by making itself extremely thin all of a sudden.

At this point one must make a distinction. When \[evil spirits\] appear in a real corpse, they cannot surround the corpse with a second, living body or assume any other body than the one they are wearing \[at the time\]. Physical laws are against it because, without a genuine miracle, \[the spirits\] cannot simultaneously penetrate \[more than one\] dimension relating to size. But when they appear in an elemental body, the rule is that either they cannot assume another body or corpse at all, or that they can do so, but only with very great difficulty. (I incline to the former opinion.) They are, however, able to surround a real, living body with this elemental body, and the result is that when they are clothed this way as a human being or some other living creature, \[the body\] seems to be much bigger \[than normal\]-indeed gigantic. I see no reason to prevent their doing this, because the argument that air has the ability to expand and become less solid, or to thicken and become dense, is persuasive, which is the reason Psellus gives to explain why apparitions seem to grow and shrink in such a short space of time.
[Page 212]

I find that a third kind of apparitions of evil spirits takes place, very infrequently, through certain images or statuettes, and I shall tell you what Thomas of Cantimpré said about these in Book 2 of his Universal Good, chapter 57, paragraph 21.

\'Gunerchena is a remarkable and well-known village in Brabant. Here a young man fell in love with a young girl, but when he spoke to her parents about marrying her, they refused. It was not long before the girl fell into an acute fever, and when she grew worse everyone thought she was dead. There was much lamentation, and the bells were rung as though for someone who had died. Without delay the girl\'s young lover left the village at twilight and was making his way to another \[village\] when, as he was passing some thickets, he heard a noise like that of a woman weeping. He ran to and fro, anxiously trying to find \[the source\] of the sound and discovered the girl he thought was dead.

\"Your family is mourning you because you\'re dead\", he said to her. \"Where have you come from?\"

\"Oh, a man went ahead of me and showed me the way\", she said. The young man was astonished at this, since he could see no one else except the girl, so boldly he hurried her away and immediately hid her in a house outwith the town. From here he came back to the village and spoke to his friends, then he and his friends went to the girl\'s father who was sitting by the corpse. \[The young man\] asked him if he would let him have his daughter whom he was mourning as though she were dead.

Her father was amazed and said, \"Surely to God you are not saying to me that you will raise her from the dead and take her as your wife?\"

The young man said, \"Only if you willingly swear I can have your daughter as my wife if I give her back \[to you\] alive and cured\".

Her father agreed and confirmed his promise in front of everyone. A moment later, the young man pulled aside a linen cloth which they thought was covering \[the girl\'s body\], and found a remarkable statue, the like of which could not have been made by human hands. Those who have taken a close look at devilish statues of this kind, however, say that inside the wood appears to be rotten and that the outside is wrapped in thin skin. After this the girl was brought back and restored to her father, and a few days later, now fully recovered, she took the young man as her husband and lived, safe and sound, right up to the present day. An almost similar instance is that of a man in the territory of Flanders. His sister fell ill and people thought she had died. On the day before she was to be buried, \[her brother\] found a statue in a thicket of reeds next to the sea-shore. He took \[his sister\] back to his own house, then entered the house where his friends were mourning her as if she were dead. He drew his sword, uncovered the statue, and cut it to pieces. Everyone was frightened and cried out, \"Why would you behave with such savage barbarity towards your sister\'s corpse?\" He smiled \[and said\], \"Do I look as though I am being cruel to my sister? That is not my sister\'s body, but an image \[of her\], an illusion \[created\] by evil spirits\". So saying, he took them all with him, brought them to his own house, and showed them his sister whom he had brought back. She, too, lived right up to the present day\'.

If you ask me what I think about these \[stories\], I shall say, as Albertus Magnus and \[Thomas\] of Cantimpré did, that I have my doubts. These things could be done by an evil spirit, with God\'s permission, but my opinion is that the girl\'s suitor in the first one and the young woman in the second were in league with Satan.
[Page 213]

Book 2, Question 28, Section 3

There is a popular belief that there is always something in bodies assumed by evil spirits which strikes the eye and makes one realise that this is an apparition \[created\] by an evil spirit. I can easily believe this is true, but I think that if evil spirits are not prevented by a greater power, they can appear in whatever shape they want and present it as a complete human being, excellently and very beautifully done in every respect. Such \[a form\], perhaps, showed itself to St Albert \[of Trapani\], the Carmelite, who caused it to run away by making the sign of the cross at it. (See the narrative by Giovanni Maria \[de Poluciis\] of Compostela at the start of his biography of St Albert).

But God\'s will, which is always present and uncovers irreligiousness and deceit, usually puts a stop to \[the evil spirit\], and so mortals cannot offer ignorance as a reasonable excuse. \[God\] has not yet allowed evil spirits to make use of certain forms of living creature, such as doves, young sheep or lambs. This may be because Christ, the good, true shepherd, is the true lamb, and the Holy Spirit has been accustomed to appear in the image of a dove, and because these creatures lack guile and are not in the habit of doing harm, as \[Petrus\] Thyraeus, whom I cited earlier, tells us. An evil spirit is more willing to clothe himself in the forms of creatures in which you can quite rightly find some kind of defect. He has used the form of a male or \'billy\' goat since very ancient times, and because the goat is an Egyptian deity, Moses Maimonides thinks the Jews were commanded to offer a male goat in their sacrifices, (Guide for the Perplexed \[3.46\]).

Jupiter Ammon was once worshipped in the form of a he-goat. He was called \'Ammon\' as though this was \'Chammon\', \[derived\] from Cham, the discoverer of magic. Even today, when \[people\] make an overt pact \[with an evil spirit\], they offer him a sacrifice and he appears in the form of a man. But after the pact \[has been made\] and they are supposed to worship him, he always \[appears\] in the form of a male goat, as Jean \[del Vaulx\] from Stavelot, whom I have mentioned earlier, confessed happened in his case. This is also intimated more obscurely in Dr Edelin\'s confession in \[Nicolas\] Jacquier, \[Scourge of Heretics\], chapter 4, and is given quite open expression in the summary of the sentence passed at Avignon, which I shall quote word for word in Book 5, more or less at the end of section 15.

Sometimes \[the evil spirit\] is not seen by those who are paying him homage, as \[Jacob de\] Meyer says in his Chronicle of Flanders, under the year 1459. But when \[the evil spirit\] displays himself to be worshipped, he always does this in the form of the husband of she-goats and, moreover, in the form of one which is ugly, black, and stinking. Various reasons can be given for this, one of which, of course, is that out of respect for the incarnate Word, God does not allow him to assume a human shape, and in annotation 10 of his Pneumatology, Sébastien Michaëlis thinks that one should accept the literal sense of Apocalypse 13, verse 4-that the wicked will worship a beast, that is, the Devil in the shape of a brute beast. But although, according to St Hippolytus, St Methodius, St Irenaeus, St Aretha, and others, Antichrist himself is called \'the beast\' in that passage, it is generally agreed that this is not the literal sense. It is more accurate to say that because people once worshipped the Devil in the form of a he-goat, evil spirits are therefore called \'sairim\', that is, \'hairy\' or \'shaggy\', as St Jerome sometimes translates the word. (See Leviticus chapter 13, and Isaiah chapter 13, verse 21 and chapter 34, verse 14).
[Page 214]

In Hebrew, the word \'sair\' means \'he-goat\', as hircus does in Latin, derived from \'hairs\' and \'bristle\', which may also be the derivation of the word \'satyr\'. \[David\] Kimchi confirms this in his Book of Roots when he writes that sair is a name of the Devil because he is accustomed to present himself to people\'s sight in the likeness of a he-goat. \[Sébastien Michaëlis notes that as well. In Leviticus chapter 17, verse 7 the Septuagint carelessly translated Mataíous \[meaningless\] as though it meant fatuellos \[\'buffoons\'\]. (The Longobard word matous is derived from \[the Greek\], with the omission of \[two\] letters. The French call them folletons \[\'scatter-brained\'\]others abbreviate the word to follons-because they cause laughter by laughing, stamping and jumping while they dance, and whistling while they sing, etc. and it is generally agreed that this is what the evil spirit did in the Life of St Antony, and \[see also St Thomas \[Aquinas\], first part of the second part, question 89, article 4, objection 3. I myself prefer to translate Mataíous as \'worthless\' which looks back to \'Elelim\' \[divinities\] a word for \'idols\', because in that passage sacrifice to idols is prohibited, that is, to the evil spirits who were being worshipped under the worthless guise of idols).

Another reason \[for the Devil\'s appearance as a goat\] can be given-the lust and arrogance and other vices which evil spirits are eager to imitate in their characters and actions. (\[Nicolas\] Rémy gives many examples in Book 1, chapter 24). Finally, as we read in the Life of St Radegund Book 2, written by the nun Baudomina \[Baudovinia\], her contemporary, he clothes himself as a male or female goat because perverse individuals confer upon him the leadership of goats and he is undoubtedly worshipped for the most part under this form, as \[Robert\] Gaguin proves by the example of the scholar from the Sorbonne, Edelinus \[Adelmus\], and \[Antonio de\] Torquemada by others. Rémy thinks this has been so since the very ancient times of Theseus, and I think it can be deduced from the sacred testimonies of the prophets that it was even earlier since, as I said, they call \[evil spirits\] sairim.

When \[an evil spirit\] wants to provide a symbol of close friendship and loyalty, he takes on the likeness of a cat or a dog. (\'Cat\' is what witches \[lamiarum\] assure us they are in the confessions they make every day, and Cornelius Agrippa and Simon Magus were given dogs as their familiar spirits). If someone needs to be transported somewhere, \[the spirit\] clothes himself as a horse, as Olaus Magnus tells us in the case of Hadingus, and Peter of Cluny and Hugh de Fleury in that of the Comte de Mâcon. If he is going to come through a narrow place or a crack, or fool sentries, he turns into a bat, a small mouse, or a weasel. If there are people present who are going to hamper his conversation \[with a witch\] and he wants to escape their notice, he clothes himself as a fly and occupies the space next to her ears and whispers what he wants to say.

If he wants to frighten animals or humans and throw them into confusion, in order to be able to mutilate the flock and savage it, he clothes himself as a wolf. He appeared to Pachomius as a large, raging cockerel, (\[Simeon\] Metaphrastes in Sauer, under the month of May); to St Romuald as a raven or vulture, (see Damian\'s biography of him), but to Hilarion as a little fox. \[He appeared\] to Dunstan as a dog, (see his biography in Sauer, under the month of May); to Léonard de Corbiac as a snake; to St Margaret and to Fernández Gonzalvo, Count of Castile and his army, as a serpent. If he wants to lead someone to evil under the appearance of good, he appears in the form of Christ, as he did to St Martin, (see \[Sulpicius\] Severus\'s biography); or in the form of God, as he did to the widow Theodora; or in the form of an angel, as he did to St Juliana. Finally, he takes the form which is most suited to what he intends to do, and because the human form is the most appropriate for almost all his purposes this, for the most part, is the one he counterfeits, although it is not the same every time.
[Page 215]

An old author writes \[as follows\] in his life of Abbot St Robert. \'One night the holy man saw that something malign was standing at the entrance to the choir and was, in fact, making attempts to enter, although these attempts came to nothing. It had the form of a peasant with his tunic pulled up over long bare legs. He was carrying a little basket on his back and had a piece of wood fastened to his chest with cords. He started to walk round the choir with his neck thrust forward, casting his eyes intently on the brothers to see if he could perhaps notice something in one of them which would be pleasing to him. The \[holy\] man, however, started praying more earnestly to God and rousing the brothers from their listlessness, and the impudent spy was kept waiting for a long time to no avail. When he saw he was achieving nothing, he grew angry and took himself off to the lay-brothers\' choir. There he also observed everyone inquisitively.

If he saw they were drowsy, he laughed and rejected them; if they were occupied with harmful thoughts, he broke into applause and started dancing in an extraordinary fashion. At length, he found a young man among the novices, whose mind was wandering off towards forbidden things. He was present only in body and, indeed, having secret thoughts about running away. Noting, therefore, that this man had captured his interest, the peasant\] seized hold of him with a small three-pronged fork, thrust him into his little basket, and quickly rushed away from there. The holy man noticed this and was very anxious and concerned for the young man\'s salvation. In the morning he made diligent inquiry after him, but the youth with his wandering thoughts had fled before dawn, shaken off Christ\'s gentle yoke, and followed His enemy.

He joined a band of criminals, took to thieving, and not long afterwards was arrested and executed, ending his life in a most wretched fashion\'. An evil spirit with crisply curled hair appeared to St Robert during a wedding procession, busying about with an insolent expression on its face. (See Sauer, Volume 3, under 7th June.) It appeared to Maximus of Rhegium as a ship recently landed, with its crew; to Evagrius as an heretical clerk, and to Macarius on one occasion as a reaper, and on another as a druggist; to Nathanael on one occasion as a driver riding a donkey, and on another as his servant, Jorarius, as Marulus and Sabellicus, from among the older writers, testify. It appeared to Apelles as a beautiful, long-haired, seductive woman, but he was sensible enough to drive it away with a glittering sword which he turned on it.

But however much \[an evil spirit\] wants to present itself in the likeness of a human being, which is a privilege belonging to God, he usually does so only in the form and manner which God permits, as St \[John\] Chrysostom bears witness in homily 4 on Lazarus. Consequently, we see that either \[the spirit\] does this unwillingly, since those who are not too stupid to do so can always recognise the deceit if they pay attention, or evil spirits reveal themselves in a human body which is black, filthy, stiff with dirt, stinking, hideous, and frightful-or at least with a grim, ill-omened, horrible expression on their face. Their nostrils will either be misshapen, like those of monkeys, or excessively dark; their mouth will gape open wide; their eyes will be deep-set and the colour of flame; their hands and feet hooked and vulture-like; their arms and legs lank and very hairy; and their shins like those of a goat or a donkey. One foot, or both, will be cleft and hard as horn. Sometimes the hoof will be solid; sometimes one foot or both will be maimed. Their physical stature will never be the way it should. One will always be able to note something unusual about it, and the deformity and crookedness which reveal the evil spirit underneath. Some people prove these points by means of ancient and more recent examples, and I have already told you many of these.
[Page 216]

\[The evil spirit\] is certainly in the habit of appearing to the dying under an extremely frightening aspect as, according to Severus Sulpicius, he did to St Martin, and to a well-known Florentine to whom he appeared, pouring forth a huge flame from his mouth and sulphurous smoke from his nostrils, (see Blaise Melanesius\'s life of St Giovanni Gualberto,) and similarly to St Odilo, (according to Sauer in the biography of the saint, under ist January.), To St Opportuna he appeared raging in the likeness of a very black \'Aithiopian\', with his hair and beard dripping as though \[made\] of hot, flowing pitch, and with eyes like glowing red-hot iron, \[promising\] tortures, (Bishop Adelelinus in his biography of her in Sauer, under the month of April). An angel gave an explanation of this to St Aichadrus. It is permitted by God, \[he said\], so that the very terror of such a frightening vision can purge saintly people \[of their sins\], if there is anything left in need of purging in them. (See what Fullelus writes in his biography of Aichadrus in Sauer, under the month of September).

The whole of antiquity testifies that \[evil spirits\] could and were accustomed to speak in a body which they had assumed, and \[antiquity\] records the oracles they poured out from speaking caves, oaks, and statues. (I have dealt with these elsewhere). To this type also belong the skulls or heads of dead pagans in which evil spirits spoke, such as the head of Polycritus\'s son, about which Phlegon \[wrote\], taking his story from Hieron of Alexandria; the head of PubliusPhlegon again, from Antisthenes; the head of Gabinius, described by Pliny the Elder; the skull of a magician, about which \[Gianfrancesco\] Pico \[della Mirandola\] tells us, and that of another magician, on which see Melchior Flavinus, the Minorite.

One should be aware that Nature has rejected all actions of evil spirits which relate to the business of a living thing because, strictly speaking, they have no body and therefore should not be thought, any more than angels, as really eating or drinking a physical drink or any physical food; and to have doubts about this-as Origen seems to do in his third dialogue which deals with the human side of Christ-does not, in my opinion, accord either with natural philosophy or Catholicism, but follows the madness of more recent Rabbis. All natural philosophers know it does not accord with natural philosophy, and \[Alonso\] Tostado proves this most convincingly in question 11 of his \[commentary\] on Exodus, chapter 7. Holy Scripture confirms it is not Catholic in Tobit 12, verse 23.

That it is a rabbinical \[idea\] is clear from the Avot of \[Rabbi\] Nathan where the madman writes that evil spirits have three things in common with human beings-they eat and drink, they have sex and beget offspring, and they are subject to death. Who doesn\'t smile that these ideas are being stuffed into people today by a Calvinist to whom the Book of Tobit is not part of Holy Scripture? So as speaking is an action connected with a living being, it follows that when evil spirits are seen to speak, they are not actually speaking by means of an action connected with a living being but, as \[Nicephorus\] Gregoras notes, by producing a sound in the air similar to the human voice, which sounds like \[a voice\] to the ears of bystanders, almost the way someone skilfully expresses the sound of a human voice by means of some instrument such as a pipe or trumpet: or the way hollow valleys catch hold of a voice and throw it back very distinctly: or air-organs separate sound into various accents and tones by the numerical arrangement of \[teeth\] on a comb \[like that used to crisp the hair\].

(Please read \[Alonso\] Tostado, op.cit. chapter 7, question 15). For the most part \[evil spirits\] make use of someone\'s regional accent, as Psellus recorded. Butand you should note this, because from it you can recognise their deceit-they use a voice which grates and hisses, is difficult to understand, and is feeble and very indistinct, as though it were coming out of a large jar or through a cracked pot. Very many of the confessions made by witches \[sagarum\] say this, according to \[Nicolas\] Rémy.
[Page 217]

But when a devil appears in an assumed body, he can be seen, and when he speaks, he can be heard, only by those he wants \[to see and hear him\]. He remains hidden from everyone else, and that is in accordance with his character. If, of course, in the case of some people and not others, he causes some impediment in the instrument or object, and if he impedes the medium in such a way that it cannot bring visions to the eye or make them heard: or if he stops the images themselves: or wants to hide the people he carries off in a trance, he allows images and sounds to pass freely to and fro and abducts people\'s imagination so that they think of nothing else.

Final Section

Finally, it is in no way licit to get evil spirits to appear to us, or to bring images of the souls of the dead before us, (something they cannot actually do), and in fact \[trying to do so\] is a mortal sin. St Augustine and St Thomas \[Aquinas\] tell us that we cannot summon evil spirits as allies, and all familiar intercourse with them is strictly forbidden. The Apostle \[Paul\] is against our \'becoming allies of evil spirits\', Corinthians 10.20\]. To ask and beg something of them in friendly fashion, or to receive something likewise, is to take oneself off into the Enemy\'s camp and desert the Church of Christ. We cannot compel \[evil spirits\] by giving them a command and making them obey it, unless we have to some extent been delegated by God to do this by \[holding\] the office of exorcist, during the exercise of which we are making use of God\'s authority. Finally, even if it were allowed, it would be a stupid thing to do because one can expect nothing good or advantageous from an evil spirit. He confers nothing good at all on human beings, unless \[the good\] is mingled with a greater evil. He tells us nothing unless in answer to mere inquisitiveness and worthless \[questions\]. He does not obey unless it is so that he can destroy and bring under his dreadful despotic rule those who have been swept away by everlasting ruin.

As a result of these apparitions of evil spirits, someone could raise the question, why did they appear in visible form so frequently to our ancestors, but do not do so to us these days in similar fashion? St John of Bridlington once asked St William of Sleightholme this question, and St William replied, \'Our old ancestors\' minds were not illumined by deceptive splendour and worthless glory, but by divine grace, and so they easily saw through the lying tricks and machinations of the Enemy.

Like undefeated boxers they fought him bravely. The arrogant \[spirit\] did not put up with this, of course, and began to throw in their way temptations which were very difficult to struggle against, and present them with monstrous shapes, and make really appalling attacks on them, in order to thrust them into sin by force. But us, who easily obey him, he easily floors with the darts of secret temptations, even if he does not show us any loathsome image\'. (Thus far, a writer of that time, in Sauer, under 10th October). I add that God permitted it at that time because there was less inquisitiveness in those days and people were in less danger of being deluded.

Book 2, Question 29

Can the Devil really make a human being rise from the dead?

In \[Diogenes\] Laertius, \[Lives of the Eminent Philosophers\] Book 8, Empedocles and the rest of the magicians concede that there are certain herbs with the power to bring a dead person back to life. The historian Xanthus says that one Tillo and a snake were brought back to life by the herb Balis, and Juba tells us that someone was resuscitated by an Arabian herb. The arch-magician of our time \[Agrippa\], however, says that an evil spirit cannot do this in the case of a human being, \[although\] he can in the case of any other living creature. Drowned flies can be brought back to life naturally if they are put in warm ashes, and so can bees if they are sprinkled with catnip juice. Eels which have died because of a lack of water \[revive\] if they are thrown whole into vinegar which has vulture\'s blood mixed in with it and are then stored away under thyme. Within a few days they all come back to life. The pelican calls its chicks back to life with its own blood; a dead lion cub, too, is resuscitated by its parent\'s voice and breath; and a weasel can do the same for its pups. (I know many eminent ancient authors are in agreement about the pelican and the lion). Indians call a small bird which has been resuscitated \'vicicilinus\' because they think it dies in the winter and comes back to life in spring, (see Francisco Gomara, History of Mexico, chapter 23), but their mistake is pardonable.
[Page 218]

\(1\) I think that living creatures which are born from putrefying matter can, once they are dead, be revived by an evil spirit using natural remedies. This is because he knows the power contained in the heat produced by putrefaction, and everything else which is necessary for his purpose. One should note, however, that this living creature will not be exactly the same \[as it was before\] because, although its basic matter can still be the same, provided it has not yet decayed, the soul which will be produced afresh by \[the spirit\'s\] power will not be exactly the same as the one \[the creature\] had before it perished. God alone has the prerogative of being able to reproduce exactly something which has perished, and I think this opinion-which is that of everyone except \[Duns\] Scotus, who does not agree-is fairly accurate. Scotus and Richardus \[Rufus of Cornwall\] think that this can also sometimes happen through natural causes. On the other hand, Durandus \[of Saint-Pourçain and Marsilius \[of Padua\] think that God cannot do this.

More recent writers refute Scotus, and quite rightly so since, according to Aristotle, Natural Philosophy Book 5 and The Generation of Living Things 2, and St Dionysius, The Names of God, chapter 6, one cannot come back from a state of not-having to a state of having. Ambrose, Lactantius, and other Fathers \[of the Church\] always speak about this in terms of its being a genuine miracle. \[Domingo de\] Soto, \[Fausto\] Socini, and Francisco Suárez, and others I have cited, rebut Durandus at such length and so forcefully that anyone who still tries to defend him certainly cannot escape the reputation of being obstinate and having ill-considered opinions.

Hence, I further deduce that, since resurrection requires that what is rising again be exactly the same as it was before both in regard to their form and their matter, and at the very least their specific combination, only a human being can properly be said to rise again since, because he is immortal, only a human being\'s form remains the same. If any other living creatures are brought back to life, it is incorrect to say they have been resuscitated. Therefore, (to put it simply), Satan will not even be able to restore insects to life.

\(2\) I think \[an evil spirit\] cannot, in the way of Nature, restore to life more perfect living things and things not born from putrefaction because \[creatures\] which are more perfect require particular arrangements \[of their basic matter and a rather careful preparation of their individual organs, since these cannot be created except by the power naturally inherent in semen. This is acknowledged, in the Life of St Silvester by Simeon Metaphrastes, by Zambre, a Jewish magician, who had killed a bull by whispering words in its ear and could not bring it back to life again except with God\'s \[assistance\]. So if it happens that such creatures have sometimes been seen to revive, they have not been entirely dead, but simply looked as though they were, as in the case of living things which lie motionless for part of the year and seem to be dead, and then rouse themselves once spring arrives and appear to have come back to life-dormice, for example, and bears, and the vituline sparrow, (i.e. the \'vicecilinus\' in Mexico), as \[Girolamo\] Cardano tells us.

\(3\) I think an evil spirit cannot make the soul of one brute beast animate the body of another. This is because individual souls of this kind, produced from the potentiality inherent in matter, die if you separate them from their own \[basic\] matter. But what happens in the case of humans?

\(4\) I think that an evil spirit has very little or no power to effect \[such a thing\]. My explanation is this. He cannot make a person rise from the dead, nor can he make a human being\'s soul enter its body and bring it to life and inform it.
[Page 219]

This part of my conclusion has to be taken on trust. It rests upon natural philosophy which explains that nothing can return to its natural condition after it has suffered a complete, total deprivation \[of life\]. Therefore, if such a thing happens it is a miracle and comes from God alone. The evil spirit cannot inform that body, because he himself is a perfect, complete substance, and putting together another substance as a part \[of something else\] is incompatible with his \[capabilities\]. I prove that an evil spirit cannot reintroduce to the body a soul which has been separated from it so that \[the body\] can inform the soul, because there is only one natural way of joining a soul and a body, and that is by begetting and creating the body and pouring a soul into it. In the case we are discussing, however, the body is not begotten and therefore in this case the natural way of joining \[soul and body\] does not exist; and the supernatural way of the kind which takes place in a resurrection belongs to God alone. If God were to give His permission, an evil spirit could force a damned soul to enter a body in order to give it movement and let people see it performing some actions, because he himself can enter it and could, by means of torture, compel an unwilling soul to do this.

Magicians, too, with the help of evil spirits of a higher rank, (because of their mutual pact), can compel evil spirits of lower rank to enter a corpse, wear it, move it, and do everything else for the time being which make it seem to be alive. Cornelius Agrippa did this in Leuven. He used to have an inquisitive member of his household and on one occasion, when Agrippa went on a journey and left the keys of his library with his wife, (whom he later divorced), with the instruction that she was not to let anyone enter it, this ill-considered young man kept badgering the poor woman in and out of season until he succeeded in getting from her the means of entering \[the library\]. He went in, came across a small book of invocations, and read it.

Well now, lo and behold he was disturbed by a knocking at the door! He continued reading. Someone knocked again. The young man, who was inexperienced in these things, did not answer at all and an evil spirit came in. \'Why have you summoned me?\' it asked. \'What are your instructions?\' Fear stopped the young man from speaking. The evil spirit blocked his throat, and thus the wretched \[youth\] paid the price of his wicked curiosity. Meanwhile the arch-magician returned to the house and saw evil spirits jumping about all over it. He made use of his customary magic, and they answered his summons and told him what had happened. He ordered them to enter the corpse of a murderer and go for a walk every so often in the market-place, (where the rest of his students were accustomed to meet quite frequently), and leave the corpse there. The body walked there three or four times and then fell down as the \[spirit\] which was directing it left it. For a long time, people believed the corpse fell down because \[the man\] had died all of a sudden, but the signs of suffocation started to give rise to suspicion, and later on time revealed everything and Agrippa fled to Lotharingia and began to spew out the heresies had had been concealing.

Book 2, Question 29, Section 2

We are presented with many stories about those resuscitated by the power of Aesculapius-Tyndareus Glaucus, Admetus, and so forth-not only by pagan poets, but also by weightier writers. Plato tells a story about Er, Pliny about Gabienus and others, Apuleius about Zaclas the Egyptian, Philostratus (Book 4) about those resuscitated by Apollonius \[of Tyana\], Clemens and Hegesippus about those resuscitated by Simon Magus, and Prochorus, in his apocryphal \[Acts of John\] about others \[resuscitated\] by the magician Numadius. There is an extraordinary story in Plutarch who tells us that Enarchus was left for dead by his doctors and was seen not long afterwards to come back to life. He said he really had risen again from the dead and that the evil spirits which had taken him away from life had been severely reprimanded by their prince because they had carried him off instead of Nicandas, a tanner, who had been seized by fever the same day and hour while lying in bed and had died of his illness.
[Page 220]

Not content with this, in order to prove he had come back from the dead, he predicted to Plutarch, who was not well at the time, that he would soon be fully recovered-and that is how things turned out. Ranulf \[Higden\], the author of Polychronicon, tells us that one night Earl Richard went into a church all by himself to offer a prayer, and there found a bier on which a corpse had been laid out. \'All of a sudden, while the Earl was praying, the dead man jumped off the bier with a loud cry and came towards the Earl with his arms outstretched, as though to knock him down in his embrace. The Earl made the sign of the cross on his own forehead and somewhat forcefully adjured \[the dead man\] to go away. This he did not do, so \[the Earl\] drew his sword and cut him down, and thereafter gave instructions that watch was to be kept over corpses throughout the whole region\'.

More extraordinary than either of these \[stories\] is one told by \[Robert\] Gaguin in his description of Muscovy, and I shall now add it \[to my account\]. \'Certain people living in Lucomorye, a province of Russia\', he writes, \'die every year on 27th November, as swallows and frogs are in the habit of doing, before the cold of winter sets in. Then, when spring returns, on 24th April, they come back to life again\'. He adds, \'When these people sense that death is near, they put goods they want to sell in certain places and their neighbours, the Grustintzi and Serponovtzi, take them away, leaving behind in the same spot payment of equivalent value. When the people of Lucomorye come back to life, they take this payment if they think it fair. If they do not, they ask for their goods back. It is said that this is why quarrels and wars very frequently arise between them\'. Sigismund \[von Herberstein\] tells the same story, but \[Cesare\] Baronio thinks it is a fairytale, (see his book on Muscovy, folio 86).

Consequently, I must briefly reply to all these and similar examples by saying that evil spirits usually \[create\] many illusions in connection with this kind of \[phenomenon\]. Sometimes \[a spirit\] steals the bodies of the dead and substitutes others made from air which move as though they belonged to living people. We know from Livy that \[a spirit\] removed Romulus\'s body this way, and we know \[about\] Cleomedes\'s \[body\], and that of Alcmene which \[spirits\] fashioned and gave to Rhadamanthus as his wife. We also know from Plutarch and Herodotus about Aristeas of Proconnesus, and from Antoninus Liberalis about the virgins Aspalis and Cresylla. Likewise, \[a spirit\] substituted other people for Glaucus, Tyndareus, Er, and others, or her himself secretly entered their skins.

Sometimes, in order to make things which are actually corpses come to life, he secretly goes into them and, like a sailor making a ship move, he makes them move and forces them to act as though they were alive and imitate the gestures \[of living people\]. Now, because people raise objections, at this point I must refer you to what was done by Simon Magus, to what happened in the case of Earl Richard, and to what happened in the case of Er of Pamphylia or Armenia, (unless that instance was actually made up by Plato in order to frighten people away from wrong-doing by making them afraid of the underworld, which is what \[pseudo-\]Justin Martyr thought in his Exhortation).

There are also the cases of Gabinius, Polycritus, and Publius whose heads predicted the future, and the example from Apuleius about Socrates whose head was cut off by a female inn-keeper who was also an aged sorceress \[veratrix\]. Having cut it off, she joined it to the body again by sticking a sponge \[under the cut\]; but next day, when the unfortunate man, contrary to her instruction, drank from a river, the sponge fell out and he lost his head because it really had been cut off and its restoration was counterfeit, \[Metamorphoses 1.16-18\]. Relevant here is the story I told about Agrippa\'s boarder, three others which \[Nicolas\] Rémy tells in Book 2, chapter 1 of The Worship of Evil Spirits, and one told by Philostratus in Heroic Deeds dialogue 1. \[18\] about Phrygian shepherds.
[Page 221]

When their cattle were being killed by murrain, they gathered at the tomb of Ajax, son of Telamon, in Sigeum, and heaped various curses on the dead man. One \[shepherd\], more forward than the rest, began to recite verses from Homer in which Ajax is described as running away-\'Aïas δ\' oùxéti µíuvev\' \[Ajax stayed no longer, Iliad 14.727\]-and a voice burst fiercely from the tomb, \"AMou \"piliov\' \[But I did stay\], and the shepherds, thoroughly frightened, took to their heels. The origin of the voice, you see, was an evil spirit. Finally, also relevant here is the story about a German youth which I shall tell in the next question, which would be remarkable but for the fact that he pretended to be killed, even though he had not been killed, but had simply fainted away and then thought he was decapitated. Everyone else thought the same, since their eyes had been blinded, but his head had not been cut off, nor had it been restored. It was all a conjuring-trick.

At this point, let me add one example of a fictitious resurrection. Antiquity had produced no story more convincing or more wonderful than this one. It took place in Dalheim in Lotharingia in 1581, and involved Petronius, a herdsman, and Abrahel, a succuba. In his summary of Book 2, that remarkable man, Nicolas Rémy, had shown most picturesquely and in very elegant verse, how Abrahel seduced Petronius into criminal embraces, then into the murder of his own small son, and finally, because of his grief and despair and a false resurrection of his child, into idolatry: and how the evil spirit presented him with a likeness of the living \[child\] for a whole year and then abandoned it as a corpse. I shall transcribe this with greater pleasure than equanimity because, as the result of the insupportably bad practice of its recent printer, the verses in \[Rémy\'s\] Worship of Evil Spirits have been removed and the work published in mutilated form. \[Thus\] they will be preserved unharmed, and in consequence will be read in more places.

\'There is a country in the middle of the bounds of an enormous kingdom Between the winding streams of the sandy Moselle And the straight courses of the Saar with its undisturbed river-bank. There is a village here called Delheim-not a well-known nameAnd while a herdsman was grazing his flock in a distant valley there And pondering the various cares which were rolling around in his heart, Perhaps sick of the unfairness attendant on his straitened circumstances, Or contemplating, with a degree of passion, revenge and anger Because of a loss he had suffered, or high words exchanged in a quarrel, A succuba presented herself quite unexpectedly.

She was most seductive. Her face had a maidenly expression, her gestures were charming, Her head was decked with false sapphires, And \[her hair\] was twisted into glistening curls on each side \[of her face\]. She comforted the unhappy man and gave him hope of becoming master of his situation, And promised him the wealth which the needy have so often prayed for in vain, Or which the long-eared king \[Midas\] was willing to demand of Iacchus \[Dionysus\] As long as he did not object to what he was saying. Just as when a fire which is quickened by a pair of bellows Licks the iron while the puffing renders \[the metal\] ductile, So that the hard \[substance\] is persuaded to be compliant And is prepared \[to receive\] all its instructions, And does not disregard the arts of persuasion: \[The herdsman\] is happy to submit to \[the succuba\'s\] alluring command, And on both sides trust is strengthened by a \[mutual\] pact. He made his way into her dreadful embraces. Their unequal love was cemented by senseless coition. Irreparable, freedom Died at once amid those unspeakable passions. And, just as the parts of a body wounded by the dangerous bite of snakes Spread the consequent poison throughout the whole body, So that health itself cannot provide what health requires, Even if it spreads itself as far as it can, So Abrahel took over her lover entirely.
[Page 222]

And broke him by filthiness-this very wicked woman had designated it thus so that she could bend the vanquished man to any of her stipulations, and he could have absolutely no will \[of his own\] to say yes or no. Straight away and without hesitation she demanded an initial recompense for her violated virtue. \'Play your part\', she said, \'so that your love May be the equal of mine\'. There could be no greater proof of this Than if he conquered Nature and carried out a crime Any by this fresh deed subordinated a father\'s love to his passion. Therefore, since it was already late, he drove his whole flock Into the sheep-folds and finally settled himself in his little house.

First, so that his dear son would put his weak arms round his neck To support himself \[to receive his father\'s\] kisses, he drew out of his bagWhich his son was keen to search, although he had often found it empty When \[his father\] came back from the countryside-an apple and held it out to him. \[The boy\] had scarcely taken his first bite, grinding his teeth because he did not like the sour taste, Than he turned pale and sucked it hesitatingly with the tips of his lips, And lay stretched out on the ground which fell away behind him. If \[his father\] could look at this with equanimity While carrying out his orders with this pledge, It would be strong evidence that his was still cleaving to his new love.

Such an unspeakable crime horrified him to begin with And Nature and passion fought each other in a battle whose outcome was uncertain. But he who introduced a powerful enemy into an empty citadel Hesitated in vain to carry out his instructions, because if he did nothing in response to her first command when she entreated him seductively, The insolent woman immediately passed to violent anger And her will, ever present, was like statute law to him. Now the evening which was obliged to be privy to so great a crime Had brought back to the threshold of his cottage the father entangled in these dreadful things. When his son met him and spontaneously greeted him with a big hug as usual, He groaned, and shifted from foot to foot, and stammered. Yet this did not stop him at all from \[fulfilling\] his wicked promises.

The cruel man Dared to continue to reach for the deadly gifts of murder. Let his son be the victim of an abominable love! His father did not shrink from slaughtering him with his own hand. Straight away Nature, which had allowed herself to be concealed And had withdrawn because of his feigned excuses, came out more ardently and rose up powerfully with grief; And while \[this grief\] fed on the feeble advantages \[he had wanted to gain\] And his ill-considered weeping, the woman stood nearby to give him her advice. The moment he killed \[the boy\], she consoled him And, at the same time, promised to restore \[the boy\] to life and make him live again, If \[the father\] would willingly worship her and, as a suppliant, beg this of her; And he, who had \[morally\] bankrupted himself earlier, Readily agreed to this turn of events, for which he would pay an extremely heavy rate of interest.

And while the fickle man wanted to appease, in any way he could, The gods of his household whom he had dishonoured by the foul murder of his son, He disgraced them even more and polluted them more repulsively Because first of all he threw himself on his knees before the evil spirit And worshipped it forthwith as a divinity. Then he promised the boy to her as payment, If only, with her help, his last-born child could feed himself upon life-giving air once more, \[Begging her\] just as when winds join battle and cast themselves An angry sea, and a sailor trembles in every limb quite uncertain of his life, and is lavish in his pleas to all the gods, And tires them out with his prayers.
[Page 223]

The corpse lay on its back on the mound where it had been thrown When life had finally fled and abandoned it, And its mother, very late in the day, began to make haste to bury it. But look! \[The child\'s\] body seemed to stir itself between her hands as she touched him And gradually once again to overcome \[death\] with \[living\] heat. The kind of light those who are half-alive, half-dead show in their downcast eyes, Or which, with difficulty, releases those who have been plunged deep in sleepThese signs of health restored, beyond what people hope, Seize them and give them joy, and with as much eagerness as they can The vigorously warm the powerless limbs And recall now the arms, now the legs, to their living functions.

The boy rose to his feet straight away, then Took a step, can called to his parents in the voice they knew well; Only he was different in appearance from \[the boy\] he had once been, Because he had a face \[rendered\] ugly because the skin was drawn tight over it, And because a gloomy stupidity was in possession of his receding eyes. A foreign life, therefore, quickened the senses which had been deserted And in this apparition restored the breath which had once been there, (As Virbius once obtained the light \[of life\] which had been cut off from him). But the mind was not the same, and the breath Which used to warm his life did not now exercise that same office. An evil spirit provided the mechanism to drive the sluggish bulk, Give it the appearance of life, and imitate the actions of \[human\] behaviour, Breathing \[into it the actions\] which Nature used to carry out for herself. At length, the moment a year had run its whole course And completed its circuit of the dense globe, \[The evil spirit\] abandoned its stopping-place and left the dwelling empty.

It betrayed its flight by a sulphurous smell and a noisy din, And pushed itself out, bursting forth into stinking gusts of air. Then the corpse fell down, thrust away by this second death. There followed a foetid stench and \[the body became\] very heavy. A kind of numbness \[caused by\] unhindered emotion covered the motionless \[child\] Completely with earth, and cut off the widespread strength of the stench So that it could not gain entrance to human nostrils. \[The body\] was carried away from the house by a hook firmly attached to it, And the dishonoured remains were laid under a clean sod cut from the earth, While the father, who had been mad enough to shame Nature this way With his disgraceful act, shuddered at what he had done\'.

Finally, (1) \[The evil spirit\] fashions dead people who are not actually dead, and for this purpose makes use of the not infrequent convenience of natural illnesses known as ¿φóvous \[undead\], as in the case of the apoplectic, the planet struck, or the thunder-struck. These people\'s brain is very badly impaired at the point where all the nerves begin, and this damages feeling and movement in every part of the body; and so, because feeling and movement are impaired this way, \[the people\] fall down and lie as though they were dead.

\(2\) If their xapâ \[brains\] are attacked in the case of the head\'s being beaten, as it were, by a debilitating fever, the humours injure the brain in such a way that the consequence is a stupor and immobility of the whole body; and when deep sleep accompanies this, the human lies with closed eyes, looking like a dead person, sometimes for a very long time, as though he \[actually\] were dead.

\(3\) In the case of those who are afflicted by \[swooning\], that is, a syncope or collapse of the soul, this illness sometimes adds to \[the symptoms\] I have mentioned a disturbance of the artery and a lack of pulse. This affliction makes the human being very much like someone who really is dead and lasts until the excess and attack of cold humours is dissipated. According to \[Paolo\] Giovio, John Duns Scotus suffered from this kind of illness and was buried alive as though he were dead. I should think the Euarchus mentioned by Plutarch was suffering from an illness of this sort, and that the prediction which came from human foresight and medical judgement could not have had any importance.
[Page 224]

\(4\) In the case of women who are putting up with suffocation of the matrix and suffering from jaundice, sometimes what they are suffering makes them lie as if they were dead. Such, we understand from Philostratus, and Eusebius\'s book against Hierocles, was the girl \[resurrected\] by Apollonius \[of Tyana\], and such, too, the girl \[resurrected\] by Heraclides \[of Pontus\]. In the case of Aviola and Tubero, the power of the fires broke up the cold humours of the syncope.

With regard to the inhabitants of Lucomorye, I should perhaps be correct in replying that the author himself tells it simply as a story he has heard from other people, and therefore keeps repeating the phrase \'it is said\'. But if the story he tells is true, it should be put down to conjuring-tricks by evil spirits. \[Such tricks\] are very common in that part of the world, as lycanthropy among the Nervi makes clear, and meanwhile one must presume that the inhabitants have been numbed by sleep after the usual manner of dormice and bears.

From those deceptions by an evil spirit has arisen a ridiculous conviction held by witches \[strigum\]. They believe that sometimes the oxen or rams they have killed, boiled or roasted, and then eaten are instantly brought back to life later on by an evil spirit, and it is not difficult to account for the various ways in which an evil spirit is able to do this.

\(1\) He can do it by binding up the eyes of onlookers and then, of course, sending \[pictures\] into the organ by means of a humour or some other way in which they can be imprinted, or by agitating the \[physical\] spirits in the imagination and bringing them in this state to the common sense and the organs of the external senses to which images and semblances which have been impressed on them by agitation \[of the physical spirits\] and by the object of the senseimpression normally descend. These semblances are usually retained there, but the very process of recognition often influences them in such a way that the external sense thinks it has been equally affected as though it really were being changed by the external object. It is the kind of thing which usually happens to a sleeper in his dreams, but the Devil can also make it happen to people while they are awake, because physical organs obey non-physical substances as far as local motion is concerned. (This is his method according to St Thomas \[Aquinas\]. Read his Evil, question 16, article 11).

\(2\) He can do this by substituting one thing for another, because what prevents an evil spirit from removing the dead ox, along with its skin and bones, and putting in its place a live OX which looks like the dead one, and doing this so quickly that the speed of the exchange escapes the notice of the bystanders? In the meantime, while he is taking away the corpse and replacing it with another ox, by inserting a cloud or \[performing\] some other conjuring-trick he can make sure the bystanders do not see that the place is empty and the OX has been taken away.

\(3\) Several witches \[nonnulli striges as \[Bartolommeo\] Spina says, confess that he can bring it about that when the king or queen of the journey or meeting⁵⁵² takes a stick and strikes the hide in which the bones have been collected and put in a pile. Then some evil spirit immediately gets underneath the skin, joins things together and assembles them, fits them into the shape of an ox, makes the large bulk stand upright, and then takes control of it so that it looks as though the original OX has been resuscitated.

\(4\) He can form a complete ox\'s body from air, with a new hide and new bones; or he can put together another aery body along with the bones left behind \[by the first ox\] and attach it to the rest of the hide and, when the time comes for him to do so, he can keep it intact under the hide, and make it move and bellow. Then later on, when he has to, he withdraws from it, and it will look as though the OX has collapsed and died. \'This\', says Spina, \'is why witches \[strigibus\], as a group, maintain that after such oxen, (which they believe have been resuscitated), are brought back to their masters\' byres, they die within three days, by command of the Lord or Mistress of the transvection, as though some wasting disease were shrivelling them up entirely in a matter of hours, and that after quivering for a short while, what seemed to be flesh quickly breaks up into the material it was before\', (in other words, air). (See Bartolommeo Spina, Inquiry into Witches, chapter 7.)
[Page 225]

But, (to return to the illnesses I was talking about), the miraculous resuscitations of Christ our Lord and of saintly men are easily distinguished from the cessations of those illnesses because, according to the evidence of the Faith, they were accomplished by a simple command or by a prayer poured out to God, not by an intervening period of time or delay. The body had been dissolved by putrefaction, too, and was stinking, as happened in the case of Lazarus. But in the illnesses we are discussing, the body continues to exist without decay and stench, and whenever the body has been restored \[to life\] one can easily see that it has been mangled and has fallen to pieces, sometimes after a very long time, to the truth of which St Maurilius in the case of a child dead for seven years and St Stanislaus in the case of someone called Petricus \[who had been dead for\] three years, testified in the case of the Church against Boleslaus. (See more about this in Miguel Medina, Correct Faith in God Book 2, chapter 7).

Book 2, Question 30

What power does magic have over the evil spirits \[cacodaemones\] themselves?

Books on the subject, written by some of the ancients, have perished. Battiades had written one about familiar spirits and Campester one about people possessed by spirits and spirits of the underworld. (They are cited by Fulgentius in his Moral Exposition of the Content of Vergil according to Philosophers). So, we have to look for help in other \[authors\], especially that touchstone of truth, sacred theology, and in proven histories. I think it is evident to any Catholic that magicians have no power at all over good angels or the souls of the blessed, and that they have no power at all over wicked \[angels\], either, unless they have made a pact with them. Therefore, evil spirits pretend that magicians are compelling them, and \[pretend\] to obey them of their own accord, in order to trap more people and keep hold of them once they have been ensnared. This now needs to be explained a little more clearly.

If you ask about good spirits or angels, I think they naturally have some power to compel evil \[spirits\], or at least to restrain them, but not indiscriminately. They can do this naturally in the case of evil spirits of inferior rank and order, but they cannot exercise this power unless God tells or allows them to do so. In the case of evil spirits of an equal order or rank, however, they have no natural power to compel them, but simply receive is sometimes by God\'s special concession and, so to speak, delegation. The same must be said about the power of evil spirits over evil spirits.

(I find that these are divided into diviners, that is, fortune-tellers: familiars, that is, personal servants or accessories: possessors, that is, those which afflict terribly those whom they besiege and dash to the ground-such was the one the Evangelist talks about-and paraders of dreams\', as Irenaeus calls them more than once, that is, removers of bad dreams or displayers of good ones). All these types pretend to obey magicians, and they all have something in common-some are of higher rank, some of lower. But whereas good angels willingly and eagerly obey their superiors, evil spirits, on the contrary, do not obey their superiors, just as vicious slaves \[do not obey\] harsh masters or a weaker \[person does not obey\] a more powerful tyrant except unwillingly and because they have been tamed by evil.

Consequently, it is also reasonable to say that among evil spirits, the subordination of one rank from which they fell to another is certainly not genuine and not one which is natural to them. The reason is that it lacks the formal structure and perfection of an orderly chain of command which is arranged, via stages of subordination, for one ultimate purpose. In this sense, Job was perfectly accurate when he said that no order is found in Hell. There is only a kind of imperfect or, (as they call it), \'material\' distinction of orders left there, which will last until the end of the world. In this sense theologians, including Cassian, recognise the hierarchy of evil spirits which the Apostle unambiguously confirms in his \[Epistle\] to the Ephesians, last chapter, verse 12, \'Against principalities and powers\', where you see him name two large groups while he is dealing with evil spirits.
[Page 226]

From this natural strength and pre-eminence among the order of evil spirits is also born the strength and power of certain magicians over others, whereby they either impede what the other \[magicians\] are doing or, in their turn, (with God\'s permission), badly injure or kill them by means of their own magic. This strife between them is, as it were, a struggle between the evil spirits with whom the contending magicians are allied by a pact. I told the story of one struggle in Burgundy in Book One.

Here is a second I came across when members of the Faith told me about it. Two magicians came together at the court of the English queen in order to put on an entertaining show and made a remarkably friendly agreement to obey each other in one \[of their tricks\]. The first one told the other to look down from a window, but when he did this, all of a sudden stag\'s horns sprouted from his head and for a long time everyone wanted to pull faces and mock him. Consequently, rendered powerless by the insult and wanting to avenge himself in a more savage fashion, \[the second magician\] drew a human figure on a wall with charcoal, then ordered the first magician to go up to the figure. As he was about to do so, he noticed it was devising instant death for him and, filled with horror, he warded it off with prayer.

The other \[magician\] reminded him forcefully of their agreement and so, under this compulsion, \[the magician\] went up to \[the figure\]. The wall seemed to make room for his body as he approached, but once he had come right up to \[the wall\], he was never seen again anywhere afterwards. In other words, an evil spirit of higher rank had killed him and taken his body away to an uninhabited place or a cave somewhere else.

I shall transcribe a third \[example\] in the words of C, a German, who tells the story as something he heard from someone else. \'In N\', he says, \'an illusionist \[praestigiator\] who came from a good family decapitated their host\'s servant, in a public guest-house, at the request of the other guests. But when he wanted to put the man\'s head back on again, he noticed there was another magician in the room who was stopping him from carrying out his intention. \[The illusionist\] asked him not to do that, but when \[the magician\] would not comply after being asked more than once, the illusionist made a lily grow on the table, and when he cut off its head and flowers, the magician who had been impeding him immediately fell \[from his seat at\] the table minus his head; and straight away, without hindrance, the illusionist put the magician\'s head on the servant and then fled the guest-house and the city to avoid being arrested by the magistrate on a charge of murder.⁵⁵ In this case, the illusion lay in cutting off the first head and replacing it, and also in producing the lily and cutting its head off. The context took place between the magicians\' evil spirits, the one of lower rank being strong enough to hinder the power of the illusion but, compelled by the more powerful \[spirit\]-not unwillingly, in my opinion-to comply with the murder of his client, who was of very little importance to him and who really was killed.

A fourth \[example\] concerns Zyto of Bohemia, a well-known illusionist, who was engaged in a contest with Bavarians. Jan Dubravius tells us what happened. \'Wenceslaus, Emperor and King of Bohemia\', he says, \'was a relation by marriage of John, the Prince of Bavaria, because he had married his daughter, Sophia.⁵⁵⁷ His father-in-law knew that his son-in-law took pleasure in stage-plays and magical illusions, and so he filled a wagon with actors and illusionists and took them with him to Prague. There, while the most remarkable of the performers was displaying his professional stunts to delight people\'s eyes, among the spectators was Zyto, Wenceslaus\'s magician, his mouth gaping open in a great yawn. He came nearer the Bavarian performer and suddenly swallowed him and all his equipment, with the exception of his shoes which he spat out because they seemed to be covered in mud. Looking for a way to get rid of \[what he had swallowed\], he unburdened his stomach, which was heavy with its unusual food, into a bathtub filled with water and restored the illusionist, still wet, to the spectators\'.
[Page 227]

In this case, Zyto\'s evil spirit was the more powerful. The business of swallowing was merely an illusion, but the unfortunate \[performer\] was genuinely snatched away and thrown into the tub of water by the evil spirit, not discharged via the pathways of \[Zyto\'s\] bowels. My fifth \[example\] will be taken from Olaus \[Magnus\] Book 3, chapter 20. Here a magician called Gilbert was arguing with Catillus, his instructor, about superiority in the practice of magic. \[Catillus\] pointed a tiny stick inscribed with Gothic or Ruthenian characters at him, so \[Gilbert\] took hold of him. \[Catillus\] became rigid at once and was carried away, trussed up, to an underground cave on an island in a lake called \'Veter\' by the Ostrogoths.

Saxo Grammaticus mentions a sixth \[example\] in Book 1 of his history of Denmark. It is about an old man who was a very eminent magician, as is proved by the fact that this one man surpassed all the men of Perm who are fierce in their reliance on magic. The story is a long one, so if anyone wants to read it, my indication is that it occurs in Saxo at the point where he describes a battle between Hading and Thuning. In addition to this, I am happy to refer to a story told by the Greeks about a contest between the soothsayers Calchas and Mopsus, which ended in Calchas\'s defeat and death. This, therefore, is the power of evil spirits over evil spirits and of magicians over them.

Book 2, Question 30, Section 2 \[sic\]

Holy people have often received from God an extraordinary power to keep evil spirits under control, as is attested by the innumerable miracles whereby those \[saints\] have got the better of them and overthrown them. This same power has always invested the sacraments, sacramental, and exorcisms of the Catholic Church, and this power is not found outwith her. Certain \[practices\] similar to our exorcisms, instituted in earlier times by Solomon, seem to have flourished among the Jews. This is proved not only by Josephus, Origen, and St Epiphanius, but also by the words of our Saviour when he confronted the Jews on the grounds that they were saying He was expelling evil spirits in \[the name of\]

Beelzebub. \'In whose name do your children expel evil spirits?\' He said \[Luke 11.19\] and learned men have been right in thinking that this is more correctly referred to the Jews\' usual exorcists than to the Apostles, because when this exchange was taking place, the Apostles had not yet been sent to preach, and this power was granted to them after \[they had been\]. The disciples also suffered the same malicious charge as their teacher, as Jesus predicted they would in Matthew \[10.17-18\].

Consequently, the Lord had not used the example of His Apostles and disciples to sufficient effect because the Jews replied straight away that they accomplished these things in the same name as the Master. In my opinion, Solomon had instituted these exorcisms at a time when he was still cleaving to God, and therefore God\'s power made them work. Perhaps, too, they continued to have some power from their \[original\] establishment by God, but not, I think, as much as there is these days in an exorcism \[carried out\] by the Catholic Church. If, however, you argue that they were instituted by Solomon when he was an idolater, you will be forced to attribute the, (as St Thomas \[Aquinas\] and \[Francisco de Vitoria do), to magicians\' incantations, all of whose power rests upon a pact with an evil spirit. But I prefer my first explanation.

Therefore, since the whole power of magicians over evil spirits depends on and arises from the covenant they have made with them, it undoubtedly follows that if a magician has a pact with an evil spirit of higher rank, he cannot exercise this power of this higher-ranking spirit. But through that higher-ranking spirit which is acting as his servant and assisting him because of their pact, he can compel evil spirits of lower rank to do something, or not to do it, and to prevent them from carrying out something they could otherwise have done. This is proved by the complaint of the Chaldaean magician in St Augustine who \'kept complaining that the great effort he was making to be successful in purging his soul was rendered ineffectual because a man who had power over this and was touched by envy had bound the Powers he had invoked with holy prayers, the result being that they could not grant what was demanded of them.\'
[Page 228]

Therefore one evil spirit bound what another could not undo. Eusebius tells us the same thing, and quite clearly it applies to the magician Cynops in Prochorus, (whoever he was), \[who says\] that when \'St John was questioning evil spirits about why they were in the habit of obeying Cynops, one of them replied, \"Because the entire power of Satan resides in him, and he has a treaty and pact with every one of our princes. We, too, on our part, have a pact with him and so Cynops obeys us and we him\". In the absence of such a pact, every attempt made by magicians against evil spirits is useless, since these work only because of the pact, (as I said in question 2.)

Hence first of all comes Apollo\'s lie when he answered the magician: Listen to me. I am not willing, because you have bound me by force\', (Eusebius, quoting Porphyry).

He was replying of his own accord, but he was pretending that he was being compelled by a contract which had been renewed seven times, \[a contract\] he himself had drawn up, as it clear from another passage in Eusebius\'s Proof of the Gospel Book 4, which begins KAnišelv \'Epuñv, \[They call Hermes\], etc. Then there is also the fiction, as if said by a suppliant: Furthermore, release the king. A mortal does not hold a god captive any longer\'.

The utterly vile evil spirit is speaking about himself and is demanding that the magician release him. In addition to this, magicians\' boasting about their ability to conjure up evil spirits and apparitions is worthless. Nor is there any power in the herb \[called\] \'Dogshead\' or \'Osiris\'s herb\', as Apion was silly enough to claim. Worthless, too, were Numa\'s boasting and ceremonies, and other dissembling visions produced-merely as the result of a pact, regardless of the power they had to compel them-by the magician Sicidita, (see Nicetas), Theodorus Santabirinus, (see Zonaras), and John the German.

Let me write down what one reads about that last one in the author of the German adages, because it is appropriate, and not unpleasant, to blunt the boasting of certain people who are themselves morally degenerate, and prattle about the smoky images of their ancestors, and \[say\] they did things they themselves have not done. Hence, they write that although \[John\] was illegitimate, he had a great reputation for learning and was promoted to a canonry at Halberstadt, a post not usually granted to anyone unless he came from a good family. The fault common to good families-pride-made his fellow-canons despise him. He was irked by this and finally decided to remedy his annoyance.

He invited his colleagues to dinner and received them in most elegant fashion; and among all his other pleasantries he included mention of a magical performer and suggested that each man would surely like to see his own parents. They were indeed extremely keen to see them and after a while, by means of a wicked incantation, \[the magician\] evoked the misshapen shadowy forms of a cook, a pub landlord, a professional jester, and a peasant. \[The canons\] admitted they had sometimes seen these faces in their parents\' homes. \[John\'s\] own father was shown, too, dressed as a canon, with a fat paunch. The shadowy forms were dismissed, and then \[John\] said, \'Well now! Tell me honestly, is there anyone\'s father here you think is better born \[than the others\]?\' Thoroughly frightened and filled with shame, each of them went back home and from then on did not accuse John of any imperfection in his blood-line.

Likewise, it follows that one should come to the same conclusion about the ritual evocation of the gods of the ancients from \[besieged\] cities, the form of words for which was recorded by Sammonicus Serenus in Macrobius, \[Saturnalia 3.9.6-7\]. I know God has not infrequently granted this power to saintly people, and I pass over anyone else. St Stephen, Bishop of Perm, \'told the evil spirits, who were turning people away to prevent them from listening to him, to show themselves openly in visible form. They did as they were told and appeared-immensely tall, completely black, with horns \[on their heads\], and breathing out stench and flames\', (Sauer in his biography \[of St Stephen\], under the month of September).
[Page 229]

Book 2, Question 30, Section 3

Secondly, one concludes-and on this point \[Paolo\] Grillando seems to have made a mistake in question 3, number 23, when he talks about compulsion-no words and no physical objects have the power directly and of themselves to compel evil spirits to appear, come, go away, do something, or not do something. No physical objects can equal the strength of substances which are spiritual and different. Therefore, evil spirits cannot be affected by them naturally, although they can be affected supernaturally. Consequently, I do not agree with magicians when they produce various natural remedies against evil spirits, such as Hermes \[Trismegistus\] who said that evil spirits are brought by a suffumigation of aloe-wood or whale-sperm and driven away by one of sulphur. Porphyry and Proclus talk a great deal of similar nonsense, as do some people in Hippocrates who talk even greater nonsense. I do not agree with heretics who disparage all supernatural power in exorcisms and anything which has been consecrated and blessed, contrary to what other people do.

On the other hand, one cannot approve of the credulousness and superstitious behaviour of certain Catholics, either, who ascribe supernatural power to things which have not been consecrated, such as St John\'s wort, rue, horn, goat\'s dung, baths, and whippings, and think that an evil spirit is adversely affected by these and therefore is annoyed and driven away by them. When one whips the body of someone who is obsessed \[by an evil spirit\] too much, the illness becomes worse and intensifies, and so the sick person is made worse.

What is more, anger and sadness serve to increase those states of melancholia which the evil spirit wants to encourage; so while these stupid people want to harm the evil spirit by doing things such as this, they are actually helping him. Nor can you find anything here which is irksome to an evil spirit other than that he thinks he is being whipped in someone else\'s \[body\] and suffers pain in his pride. But this is one thing which should be of no importance at all to these floggers. The saints have sometimes done this, but their \'whips\', such as their voices and the soles of their shoes to help them, would miraculously torture the evil spirit. Baths are useful for purging the melancholic humour, and the leaves of rue and St John\'s wort cure problems with breathing and are wonderfully good for calming the humoral disorder caused by breathing problems.

Dung and goat\'s horn dispel the same problems with their acrid fumigation, and that proud fellow is angry, too, that he is being laughed at and made a fool of in someone else\'s \[body\]. It has therefore been very well observed by Konrad Wimpina and Francisco Vallés that evil spirits more frequently attack those who have too great a supply of black bile, because that humour provides a particularly suitable way of making people frenzied and insane, and evil spirits like it very much indeed. Consequently, they lay siege to melancholics and, for the most part, are the cause of illnesses stemming from black bile. Hence it follows that because they cannot change physical matter unless they connect active things with passive, they treat people badly if, once they have made use of physical things of this kind, the inclinations those people have to malice or deceit are expelled and their opposites introduced immediately.

Therefore, whatever physical things introduce into the sufferer\'s body an inclination contrary to the one the evil spirit needs for his active purpose \[also\] cleanse the physical humours directly and expel \[the sufferer\'s\] physical illness naturally. Indirect causes alone, however, are the reason the spirit runs away and deserts that body, and in the absence of these, he does not do so. On this understanding, it will be permissible for those under siege by an evil spirit to possess and carry on their person stones or herbs which are naturally effective \[in these cases\] without, however, any \[accompanying\] incantation. This is what is generally thought.
[Page 230]

Certain objections are usually raised against this. (1) In Josephus, Antiquities Book 8, chapter 2, \[section 6\], Eleazar draws out an evil spirit by using a particular root. Someone may respond, perhaps this was instituted by Solomon at the same time as his exorcisms, and so it could have been possible that God worked supernaturally in the herb. That is scarcely likely to be true after the introduction and promulgation of Christianity. My opinion is rather that Eleazar was a magician and did what he did as a result of a pact \[with an evil spirit\], and the circumstantial details added by Josephus will easily convince the careful reader of this. The power of the root he dug up in such a superstitious fashion seems to be of the same kind as the one \[Josephus\] writes about in The Jewish War Book 7, chapter 25.

\(2\) There is a passage in Tobit which runs as follows: \'if you put a small part of the heart\' \[of the fish \"Callyonimus\"\] \'on top of charcoal, its smoke will clear out every kind of evil spirit\', and we read later that this was done. My response is that this suffumigation drove the spirit away indirectly. The angel Raphael was the one who expelled the evil spirit directly and despatched him to an uninhabited place. In consequence, the whole action was attributed to Raphael afterwards, \'He (Raphael) chased away the evil spirit from her\'. The power as a natural property, however, is attributed to the \[fish\'s\] heart not in a literal, but in a prophetic and symbolic sense, because it must be referred back to Christ, our Lord, who freed the Magdalene from the evil spirits which had possessed her, and has also freed us from the tyranny of the Devil. This is not my comment, but that of St Prosper \[of Aquitaine\]. At some length, and in many words, he says the following, among everything else: \'He feeds His disciples on the shore fully from Himself, and offers Himself to the whole world as an ixdúv \[fish\], and because our ancestors explained \"fish\" in Latin by reference to sacred letters which they deduced from the Sibylline verses that \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, the Saviour\", is a fish cooked in His own suffering, by whose inward aids we are illuminated and fed every day\'.

You will understand this somewhat obscure saying if you read St Augustine from whom he took it. Certainly, Christ is called a fish by Tertullian. \'But we are born in water as little fish, according to the example of our ixdúv, \[Jesus Christ\], and we are not saved in any way other than by remaining in the water\'.

\(3\) They beckon us in the direction of David\'s harp but do so in vain because in that instance it was not the pleasant tune which was the direct cause of putting the evil spirit to flight. When the King had been soothed by the harmoniousness of the music, as long as David was playing the harp, at any rate, the humours which were agitating him started to settle themselves down to some extent, and in the meantime were in a less suitable state to be affected by the evil spirit\'s stirring them up. This is why the wicked \[spirit\] began to retire at that moment-not because it was pleased or offended by the music, but because it would find it difficult to put up with the fact that its possession of its dwelling-place was being thrown into disorder, so to speak, by this improvement in the mingling of \[the King\'s\] humours. Many Catholics agree with this opinion of Rabbi Moses of Egypt \[Maimonides\]. The notion some people have about the evil spirit\'s inclination for harmony is, of course, worthless. This is where magicians get their nonsense that one should offer Saturn singing which is mournful and the rest of the planets singing which is cheerful and happy. (Guillaume d\'Auvergne refuted this a long time ago). Others take refuge in symbolism and maintain that the evil spirit really was put to flight by the sound of the harp, but that this was done by the power and merit of Christ\'s cross of which the harp was a symbol.
[Page 231]

In connection with this third point, one\'s conclusion is that poets\' beliefsee the heretic \'Palingenius\', \[The Zodiac of Life\] Book 10 or \'Capricorn\', and the Catholic Pierre de Ronsard\'s Hymn on Evil Spirits-that magicians can bind evil spirits fast in small jars, mirrors, or rings the way criminals are locked up in the stocks or tied fast to a board is not true. This is either because a more powerful \[spirit\], or one of higher rank, always compels them to be there and keeps them there by his command, or because they are there of their own accord and pact \[with the magician\] and keep themselves there. Consequently, one must strongly disapprove of the treatise by Hermes \[Trismegistus\] in which he published instructions for binding evil spirits, and the lies told by Apollo and Hecate in Theodoret\'s book on oracles, in which they say they have been constrained to appear by \[certain\] forms of words.

As well as these two authors, Porphyry makes the \[same\] lying claim. This, as I have said, has been attributed to the opinion of the Fathers \[of the Church\] and the Schoolmen. What Heinrich of Hesse said on this subject in his \[commentary\] on Genesis is very well worth noting. \'\[The evil spirit\] pretends he has been taken prisoner in order to take you prisoner: that he has been vanquished in order to vanquish you: that he is subject to your orders in order to subject you to his: that he has been imprisoned by you so that, in the end, he can imprison you. He pretends he has been bound fast in an image or stone by your magic so that, once he has bound you fast by the ropes of your sins, he can lead you to Hell.⁵⁷⁰ (You can read more in confirmation of these points in Gianfrancesco Pico \[della Mirandola\], Foreknowledge of Things Book 7, chapter 4.)

\[Alonso\] Tostado has provided a closely argued, though verbose, argument on this topic as follows. \'It is not possible for a lesser power to subject a greater power to itself, and there is no power on earth which is comparable to that of evil spirits, (Job chapter 40). Therefore there will not be anything in the way of Nature or ritual by which human beings can compel evil spirits to come, to reply to questions, or to do anything \[for them\], unless you object that the Church\'s exorcisms \[do just that\], in which case it has to be said that \[the spirits\] are compelled to do something, namely, to leave the bodies of those they have been besieging, or not to do them harm.

But this is done by God, in as much as He Himself instituted what is done by the Church and therein lies hidden the operative power of God, just as in the working of the sacraments. God, however, is not working in the operations of workers of harmful magic whereby they want to compel evil spirits, because these \[operations\] are contrary to God\'s honour. Therefore, workers of harmful magic cannot compel evil spirits \[to do\] anything. The evil spirits, though, lie and pretend they are being compelled, because herein lies their greatest power of persuasion. If we could not compel them to come or answer questions or do anything, but whatever they might do they would do voluntarily, human beings would stop having recourse to them, on the grounds that they could achieve nothing with their assistance and withdraw themselves from them.

But since human beings think they can compel them, because \[the spirits\] pretend \[to be compelled\], they are very much influenced to acts of harmful magic, as if by these means they can obtain everything they want; and evil spirits are keen that they do this so that, through this kind of error and influence, they can keep humans\' minds in chains. Yet evil spirits cannot really be compelled by human beings through acts of harmful magic. Indeed, if they could be compelled, they would not teach human beings how to do it because if humans really could subject evil spirits to them, they would thereby make the spirits more wretched \[than they are already\]. So \[the spirits\] pretend they have been subjected, (although in fact they have not), so that they can deceive \[the humans\], and are content to act as their servants for the time being, although actually evil spirits would not be willing to be subjected to human beings for any money.
[Page 232]

Nothing is truer than this. But how dangerous it is to imagine one has imprisoned this kind \[of spirit\] and has them under one\'s control is proved by various examples. One, recounted by Johannes Nider as follows, will be sufficient. \'A little before the present General Council, a man of wicked life had a house in Kleinbasel and, as it happened, and had come under reasonable suspicion of performing acts of harmful magic \[maleficiis\]. He had a daughter and married her to a young man in his house, and when at length the old man fell ill, he pointed out a box to his daughter and son-in-law and said, \"Don\'t move this little box, because if you do, you\'ll regret it. Let it stay where it is after I am dead\", and thus not long afterwards the old man expired.

A long time went by. Neither his daughter nor her husband paid any great heed to her father\'s instruction, and when they moved from their former home to another little house which was big enough \[for them\], they carried the box to their new home. During the journey, however, it started to weigh so much that \[the husband\'s\] strength failed him, and he called on his wife to help him. Whether his wife opened the box later in the house, or whether somehow or other she forgot \[what her father had said\] about the box, people agree on one thing-the two of them came into their new house with a small child they had begotten. Well now, all of a sudden, the wife rushed at the cradle like a raving mad woman, with the intention of killing the child. Her husband saw this, forcibly seized hold of his wife, and realised she was under the control of an evil spirit. While the evil spirit was being exorcised, it threatened it would not leave unless \[her husband\] killed her, which he did in spite of the exorcist\'s trying to prevent him. Next day her husband was making his way along a pavement in the town when, quite unexpectedly, he was struck by a stone falling from the upper part of a water-channel which was coming away \[from the building\]. It struck him, apparently with the co-operation of an evil spirit, in the face and rendered him so ugly that he scarcely seemed to be a human being.\'

\[Pierre\] Crespet has much to say about these imprisoned \[spirits\], because sometimes they appear to their masters. Some have to be worshipped with a particular ritual because they are connected with Saturn, others because they are connected with Jupiter, others because they are connected with Venus, and others because they are connected with Mercury, etc. At fixed times in the night, they rouse their owner and, on occasion, talk to him, unless they prefer to do something wicked. In France and Italy, they are for sale and always ruin those who buy them. (Crespet goes into greater detail in The Hatred of Satan Book 1, discourse 12).

Holy men, however, have not infrequently imprisoned or bound up evil spirits in certain things: St Conon, for example, about whom the Jesuit Matthias Rader gives the following account in The Succession of the Months among the Greeks, under \'March\'. \'He exercised such great force and power over evil spirits that he would put some of them in charge of the fields and make them guardians of the crops. Others he would imprison in sealed-up buildings and bury in the foundation of a church he intended to build. Likewise, St Lupus imprisoned one in Sens, afflicting him with thirst and inserting him, wailing and proclaiming who he was, in a small vessel of cold water he had told someone to bring. (This is what his ancient biographer says in Sauer, under the month of September.)
[Page 233]

So, we read that Asmodeus was bound by the Archangel Raphael in an uninhabited place, (Tobit 8.2); and that four angels, bound in the great River Euphrates, were released by God\'s command, (Apocalypse 9.14 and 15); and that the Devil was chained up by an angel for a thousand years and sent into the abyss, (Apocalypse 20.2). No one denies Asmodeus is an evil spirit. Tichonius in Homily 7, Andreas of Caesarea, and Bede quite correctly maintain in relation to that verse that these four angels were evil spirits; and by \'binding\' one means \[being bound\] to a particular place and not just in a mystical sense to the hearts of the wicked, as Ambrose \[Autpert\] finally proved conclusively in these words: \'I think one must interpret the binding of the Devil literally to mean he is being held in bondage by the power of God in some place in the abyss, or certainly in Hell, until the day of his release\'.

St Gregory sticks to the letter \[of the text and says the same thing in his commentary on Job Book 4, chapter 12, and Andreas of Caesarea quite correctly adds that in Catholic interpretation \[of the text\], the more powerful operation whereby the malice of an evil spirit is constrained is called a \'chain\', because these means \[of restraint\] are bonds and ropes and are called this elsewhere, (2 Peter 2.4, and Vol. 6 of the Jewish canon). Caesarius \[of Heisterbach\] says that an evil spirit imprisoned in the body of demoniac was forced by exorcism to say that there are three phrases in the canon of the Mass whereby Lucifer was bound up in Hell as if by chains, namely, \"Through Him and with Him and in Him\'. (Read Book 5, chapter 13 of his Discussion of Miracles.)

Saints can vanquish evil spirits as follows: (i) as servants of God, by injecting fear and making threats which an evil spirit knows are not usually ineffectual; (ii) by withdrawing the divine agreement obtained from God which means that evil spirits cannot be moved from a place, (which, were it not for that, they could do); and (iii) by imprinting on evil spirits some spiritual condition and detaining force-\[exorcism\] being an example of this-whereby these non-physical spirits are detained unwillingly in Hell and tortured by physical flames.

The practices and forms of words used in exorcism, with which an evil spirit is sometimes excommunicated and, as it were, despatched to the lowest dwelling-place in Hell and fettered there as I have described, tell us about the first of these methods. Consequently, St Augustine, made use of the language of Honorius\'s edict and proclaimed an interdict. (See The City of God Book 20, chapter 7). Palladius reminds us of the second method in his life of St Macarius in which he deals with Jamnes, Mambres, and their tomb, (Lausiac History, chapter 20). The third method is more frequent and is commonly \[employed\] against all evil spirits because \[it pertains\] to their eternal punishment, on which read St Thomas \[Aquinas\] Part 1, question 64, article 4, contrary 3, Summa Against the Pagans Book 4, chapter 90, and the Bishop of Avila, \[Alonso Tostado\], in his \[Commentary on\] Matthew, chapter 25.

I have found a few \[examples\], however, which seem to attribute this power even to workers of harmful magic \[maleficis\]. But when one takes a closer look at these, they indicate merely that because of the pact the magician \[magum\] has made with a more powerful evil spirit, he can impede the activity and power of an evil spirit of lower rank, and so \[the spirit\] can sometimes be coerced by the magician, whether he is willing to be so or not. This, however, is done by the magician via the vicarious power of a stronger evil spirit, or rather, by making use of his power.
[Page 234]

Thus, in St Jerome\'s \[life of\] Hilarion, an evil spirit has to be held fettered by a piece of string and a metal plate; this is how Jamnes and Mambres, in the passage to which I have referred, bound many evil spirits. This is how one should interpret St Augustine when he writes that evil spirits are bound, put to flight, removed, and transferred from certain places and objects on the orders of \[evil spirits\] of higher rank, (The Divination of Evil Spirits, chapter 7), and this is how I interpret Eusebius when he says that evil spirits can be restrained by human beings, (Preparation for the Gospel Book 5, chapter 6). This is why Albertus \[Magnus\], \[Francisco\] Victoria, and every other Catholic theologian thinks they are enclosed, (according to popular belief), in rings as a result of a pact and kept there forcibly by a more powerful evil spirit, (if they actually are enclosed and kept there), or they pretend of their own accord that they are being kept there when a more powerful spirit has not been involved.

One infers that the spirits popularly called \'familiars\' or \'little Martins\' or \'little teachers\' act as servants to human beings entirely of their own accord. The Greeks call them πapéδpous \[those who sit beside you because they are constantly present. (Irenaeus and Tertullian have dealt with these.) Some people thought that Socrates\'s spirit \[daemonium\] was one of this sort. St Clement attributes one such to Simon Magus, Prochorus one such to Cynops, and Aristotle one such to a person from Thrace. In his Chronicles, \[Jean\] Froissard attributes one called Croton to a learned man. Cornelius Agrippa\'s dog was one such, and even if his pupil \[Johann\] Weyer denies it, everyone else quite rightly confirms it. I remember reading in Johannes Caesarius the exemplary story-well worth remembering-of a familiar spirit \[paredri\].

In this story, what one finds astonishing is that the evil spirit demanded five gold coins as his price and gave orders for a bell to be purchased with them for a poor church so that it could summon the faithful to divine worship every Sunday. There was undoubtedly some deception lying hidden here, and the hope of a larger sum of money was blindingly obvious. It is also remarkable that he caused the soldier no harm. Familiar spirits are scarcely ever in the habit of going away without doing harm to their masters since, for the most part, an evil spirit makes a contract for a particular period of time \[which stipulates that when that time is completed the evil spirit can either find another master, or \[his master will submit to being killed by his evil spirit, as Nicolas Rémy tells us in Book 1 of his Worship of Evil Spirits, illustrating his remarks with an example.

But this is enough about magic \[in general\]. Let us proceed to harmful magic.
