Saint Walbert, contemporary of Gregory VII and founder of the order, had there erected an oratory to the Blessed Virgin. In his life he had, when a dying monk was grievously terrified by a vision of a demon, driven it off with a cross which he took from the hand of the dying man. The monks preserved the cross there, and it soon served to test the possessed with it to determine whether they were truly demonic. Later the arm that had borne the crucifix to victory was also discovered; and from that time the Church of Our Lady at Valombrosa became a refuge for the possessed for all Tuscany; indeed, they came in swarms even as far as the borders of France. The healings increased, and since the year 1450 the occurrences had also found someone to record them in writing. \\[Page 4\\]\n\nResponding to the urging of the physician Laurentius, who had been present on the spot, Hieronymus of Raggiolo, an active and very pious man, from what he there found, learned from credible old people, and saw with his own eyes, compiled eighteen books on the demonic healings.

When the exorcism was applied, his spirit began to speak and recounted how he, bound by a charm, could not free himself until that charm placed under his threshold was removed. The monks, however, attached no credence to these words and continued with the invocation. The possessed then became entirely furious, and with a wild, burning eye cried out: \"O cross! O torment! what must I endure; for what, you villains, all the praying, and the singing and toil! You well know what I said before.\" Some of those who had brought him into the monastery thought now that one must remove whatever might be found there; the monks, however, prevented anyone from proceeding to the work, so that it should not appear as if they had credited the devil, or that he had only departed after the removal of the charm. They therefore continued calmly and unconcerned with the exorcism; but he now tore himself away from the hands of those holding him, was thrown to the ground by the demon, and tormented as never before. This continued for a while; at last the demon, exhausted and unable to resist further, departed.\n\nBut it was worth the trouble, says Hieronymus, to hear what voices he uttered, even afterwards wandering about in the sanctuary; it would have seemed incredible to me were it not for the credible persons who, as eyewitnesses, gave me an account of everything.

A woman from Calcia was possessed on the eve of the Feast of Our Lady of the Snows. They took the sufferer to Valombrosa, and Hieronymus of Raggiolo himself exorcised her there; but her demon remained silent for a long time. Then a stranger monk, well versed in necromancy, happened to come by and begged to be allowed to speak something into the mouth (ear) of the possessed woman. He was permitted, and he delivered his speech. Immediately the demon looked at him threateningly and burst out with the words: \"Hypocrite and flatterer, not a brother, but a corrupter! How dare you in this holy place, with evil art, force him whom God has not yet forced? You would rue it on the spot, if what you bear on your breast were your work.\" The monk answered: \"I do not fear your threats!\" The demon then formally challenged him, and the challenge ran to the Alps or elsewhere, wherever it pleased him; \"you will not reach Perusium without having felt my power!\" When the monk on his journey had come to the Perusinian lake, he sat down, weary, beneath an olive tree on the bank of the water. In a short while a black vapor and smoke rose from the waves, wrapped him completely in night and shape, and then lifted itself into the air. The monk died, probably of fright, in Perusium. (The word he had spoken into the woman's ear was probably the formula: Exi daemon quia Ephimolei tibi praecipiunt!) For, according to necromantic tradition, these words have the power, in distinguishing possession from falling sickness, to act healingly upon it. If the possessed person falls, having heard the formula, and drops senseless, but after some time rises again and relates what has just happened --- proclaiming things true and unknown --- then he ought to be freed; but if nothing of the kind occurs, then it is the falling sickness that is afflicting him.

When a priest, honest in faith and religious disposition, perceived this, and reflected that true signs could not stand with a false doctrine, he carried the Body of the Lord in a pyx to the river where these people were performing their powers before the people, and spoke aloud in the hearing of all present: I adjure you, Satan, by Him whom I hold here in my hands, that you cease, on this river, to exercise such conjuring to the corruption of these people!

The same appears in another account preserved by his contemporary Cantipratanus. When M. Conrad preached in Germany against the heretics, where he also suffered the martyr's death, one of them, as I heard from Brother Conrad, the Dominican provincial in Germany, being led astray by demons, sought to win over a brother of the same order to the heresy. But when he perceived the brother's violent resistance he said to him: \"You are very stubborn in your faith, of which, however, you know only some things from Scripture; but if you were to give me your belief, I would by actual sight show you Christ, his mother, and the saints themselves.\" The brother suspected a deception of the demon, but, because he wished to try what was true in the matter, he said: \"I would with good reason give you belief if you could accomplish that.\" The heretic rejoiced at this, and set a day for the meeting; the brother, however, took the Sacrament of the Body of Christ secretly under his cloak with him. The heretic now led the brother into the cave of a mountain, into a spacious, light-filled palace. As they entered the interior of the castle they saw thrones set there as of the purest gold, upon which sat a light-encircled king and a queen arrayed in serene beauty; at her side were chairs of the elders, who, like patriarchs and apostles, surrounded her in the midst of the angels; everything shone so that it seemed anything but demonic. When the introducer beheld them, he fell on his face and worshipped them. The brother, however, stood unmoved, astonished at the spectacle before his eyes. Then the heretic turned to him and said: \"Why do you not worship the Son of God whom you see before you? Come forward, and, paying him homage, receive from his mouth the mysteries of our faith!\" The brother then came nearer, drew out the pyx, and offered it to the queen who sat on the throne, saying: \"Are you indeed the queen and mother of Christ? See there your son! If you acknowledge him, then I will acknowledge you as his mother.\" At these words the whole phantom vanished, and after the fading of the brightness so dense a darkness spread that the brother with his guide scarcely found the way out.

In the Rhaetian Alps, about twelve years earlier, there was a pious priest who, being summoned to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist to a sick man and the road being long, mounted a horse and, after hanging the pyx with the sacrament about his neck, rode on his way. After riding for a while someone met him who invited him to dismount from the horse so that, in his company, he might witness a wonderful spectacle. The parish priest, out of curiosity, imprudently followed the invitation, and had hardly alighted from his horse when he felt himself borne through the air with his companion. After a short while they stood on the summit of an exceedingly high mountain, in a wide, exceedingly lovely plain, bordered by the noblest trees and enclosed by dreadful rocks. Beneath the trees they found ring-dances winding and divers sorts of games, tables laden with costly foods; they heard sounds and songs full of every loveliness; whatever could delight the mind and gladden the heart was present there in abundance. \\[Page 23\\]\n\nThe simple, good clergyman, astonished at the unexpected sight, and, from wonder, daring neither to speak nor to move, stood there as if stunned and out of his senses. Then the companion who had brought him said: would he not venerate the queen present, and visit her with a gift? She sat on a high throne, dressed in royal adornment; all those present approached her, two or four at a time and in perfect order prostrating themselves before her, and paying her homage while presenting gifts. The clergyman, when he thus perceived her in the radiance of her glory, surrounded by many, believed: it was the Mother of the Lord, the Queen of Heaven and Earth; and he had no inkling that anything demonic was hidden behind her. Considering to himself what he should present to her as a gift, he thought: he could bring her nothing dearer or more pleasing than the body of her Son. So he went up to her, and, as he fell at her feet, he took the little case with the Sacrament, which he had hung about his neck, and laid it in the woman's lap. Wonderful! Everything vanished at once. The man, struck by this, now recognized how he had been ensnared by false signs and wonders; and when he found himself abandoned in the gloom of dense forests, he cried to God for help with trembling, that He would deliver him from such dangers.

This man, after having strongly admonished him, at last --- once he had obtained a safeguard for every contingency --- led him at noon to a crossroads. There he drew a circle around him with his sword, and then warned him: that in his absence he should not make the sign of the cross, give or promise anything to the demanding spirits, nor by terror or encouragement be induced to bring even a limb of his body out of the circle, because otherwise he would be dead; after this he went away. The knight sat for a while in the circle, when he perceived the inundation of many waters coming toward him; he heard the roaring of furious winds, then the grunting of many swine; but none of this could frighten him. Soon, however, he saw in the nearby wood a dreadful shape, like the shadow of a man, coming toward him over the trees, and understood that it was the Devil. The figure stopped at the circle, and asked him what he wanted. It was to be compared to a great, exceedingly black man, clad in garments of the same color, and so hideous that the knight could not bear to look at it. Meanwhile he said to the coming one: You come to me at the right time, for I have asked to see you. --- For what? --- I have heard much of you. --- What have you heard? --- Much evil, little good! --- The Black (one) replied: Often people judge without cause; I have injured no one without being provoked; therefore ask your master, who is my friend, whether I have ever done him any harm; I do what pleases him, and he commands me in all things.

He had given himself up, by constant association, to learned but unbelieving people, magicians, and men of similar ilk, who initiated him into their arts and doctrines and infected him with their evil habits. He, who now wished to put into practice what he had learned theoretically, in order thereby to satisfy his desires --- which he could not accomplish without demonic help --- allowed himself to be carried away by them to give himself over to him who granted them and to his service, and in turn to seduce others to that service. The relationship had already continued for a good number of years, when one night he was so badly mistreated and almost strangled by him to whom he had given himself, that --- since even his mother had pleaded to God in prayer for that reason --- against his will he resolved to return to God and to call for His help.\n\nPartly on the advice of his elders, partly through the encouragement of Father Carolus von Belitri, Vicar of the Holy Office in Tarvis, finally determined, he betook himself, as to a safe place, to the house of the Office with that vicar, as to a friend. He was now to go there to confession, and for that purpose a pious and discerning theologian was chosen; who, finding him by no means sufficiently prepared, took every pains to bring out what was still lacking by his exhortation and to examine his conscience in a fitting manner. But behold, at that moment his evil spirit again began to seize upon all his senses, and repeatedly to call out from his mouth: I, I am Satan; I, I am this man's lord and owner; he, he may not and cannot make his confession, and I will never permit it. By virtue of the pact which he has concluded with me, he is bound to me and belongs to me; he has solemnly promised me to obey me in all things, never to make a proper confession, nor ever to forsake me. The clergyman was at first frightened by this speech, but then, strengthened in the Lord, he asked the speaker what he wanted here. Thereupon the instigator of all evil answered: This man is the worst scoundrel, who has long consorted with unbelievers, still possesses many of their books, and is always ready for every evil; since he therefore does not commit as much evil as his baseness and wickedness prompt him to, I remain here to watch over him. Thus and the like said the crafty guardian who had plunged him into the abyss of all vices, and who now vaunted himself to be guarding him against greater evil. But when the priest ceased to speak of things that concerned his soul's salvation and turned to indifferent matters, the voice likewise at once ceased to speak through him, and did not hinder him in the use of his senses and faculties. Yet when another time the priest exhorted him with exorcisms not to hinder his confession any longer, the man burst into a furious laugh, and, with face, mouth, and fists, attacked the exorcist, mocking and scoffing at him, so that he appeared utterly mad. If the clergyman desisted a second time, he likewise ceased his rages and his laughter and his taunts, and addressed him seriously and with mature consideration, like a learned and prudent man; asserting at the same time that he from the bottom of his heart cursed all wrongdoing. \\[Page 28\\]\n\nBut as soon as, with his mouth --- the man who spoke these words --- he would renounce these misdeeds, confess them sacramentally in confession, or would name the companions and co\u2011sinners of his vices, he immediately felt his heart bound and pressed; whereupon he then burst forth with the greatest violence and vehemence, and was driven to laughter and ridicule by a power which he could not resist. He confessed that it inwardly determined and carried him away to despise, to deride and to abase the priest who advised him to do penance; and nothing then appeared to him more pleasing and delightful than to hold all religious people and clerics, all clerical ordinations, offices, usages and ceremonies in contempt, to mock them and to trample them underfoot. This did not happen merely once, but whenever he was appointed to any act that could be useful to his soul; especially when, being persuaded by the priest, he was to renounce his errors before the Vicar of the Inquisition. Then he at once broke out into the most violent derisive laughter, and although he strove to drive away force with force, and to write while kneeling and to produce good acts, nothing came of it; he was suddenly overcome by the demon, upset the inkwell, and fled, wrenching himself away with great fury. \\[Page 29\\]\n\nWho can resist referring all this to the evil spirit, which, supported by many years of bad habit, applied every means to assert its right over this its adherent. Not that it possessed him in his body, tormenting and afflicting him like the possessed, without extending its power to their souls. Rather it was, as with all sorcerers and evildoers, always present to him merely as the owner of his soul as well as of his body, and acted according to the circumstances; now in his body binding his heart, contracting it, expanding it, and exciting in it many often opposite passions; then again moving his throat, mouth, tongue, eyes, lips and the other members of the body in many ways; and alternately affecting his internal sensitive powers by diverse objects, as seemed advantageous to it, so that it might hold him forever in its subjection.\n\nNow I, relates Father Brognoli, in the same year, coming from Rome to Bergamo, lodged in a place only a little distance from the city, which that magician inhabited; I was urged by the venerable father\u2011provincial of that reformed province and by the clergyman of whom I have just spoken to take under my charge the aforesaid jurist, whom the clerical exorcists declared to be possessed by the demon, but whom the physicians pronounced insane. When he was brought to me, I first began to speak with him alone about many matters, and I recognized from his speech and answers soon that he was not foolish and out of his senses, as the physicians said, but of very sound understanding, learned, quick of spirit and sharp\u2011witted. Now, however, in the presence of that clergyman and of a noble jurist, his friend, I began to invoke the demon with exorcisms. But the one being exorcised was not, as commonly happens with the possessed, tormented by the exorcisms; instead he burst into laughter and threatened me with his fists. When I had seen this, and remembered the pact that he had concluded with the demon, and how he had already served him for eight years and been devoted to the magical being, I judged it necessary to employ other means.\n\nTherefore, partly urged by himself, partly appointed by the entreaties of his friend, the other legally trained man, as well as by the clerics, to take him more closely under my supervision; I went to the place where he himself lived, had from the Father Inquisitor the necessary authority over him transferred to me, and then, after invoking divine help, in the monastery there, in the presence of our reverend provincial, of a Father Definitor, and of the companion of that man, commanded in the name of our Lord the demon: that they in no way hinder the external or internal faculties and abilities of the person, and that they answer all my questions freely and without obstruction. \\[Page 30\\]\n\nI then asked him for what reason he had turned to our Order, and had especially summoned me, and what he required of me. He answered: So that I might learn whether I am bound by a maleficium, or possessed, or suffer from some other illness. For I feel my heart bound and compressed toward a young man, so that I can scarcely draw breath; and yet I will not break forth into love toward him; but that, I suppose, comes from a maleficium. If therefore you bring out that the evil has its origin in this; then I beg that by your remedies you will restore my health.\n\nWhen from this speech I perceived that he was not moved for the love of God, nor out of sorrow for having offended Him; but, like another Antiochus, willing to give way to the demon in order to avert the scourge from his body, I said to him: I assure you with all the certainty that a servant of Christ and of the Church can have, that if you are struck by a maleficium you shall be healed, on the following three conditions: First, you must obey me in all things that I shall command you, spirituallly or bodily. Secondly, you must reveal to me all the thoughts, words and deeds of your life, as far as possible, and especially from the time onward when you engaged with unbelievers and consorted with demons, up to this hour. Thirdly, you must give ear to the reasons and authorities which I adduce to persuade you of the evangelical truth; and if anything occurs to you in opposition, you must communicate it to me, so that I may resolve your doubts. He promised solemnly in the presence of the clerics and the legally trained man to fulfil all this.\n\nSo that he might not again break into his laughter and mock me, I commanded him on the spot to make the following retractation: \"I, N. N., have learned that whenever I would undertake any act conducive to my healing, I am compelled with the utmost force to laughter, and thus forced to reject all remedies useful to my body and soul. Therefore I declare here on my knees before God, my Creator and Redeemer, and before you, my spiritual father, with all my heart and with my whole soul and with all my strength: that if from this moment I laugh, or perform any act which is meant to express scorn and contempt, I do then laugh Beelzebub, the prince of the demons (so he called him to whom he had devoted himself), to scorn and derision, as do all his adherents; because they, out of pride, have abandoned their God, and, yielding themselves to eternal punishment, have forgotten Him.\" \\[Page 31\\]\n\n\"I will likewise laugh for joy that God, in the infinite fullness of his mercy and goodness, has forgiven me all my sins, which, whenever I laugh, I every time from my whole heart denounce; for they are insults against my God, Creator and Redeemer, whom I must love above all. Therefore, you devils, having tempted, moved, and driven me to laughter at your pleasure; yet it shall, according to my intention, always be to scorn you, and to the salvation of my soul!\"\n\nAfter all this had thus been arranged among us, the laughter was suddenly turned to sorrow. From then on, when things holy were spoken of, he never laughed again; rather he seemed seized by the deepest pain and the blackest melancholy. Wherefore I begged the others to leave us, so that I remained alone with him, and then questioned him about everything he had done and what had happened to him: about the pact he had concluded with the demon; about the confession he had made to him; his promises, accomplices; about the books of the heretics; his master H\u00e4mmerlein; about his presence at the Sabbath, and all that there is done there by the sorcerers, the lords and demons; the pleasures and the magnificences that he had obtained from the demon; finally, about everything that had occurred during the eight years that he had served him --- all of which he told me, albeit with some difficulty.\n\nHe said how, a year earlier, before he had bound himself to the demon, he had had much intercourse with magicians and malefactors, among whom there had been Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Manichaeans, but for the most part atheists; and how he then set himself to the study of their books and teachings. Then first he came to renounce God; and now he found himself prepared to perform everything necessary for the demonic confession. As to the initiation, he reported that it had proceeded thus: the act took place in the year 1638, in a cave of the Genoese mountains, to which he had traveled with nine other magicians, in the company of all the heretics with whom he had then been staying in a certain city on account of his studies.\n\nWhen they arrived at the appointed place they had found the demon there in human shape, sitting upon a stone; with fire-spraying eyes, a goat's beard, horns, clawed hands, ox-like feet; with a hoarser, thinner, but terrible voice. At his sight they all fell down with their burning pitch-torches, which they carried in their hands, and paid him homage by kissing his hindparts. Then the first magician rose from their circle and, while the others remained on their knees, addressed the seated one, setting forth how he brought a new novice to him --- a learned doctor of both laws, likewise well-instructed theologian, whom he presented here and begged him to receive among his own.\n\nThe Prince of Darkness, pleased thereat, answered that the neophyte should present his wishes. He replied: \"My wish is that you show me a treasure and the way to raise it; also that you use no deception or other trick upon me, but provide me with true gold and silver. Then you should teach me the art of going and walking invisibly to wherever my lust and desire strive. Furthermore, the demons that I call should not refuse to comply with my wishes, and should bring me everywhere I wish with the greatest speed, and perform everything that I demand of them.\" \\[Page 32\\]\n\nThe demon then said: All this is easy, if he first renounce God and firmly believe that there is no other God than him, the demon; renounce the remaining articles of faith, the sacraments and sacramentals; all his life hold religious and clerical persons in contempt and deride them; regard all clerical rites as null, never go to confession, and consider that confession itself as an invention of the priests to deceive the simple. The novice promised to observe all of this exactly, except the first. \"That there is no other God but the demon\" contradicts my reason, which bids me the contrary, he said. Then the most distinguished of the magi, who among them was regarded as a kind of bishop, took the mediation upon himself, addressing the newcomer with the words: If you will not immediately believe as I do that there is no god but the demon, then at least believe: there are two gods, one, the Creator of the invisible and spiritual things; the other, the demon, founder of all corporeal and visible things. The novice answered: I can readily give my belief to that.\n\nThus were now the Lord, the Holy Virgin, the sum of all articles of faith, sacraments, clerical rites and ceremonies abjured; and to the demon, after repeated kisses, fidelity was pledged, the confession made; and over all this a written bond was drawn up and sealed by the magician's own hand. He then received from the prince of demons a Martinet or Martinell assigned to him, so that it should be at his hand everywhere. This one, in company with the Martinelli of the other magi, brought before them a splendid carriage drawn by four white camels; which the whole magical society mounted, and was then borne with the greatest speed before sunset to the city which they inhabited. He told all this not jokingly, but in full seriousness; adding that he had earlier communicated it to the reverend inquisitor, before whose tribunal he had appeared, indeed with his mouth but not with his heart: all in accordance with what Petrus of Abano left in his writings. Moreover he said he was ready to abjure all these errors from full conviction.\n\nHe then went on to say: he had been led by the demons to England, France, Germany, and had in Trento, Bergamo, Briren, Verona and in many other cities, together with other sorcerers, attended the gatherings, and again related this all in earnest. Fully in his senses he also told me: We magi and necromancers, when we do not wish to go to such nocturnal assemblies ourselves, then our art teaches us to draw certain necromantic circles, by murmuring a few words, to summon certain demons, and to offer certain adorations to their chief; then we are relieved of being present there and of the labors connected with it, and the demon appears on our behalf. Thus I myself have often acted, by making the circles in my room and adding the rest; yet at other times I have also attended the Sabbath in nearly all the cities of the Venetian territory. \\[Page 33\\]\n\nThe women, however, and the magi of low rank, since they do not possess the higher knowledge, are obliged to appear at every assembly, unless they can produce a sufficient, truly excusing cause. At the third hour of the night the Martinelli assemble; then their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must also be present. Those who come too late or not at all are, wherever they are, struck with illnesses, and are tormented not only during the night of the celebration but also for the following days in body and soul: so that everything they undertake comes to nothing in their hands, until they swear an oath to be more attentive in future.\n\nIn order not to be recognized, the more distinguished and wealthy persons in particular appear covered with a mask, a net, or a veil, which he confirmed by repeated testimony. They would also, for the same reason, not appear under their own proper names. Instead they are called by the names of their native towns, or even of foreign places, with the addition of another place-name, e.g.\u00a0Brescia of Venice, Palatiolum of Milan, when several belonged to the same place.\n\nWhat is told of the pitch-torches at these festivals, of the offerings that each brings, &c.\u00a0he confirmed all from experience; and, asked what he himself sacrificed, he answered: the blood of menstruating women, which the witches of his place supplied to him, and which seemed to be especially pleasing to the demon. He added: the commanding demon of the city where he lives is called Beelzebub; and he has 20,000 demons disposed to every sort of evil under his rule. To himself, however, by virtue of his magical insight, full dominion over the demons had been granted at his will; and he could, by a ring or by some other instrument, bind them and use them for his purposes; but he would neither be used nor forced by them. For all who truly possess magic could, by the power of that art, summon the demons, tame them, make them do their will, and enclose them in rings, vessels, and the like. \\[Page 34\\]\n\nWhen I, says Brognoli, exposed to him the folly of this fancy, he replied one day that he would give me a proof of his power, and by his necromantic circles summon the 30,000 demons that served him. I, for my part, answered: I will for that purpose on the following day, with God's help, preserve myself in the power of Him and of the name of Jesus, to whom sufficient authority and efficacy have been given to put all demons to flight. At that time he lived in the house of the Inquisition, directly beneath the sitting-room of the Inquisitor, Carlo of Velitri. On the following night the latter, as well as one of his friends from the laity, in the room where the magician was alone, heard much speech of the demons; it seemed to come from a great assembled multitude, in which all cried out confusedly, raged in fury, blasphemed God, and boasted how they would do me to death; which they twice attempted that night, yet each time were driven off from my cell by a fear that came over them. By this noise and the shouting which they raised, the Inquisitor and his companion were filled with great terror; and both dared not go to the door of the room in which the magician lived, until I came, and, trusting in divine help, entered the room, and thereby impressed upon him the powerlessness and weakness of the demons. The same was also attested to me by his grown brother, who told me how he had very often heard the voices of many speakers, although the sick man had been alone in the room or in the stable of his house, who, under loud laughter, blasphemed God; which each time caused him the greatest fright.\n\nThe same man, a serious person, also solemnly declared that the brother was heard on almost every night uttering dreadful blasphemies against God, and mocking and deriding Him; which he himself, when I afterwards asked him about it, admitted, adding that he cast them forth in his inward wrath, roused by the violent passion that filled his heart against that young man, and from which he could only free himself by such outbursts. All of that then led directly to atheism, to which several of the magicians with whom he associated daily, according to his own statement, professed themselves.\n\nAll this and his whole remaining behaviour left little hope of his deliverance. I had appointed a day on which he should come to Mass and make the beginning of a sacramental confession. He promised everything; but the demon produced a stiffness and numbness in his body, so that it seemed to him as if it were cold, hard and earthbound; so that he could not stir himself from his bed. After two days I visited him, reproaching him for not having come at the appointed hour. He replied, \"Excuse me, for I cannot rise from the bed nor move from the spot; yet I am content and satisfied and feel no sort of pain.\" When I thereupon commanded the demon not to hinder him, he rose immediately and went to our cloister. But when he wished to confess his sins, there was not the smallest sign of sorrow or inwardness to be perceived in him; which occurred repeatedly over the course of the month. He several times appeared ready to make his confession, and said, \"My offences grieve me in my heart,\" although he was not in a state to show any outward contrition. But hardly had he knelt down when it seemed as if the whole act he performed were entirely empty and altogether irrational; and he said he was aware of no mortal sin. After scarcely begun questioning he already stood up, saying, \"I remember no transgression at all.\" \\[Page 35\\]\n\nOften, when I sought by wholesome exhortations to prepare him for confession, he immediately broke off the conversation and went away, as if someone had urgently summoned him; which he also did frequently with the Inquisitor. When I reminded him to accuse himself of diabolical magic, the invocation of spirits, and other such crimes, he answered: he could not accuse himself of that, because it was an excellent, holy thing worthy of no reproach; he had a pure conscience, unstained by any crime, nor defiled by any vice; and all that he undertook was permitted and right and holy. If, therefore, he had formed a purpose of repentance, the matter was always turned by the demon to the contrary; because his purpose never aimed at God, but at the removal of the bodily evil with which he felt afflicted.\n\nHe told me this often in the words: \"I do not want you to cleanse my conscience by confession; for we magicians and necromancers are all sure of our salvation, and do not need confession; because contrition is sufficient for us, as Peter of Abano teaches us in his writings. I therefore ask only that you free me from the maleficium, should such a thing have struck me.\" Thus he referred everything solely to his bodily health, and no desire arose in him to attend to his spiritual health in order to cure himself of the illness that kept him down. After I had dealt with him for a month he was, for the time being, dismissed home by the Inquisitor. With the increase of this illness he, despairing of any cure, wished to put an end to his own life.\n\nSince he could not leave the bed on which he lay, he incessantly called to those present: Give me a sword or a dagger, with which I can quickly remove myself from the world! Why do I delay any longer? I need only a rope to hang myself. So wills my patron, to whom I have given and devoted myself wholly and entirely; to whom, with body and soul, by virtue of the concluded covenant from which I cannot free myself, I belong! He often made similar speeches, and would have carried them into effect had not someone kept watch over him day and night, as a worthy priest who saw him often at that time testified to me.\n\nIn the year 1667, nineteen years later, when his book was to be printed in Venice, Brognoli asked another priest, who was his countryman, whether he was still alive; and this man replied: I believe so, but I have not seen him for a long time; for years now he has lain bound in chains, naked, covered all over with hair, and entirely without sense. For one day, when he, with some of his companions, outside the city, was performing his necromantic circles to summon the demons, and in some respect erred against his art, the spirits rose up against him and beat him with cudgels all over his body, and especially upon the head, so that he was scarcely carried away half dead by his companions; from those blows he afterwards entirely lost the use of his reason, and became more senseless than an animal. Thus had happened to him what I had often foretold him, when I begged and entreated him to return to sound reason.\n\nIf one considers more closely this horrid mixture of madness, possession and bewitchment, of hellish humor and mockery and irony, one clearly sees the threads of evil deceit, of wicked infernal arts, and of wild, unbridled passions shining through, out of which a demonically impious deed has woven together this tragic story. \\[Page 36\\]\n\nIt falls into the last times of the Thirty Years' War, in which a dreadful barbarization seized upon almost the whole of European society and brought forth the utmost of vileness and abomination, whose miasmas were then carried about everywhere by the undisciplined armies. It was then also this learned doctor of both laws, and thoroughly instructed theologian, whom the pestilential influence seized, and whom they wove into their mysteries in that cave near Genoa. His associates were sorcerers and malefactors, Manichaeans, Anabaptists, Protestants, but above all atheists. Among these, without doubt, all those higher-order questions that moved the times had been discussed, and had led, by divided paths, out into uncertainty.\n\nProtestantism had first awakened doubt, and carried it through all degrees to heathen pantheism, and finally to self-destruction in atheism. The Anabaptists on their part had pointed to mystical routes in order to attain truth in these matters; the malefactors boasted of a practice founded in a world other than the Christian; the Manichaeans promised to unlock this night-covered world, and so the journey to the Genoese cave was undertaken. That the Manichaeans were the ones who played the principal role in the abjuration of the Christian God and the subsequent admission into the fellowship of the evil prince is already shown by the indications of an ordered hierarchy that shine forth from the whole act. There were nine magicians, that is, Manichaeans, who were present at the rite, carrying pitch torches in their hands. Their hidden chief appears in the cave in human form, but wearing the mask of the Goat of Mendes.\n\nThey fall down before him, in the usual fashion paying him homage with the kiss a posteriori. Only the first among them, their bishop, then rises from the midst of those kneeling and brings the novice forward. The Manicheans, as they spread themselves in Italy, had united and ordered themselves under a fully developed hierarchy. From the trial of their adherents which the Inquisition held at the end of the thirteenth century in Ferrara it appears that the sect had bishops in all the principal places --- through the Ferrara, Mantua, Verona, Bergamo, Vicenza districts as far as Romandiola --- several of whom are named, as well as visitators, quaestors and messengers. By the zeal of the Inquisition and the crusades in France the league was broken at the beginning of the fourteenth century, but not exterminated. The ruins withdrew from the light of day and withdrew into the darkness that in any case had been their element; and we still see them so late, in the old holy ninefold of their heads, in that cave, a secret Carbonaria, assembling for recruitment.\n\nBefore the seat of the Master the question of the terms of the pact is now discussed. The desire of the one to be received concerns treasures, invisibility, the serviceability of demons at his command. The Master of the Rock agrees, on his part, on the condition that the initiate renounce God and His Church, and firmly believe that there is no other god than him, the demon. This touched directly upon that question earlier debated among the Genoese. \"The exclusive godhood of the demon contradicts my reason,\" replies the novice, refusing to make such a profession. In truth this doctrine could hardly have pleased Manichaeism, because it rested on the denial of all that is spiritual, and would soon have to threaten even Satan himself in his existence. The chief magician, who was regarded as a bishop among the others, therefore stepped forward as mediator; and although he himself professed that doctrine, he permitted the novice to hold to it at his pleasure so long as he seriously acknowledged the duality of the divine being: one invisible who created spiritual things, and another who created the visible, corporeal things. \\[Page 37\\]\n\nBoth, however, are Manichaean doctrine, as Pfellus found in the last half of the eleventh century among the Euchites or Enthusiasts, a Manichaean sect in Thrace. According to his account these took a Father and two Sons as principles. They left the government of the super-world to the Father; of the sons, the younger had the dominion of the heavenly, the elder that of the underworld. In accordance with this threefold principle they themselves again divided into three parts. Some paid divine veneration to both sons at once, because they were, although often not in agreement, nevertheless children of the same father and would once more be received into grace. Others worshipped the younger only as lord of the higher region, without, however, refusing the older his honor, which they did not withhold for fear of harm from his power. Those among them who attained to the highest godlessness entirely renounced the service of that heavenly one and turned all their veneration to the elder, whom they called Satanaki and the firstborn, alienated from the Father, and acknowledged as the author of plants, animals and all composite bodies, together with all corruption and degeneration. To honor him especially highly, they impute to the heavenly all injustice: he envies his brother and persecutes him, who governs the earthly well, with the bitterest hatred, arousing earthquakes, hailstorms and famine; wherefore they, among all other imprecations, also utter that shameful anathema against him. \\[Page 38\\]\n\nThis Satanaki was also present at the initiation in the cave; how much of that was capricious and how much derived from traditionally transmitted, magically visionary practice cannot be determined from the account. Psellus likewise relates: the demons promised gold, possessions and honours, all of which they were in fact unable to provide. To the initiated they often presented many phantasms and fiery displays of light, which they dared to call theoptia or divine visions; and to obtain these they were obliged to undergo every shameful and abominable thing. He then speaks of the solid and liquid excrements of mankind, which they were bound to taste, because that made the demons favourably disposed toward them. He then explains their secret sacrifice. On the evening of the day on which we celebrate our Lord's Passion they would be brought into a house; there, with lights extinguished, all would intermingle without distinction. After the lapse of nine months they would then meet again in the same place. Four days after the birth the children would be taken from their mothers, all their blood drained off, and they would be burned alive on a pyre; the blood was then mixed with the ashes, and with that they contaminated food and drink, and that was their communion. They believe that thereby the symbols impressed on our soul are driven out and obliterated, so that the demons can gain access to it.1) All their deeds and endeavours are indeed directed to making the demons visible to them.\n\nLater he also speaks of some among them who possessed a prophetic spirit. One of these, speaking of him in an assembly of his own people, once said: \"Know that a man will be sent against us who will persecute our faith and abolish its customs! He will, like many others, put me also in chains; yet, however much he may toil, it will not succeed in bringing me hence bound to Byzantium.\" He described me at that time down to the very countenance, clothing and everything; and that at a time when I had not even passed the suburbs of Byzantium. When I had indeed captured him and asked him whence he had his gift of prophecy, at first he would not answer; but finally, forced to speak, he said that he had learned his arts from a wandering Libyan. This man, he related, led him at night to a mountain, made him taste of an herb, then spat into his mouth, anointed his eyes with an ointment, and caused him to see a multitude of demons, among whom he perceived one that flew toward him in the shape of a raven and entered through his mouth into his entrails. From that time until the present day he could look into the future, as often and in all matters as pleased his demon. Only on the days of the Cross and of the Passion, and on the day of the Resurrection, does he never, even if I wish it, reveal anything to me. But when one of the men struck one of them on the mouth, he said to him, \"You will pay dearly for this one blow!\" and, turning to me, \"but you will suffer much misfortune in your body! For the demons whose service you have overthrown are very hostile to you, and have brought upon you dangers which you will not escape unless a power higher than theirs frees you from them.\" And all came to pass as he had foretold, and I narrowly met death in the many dangers that surrounded me, from which, contrary to expectation, the Redeemer delivered me.\n\nThe ways of the Abomination --- on which, in the deep Orient, they knew how to prepare the sacrament of Hell, under sin and homicide, and the bread of the abyss which, whoever has tasted it, attaches him to the nether-realm and, as we heard elsewhere, never lets him recover --- these ways had also been opened in the peninsula of the West; the deep had foamed its venom into the food, and the unhappy Manichaean had sat at its table. Now the trunk of the good, which springs up in man, had not, as if struck by frost, cast off its green leafy adornment; the axe had not cut away its branches and shortened the trunk itself down to the ground: the stump left behind would then still have been able to put forth new shoots. No --- the last root of what was better had been torn up, the last living germ killed; the higher symbols were all extinguished, and to the dreadful night of death that had now fallen the demons had free access; and the seed of evil, buried down in the depths, could now develop freely.\n\nHe was not possessed, now, in the manner in which possession is commonly understood --- an involuntary entanglement with the hostile power, therefore bound merely in the body; rather the soul had surrendered itself in full deliberation, and from it the body was then occupied with its full knowledge and will. The bird of darkness had flown down through his opened mouth into the depths of his heart, and there, finding already the culpable inclination for that youth, had fastened itself to it and made it the center of his whole being. Thus it was he himself who had committed the evil deed, while his suspicion clung continually to others; just as he, thinking himself the possessor of the demons, became possessed by them. Precisely because a reversal of his whole being had taken place, no notion of his condition remained to him; because no object, not even God, was present to him by which, through comparison, he might find his bearings. The ground of his condition appeared to him good and right, for he believed himself to be perfectly oriented; he was certain of his salvation in it. Only a small flaw disturbed his happiness --- the supposed enchantment with the youth, to which he endeavored to attach all the contradictions into which his perverse state had entangled him with the proper order of things. When, at night, one abyss within him called to another, and a hundred voices spoke blasphemies and vented their despair, then he found in their fury a relief for his flaming passion, and believed that it merely poured itself out there. The bondage of his body when the physician approached him, the grim mocking laugh that burst from him, and the grief that possessed him --- it was all, as he knew, the consequence of his own doing; his caprice, however, had only surrendered to vicissitudes; another power, which continued itself alone in his will, had made the choice.\n\nThis power had bound him with fetters of necessity, and this necessity was not the expression of a power that binds in love under the law of order; but of a violence, hating and destroying in the division of lawlessness, that compelled him to all evil. Thus he was the true canon of a condition that will hereafter meet us more often; a condition that united him intimately with everything that in any way created evil on earth. \\[Page 39\\]\n\nHe therefore attended all the Sabbaths of the brethren, but with the unboundness of a high magnate of the realm, coming and going according to his pleasure, as it pleased him. It was therefore no wonder that Brognoli's efforts failed on an honorable man in whom reason had become counter-reason, conscience an uncertainty, the whole spirit a mere madness. His end, in which, it is to be believed, his comrades took part, was therefore also --- with the complete extinguishing of the last spark of intellect --- the outbreak of a raging beast, which vented itself upon its chain"}, "The Possession of a Jewish Woman in Ferrara": {"start_char": 132944, "end_char": 133119, "pages": "40", "keywords": ["- of jewish woman in ferrara"], "verbatim": "d spoke came from Samael.

Others, who came along another road, heard in a sweet voice the 93rd Psalm begin to be sung; so that they stood still until the singers had finished.

That in these valleys the whole activity was likewise connected with the heresies, and that action against the evil, when it was shown by an impartial and dispassionate inquiry, had the mass of the people on its side, is shown by the following remarkable account which Giussano has preserved for us in the Life of Saint Borromeo. \\[Page 77\\]\n\nThe valley of Mesolcina, which belongs to Graub\u00fcnden, was, at the time of this archbishop, besides the heresies and other evils already recounted, also filled with those who practiced malefices and witchcraft with the help of the demon, to whom the abandoned wholly surrendered themselves, and who now committed great and intolerable wicked deeds. By their sorceries and malignities they harmed both people and beasts; for they not only brought various sicknesses upon adults and children, but even sentenced them to death: and it happened that people and whole herds threw themselves down from the mountains; which caused the populace great distress and harm, all the more because they could find no remedy. In that year 1583 the communities therefore assembled the common council of the valley to discuss measures by which the evil might be remedied; and those assembled resolved to take refuge with the archbishop and to beg him that he would grant them counsel and assistance in this matter. They therefore sent some of the principal persons of the valley to Milan to lay the commission before him, and they were received by him very kindly; and, rejoicing that God was opening the way for him to be active in the service of these communities, he kindly promised them his assistance; and he offered to go personally into the valley in order better to learn of the situation and to take precautions for what was necessary. With this he dismissed them comforted.\n\nHe then considered the importance of this affair very maturely and cautiously, and judged it necessary first to send a judge under the name of an Inquisitor, who would, within the bounds of justice, initiate the inquiry against the malefices and witchcraft. For this task he chose Francesco Borsatto, a famous Mantuan jurist who had shortly before put on the clerical habit; and, drawn by the public reputation of the archbishop, had come to Milan to receive the holy orders from his hand and to learn in his school the practice of ecclesiastical discipline. Borsatto carried out the necessary investigations with great prudence and agility. He found almost the entire region infected by witchcraft; and, what is worse, he discovered that the provost of this valley himself, who resided in the collegiate church of Rovereto, was as it were the head and leader, after he had transformed himself from a shepherd into a ravening wolf. He therefore instructed the judicial processes, and conducted them with so much humanity and goodwill that he won all hearts, and was then able to dispose of all things according to his judgment.\n\nThese wise efforts proved very useful for the visit the Cardinal wished to make there, and served as the best preparation for greater matters. But since the Holy Man knew with what caution one must proceed, how fiercely one must contend with the infernal enemy, and what difficulty commonly presents itself in the destruction of evil diabolical arts, and still more of damned heresies, he deemed it necessary, after having in accordance with his custom first taken refuge in prayer, to choose some men distinguished by kindness and learning to assist him in various functions in his undertaking. Among these were Father Francesco Pignarola, a Milanese noble and very celebrated preacher, who afterwards became Bishop of Asti; Father Achilla Gagliardi of the Society of Jesus, a man of great authority and experience and an exceedingly learned theologian; and lastly Bernardino Morra, his general auditor, who was afterwards made Bishop of Aversa by Clement VIII, after he had in the most honorable manner endured many hardships for the Church. \\[Page 78\\]\n\nAfter he had put all these matters in order, he left Milan at the beginning of November and went to settle in Rovereto, the chief town of the valley, where he was received with jubilation by the people there, from which he drew great hope for blessed fruits. When Borsatto had finished the instruction of the processes, he reported to the bishop. Since the latter now knew that people of that sort are very hard to advise, on account of the special friendship and the close contracts into which they had entered with the devil, he therefore tried, with great patience (supported in this by his subordinates), every means so that the bound ones might see their grievous errors, renounce the devil and his false arts, and turn their hearts to God. His efforts were not in vain; for he converted a sufficient number of them; at one time he was able to obtain more than 150 abjurations, who then confessed to him and received communion. Eleven old witch-women, the leaders of the others, who had wholly given themselves over to the devil, and who perhaps no longer deserved God's mercy on account of the exceedingly grave offenses they had committed against Him, remained hardened in their sin; and since all effort with them was in vain, they were delivered over to the secular arm and punished with death by fire.\n\nThe same obduracy was shown by the provost of Rovereto, who was the head of that wicked sect; and however much the cardinal and his subordinates labored, they could never soften that seduced heart to a true recognition of its faults. Therefore, out of obedience to the holy canons, they found themselves compelled to proceed, by public act, to his degradation, an act accompanied by the cardinal's tears and deepest sorrow; in which he also delivered a sermon to the people lamenting the offender in person, and expressed his oral regret that he was compelled by the command of the law to an act so far removed from his mercy and clemency. \"You see, my sons,\" thus began the sermon, \"the decision of the holy Church against her servants who have made themselves unworthy of ecclesiastical service;\" and he then went on to show how unwillingly the Church, as the mildest of mothers, has recourse to such decisions. It cannot be told what care he took for the conversion of the heretics as well as for cleansing the people of their superstition; for he had spent much time in making these persons receptive of the truth. Even with the lowliest he showed the utmost patience, although some proved themselves most obstinate and gave him exceedingly unseemly answers. He did not, however, act as if he felt it, but persisted in his long-suffering and zeal to gain their souls for God. In this way he reformed that entire valley and"}, "The Shape-Shifting Sorcerers of German Switzerland": {"start_char": 262436, "end_char": 263395, "pages": "79", "keywords": ["- in german switzerland"], "verbatim": "\nBut the German Switzerland was at the same time also seized by it, and Nider mentions an entire succession of reputed sorcerers in that region who, judging by their names, were of Teutonic stock.

Soon afterwards one evening, when I went from the room into the cellar, I saw a toad on long thin legs as if coming from the door; but when, frightened, I called the household together, we found nothing. The following night my youngest child gave a terrible scream, and when the maid lighted a lamp to look after him, she herself went pale and said: the demon had attacked her; she therefore fell ill from that time on, so that we had to hire another maid for her service for half a year. My little eight-year-old daughter then suddenly ran, frightened and crying, to her father: she dared not sleep in the children's room, for at nightfall there always came a strong man, in a silk garment, with a mustache and frightful eyes, before whom she was terribly afraid. We scolded her for her timidity, and she had to go to bed. But when her father had left her, she broke out into great weeping and screaming; we hastened to her, and found her deathly pale. She then became ill, and caused food and drink to be expelled again through her lips; yet she afterwards recovered.\n\nSoon after my husband had to travel to Germany, and two weeks after his departure a great terror came upon our house. A young man, called Jakob, a nephew of my husband, began to be beset with fear by the spirit of temptation. For when he went to bed at evening he began to lament and to cry, and said he could not sleep in his room because of the demon and the ghosts. So we made his bed in ours; but when he lay down there he began again to bewail himself; and when we ran to him his whole bed trembled; and the boy's eyelids were so widely torn apart that they could not be closed or brought together by anyone; his mouth, however, was so tightly shut that no one could open it. After he at last came to himself and began to speak, we asked him how he was. He answered: God knows it; to me it is unknown. At last sleep came over him, so that he rested the remainder of the night, and slept until the tenth hour on the following day. On rising, however, he looked so corpse-pale and emaciated that it was a terror to all. That evening, as he stood at the table during supper, I said to him: Take something to eat, Jakob! Lie down, and commend yourself to God's protection, so that you do not again behave as on that accursed night, whereby we all were thrown into terror, and finally must leave the house! As I spoke these words, the doors of the chamber and the kitchen were torn open of themselves, and so violently that they struck against the walls; the youth, however, was torn from the room into the hall, where he was raised two ells high into the air, hanging suspended; without anyone present who supported him or held him aloft. His arms were stretched up, his eyes wide open, his mouth drawn together, his chin twitched up and down as if it were about to be torn off. \\[Page 82\\]\n\nWe tried with all our strength, grasping him by hands and feet, to pull the one hovering down; but the limbs hung so motionless that we could not even shift him or move him from the spot. We therefore all, kneeling in the hall, called to God that He would remember His mercy. Then the youth was released and set again upon the ground. But his mouth was still closed so that he could not speak, until we made him vomit with a silver spoon. Then he sighed, and his tongue was loosened, and his speech restored; and when we asked him how he was, he said: I hope that, with God's help, I will now grow better; for when you called to God on your knees, he went away, and moved from the well to the wood-pile. When I asked, \"Who has gone?\" he answered, \"Satan.\" When I further asked whether he had then bound himself to Satan, he burst into tears and said, \"You do me a great wrong, mother, in holding me capable of such a crime; my years have not taught me such things!\"\n\nWhile he spoke thus, a great noise was heard in the entry-hall, and a monstrous voice was heard, which however no one understood. The young man said: it is the voice of Satan, who speaks with him. At that moment a great fire flared up in the entry-hall, running about here and there. The young man said: Satan had spat the fire from his throat. We then took him into the room and read to him from God's Word until two o'clock after midnight, whereupon sleep at last came upon him, which lasted until the eleventh hour the next morning. He was, however, soon assailed again, and the terrors in our house increased day by day; all the more because I kept the matter secret until my husband's return. Of him Satan said: he had dogged him for fourteen years, but on account of the great man (so he used to call God), whose assistance he invokes day and night, I could do nothing against him; instead of him you are now delivered to me! The young man wept as he told this, and lamented that he had ever set foot in Denmark; for he was a German, and his temptation by Satan grew worse and worse thereafter.\n\nAt times he crucified him, bowing his head and crossing his feet one over the other, as Christ is represented on the cross: then no one could bend him, or move him from the spot, or alter his stance and appearance; he turned the whites of his eyes outward as if he were dead. At last my blessed husband returned home, and was informed of what had occurred. He caused prayers to be said for us in the town and the neighboring churches. He appointed the three successive Sundays as days of penance for the whole household, on which none, neither man nor beast, should eat or drink anything.\n\nOn the first of those days it was as if Satan would force in the windows, and the young man wailed that he would carry him off through the open window; the Evil One also appeared to some as a raven, to others as a goose. --- For a month the afflicted one had not slept soundly; now he began to enjoy some rest and awoke cheerful; likewise nothing had occurred in the house during the whole night, and the awakened man related that during the night his angels had told him he would get better. Yet he announced at eleven in the evening the return of the Evil One, who indeed appeared and remained with him until Easter. \\[Page 83\\]\n\nNo place in our house was in the meantime free of spectres; to some of the household he appeared in the likeness of Mr.\u00a0Johannes Knuse of Karslund, or of H. Mathias in Herf\u00f6gle; to others in that of a merchant, a dog, or a pig. The face and hands of some swelled so that they were no longer recognizable. Our children cried out and lamented at his appearing. One, only two years old, tore at his hair and pointed with his finger to the spot, crying, \"There! there he is!\" Jacob usually felt his approach in advance, and then urged us to remove the boys. The maid of our neighbour I. Mejer had once also come here with her master's boy; Jacob had warned her, but she had refused to heed the warning; her face and hand swelled up so that she was no longer recognizable. We had taken in a poor woman in the evening; but the enemy, appearing in the form of a local burgher, so frightened her that she could not compose herself. \\[Page 84\\]\n\nA little white puppy lay in our parlor; it was lifted by the head and struck against the floor, though no one was visible who could have held it. It then hid itself under the bench, and was drawn out from beneath it by the head, and, resisting with its hindquarters, was dragged along the floor. The next morning it was frantic, tried to bite everyone who came to visit us; and we were obliged to kill it. When at last the time came in which the tormented young man was to be freed, he rose in bed and wrestled with Satan, using God's Word for the conflict; he recited many prayers that the neighbors we had summoned listened to; finally he lifted his hands to heaven and cried out: Now be God praised, who has delivered me from Satan! Then, turning to the other side, he extended his hand to someone we did not know and said: Hail to you, angel who standest at the right hand of God; forsake me now never, whether I travel by water or by land! He spoke other such words, reached out his hand again after kissing it; then wrapped himself in his blanket so that we saw nothing but the crown of his head; and we heard him, like a small boy with a clear voice, sing: Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth to men of good will. Now he rose up, and was completely well again; before, without our help he could do nothing, so bent and contracted was he, and he could not straighten himself up; henceforth he felt nothing more of all that affliction, and we were joyful and all thanked God.\n\nBut God, in his unfathomable counsels, sought to visit us even more harshly. My husband now began to be assailed day and night, harder than anyone can imagine; namely from eleven o'clock in the morning and evening until two o'clock after noon and after midnight. It began when I had stayed at home from the Sunday service because of a boy's illness; thereupon such a terror seized us all that we altogether fell upon benches and chairs, or upon the floor. We came to ourselves again, and after we had prayed the evil vanished again. The maids and the children, however, again saw apparitions; and my husband, who had already been sorrowful for three weeks, became all the more downcast when he learned of it. Once, when I adjured him by God to at least tell how he was, he collapsed; and when he came to himself again he said: God, who is always gracious and merciful to those who call on him, may he also be mindful of me and of ours, and bring us help! So sorely am I pressed by Satan day and night that heaven and earth seem to lie upon me with their weight. You will not long have me with you further as a husband, and my children will soon be orphans. From that time on he was harried more and more fiercely; according to his account something lay upon him daily at that hour like a sack of fruit; and at times swellings, as large as hen's eggs, would break out at his side. I again had prayers held in the churches, and also drove by carriage out to Mr.\u00a0Johannes in the parish of Norderup to solicit his assistance. But when, on my return, I entered a wood the carriage became so heavy that the horses could scarcely move it; the trees crashed about us, something as high as a tower rose up before us, and a dreadful voice was heard which we could not understand. When I, having come home, went to bed and, my right hand bowed over my head, fell asleep, it was as if a mouse were gnawing my finger. However I cried and for a quarter of an hour tried to pull the finger to me, I could not; the finger seemed dislocated to me, and although nothing could be seen on it, yet I could not move it for a whole month. \\[Page 85\\]\n\nOn the following night, when I lay in bed with my husband, a heat seized us, as if the bed were standing in flames; so that we could not sleep. But when we rose the next morning, there lay on the lower sheet, from the pillow to the feet, a hanging of filth, two and two as masses united in a link of the chain, as if they had been strung on a thread, and so numerous that one could scarcely see the sheet beneath them. Our neighbors looked on this in amazement. Ingeburg, the wife of Mejer, who had come over, heard a loud laugh but saw no one. When she, frightened, withdrew again, my husband fainted. We brought him to bed, and sat in the front room until the ninth hour; but when I then wished to go to bed, he was no longer in it, and at last we found him in a small room, weeping and lamenting. This continued until it finally ended as the whole affair had begun: in my husband's head-pillow, into which the spirit had thrown itself, and from whose lower side, when it was removed, it had torn a piece out of the covering so that the feathers flew about the whole room. My husband was then freed.\n\nWhen we gave thanks to God for this deliverance in the churches, our nine-year-old son fell ill.\u00a0Yet we could not fathom his sickness; he said something living ran through his body, gnawing at him here and there. We tried baths and other remedies, but he grew worse. A surgeon we consulted likewise could give no explanation, and directed us to a woman versed in healing who at that time visited our town. She said the boy was possessed, and that nothing would help but prayer. Meanwhile, as the boy lay in his willow-woven bed, the bed together with him was lifted two ells into the air and was moved hither and thither. When I therefore called my husband, the boy had meantime been pulled out of the bed and stood on his head, his feet turned upward and his hands outstretched; so that we could hardly get him back into bed. Something continued to run through him; his body sometimes swelled horribly, his tongue was thrust out of his mouth, and then again was wound up like a cloth, while blood pressed through his lips. His limbs were drawn so together that four strong men were not enough to pull them apart. He grunted like a pig, clucked like a cock, and howled like a dog. At times it carried the boy onto the beams of our room, or on a pile of wood, and left him there; so that he did not know where he was and wept bitterly. It also threw him over the wall into the gateway of our neighbor Mejer. Sometimes it drew his eyes and cheeks so far back into his head that they were no longer visible. The boy became rigid like a log, and we set him up in this condition against the wall, where he then stood motionless like a statue; so that even the most hard-hearted were moved to tears at the sight of him.\n\nOnce, when I myself was at the evening sermon on a Sunday, it ill-treated my mother, who had stayed at home; the spirit, taking my likeness, pulled her shoes from her feet and struck her with them. She therefore received me on my return home weeping and with bitter reproaches. Although women the next day assured her to the contrary, she could scarcely be persuaded until the spirit, speaking from the boy's mouth, told my husband about it, adding: Had the Great One permitted it, I would have treated her so that the whole town would have wept for her. When we in the evening prayed the 46th Psalm, he neighed like a horse to it; he spat upon my husband's face so that it ran into his beard. He placed bare knives upon my breast; but when I said he should strike in the name of Jesus, the knives fell to the floor. He said to my husband: Be not too hasty, you will not drive me from here until those who brought me here receive their deserved reward! That is the will of the great man; even if I am a liar, he at times compels me to tell the truth. I would wish the time were already come when I could leave the house. When my husband asked when that time would come, he answered: Only that great man knows, not I.\n\nMy husband, after having borne so much himself and for his family, was now delivered from all misery; he himself passed to the other life, and left me alone, entangled in combat with the raging enemy, who would not cease to speak from the boy's mouth. The affliction continued for two years after my husband's death. Magister Glostrup held prayers for us in the church, often came to our house, spoke with Satan, and reproved him harshly. He also tried to speak with him in Latin; but the reply was: he would not burden his head with Latin. At last God would not permit him to continue his persecutions; he had to desist, and our house became as free from spectres as it had been before --- for which may the holy Name of God be praised, who does not abandon His own in their distress. I have written this down as a memorial of what happened in our house, and it contains, so help me God! the pure truth.\n\nThis is also known to M. N. Glostrup, then our pastor, now Bishop of Opfloe; likewise to P. von Duebrodere, Bartolo Foannis; to Peter Mann in Ferse, to the pastor Jakob in Nordrup, Caspar in Roeschild, Lorenz in Liemarch, Nicolaus in Vallensby --- several of whom still live, others are already dead. Magister Nicolaus had the boy in his house for half a year; the boy afterwards recovered, once the authors of our misfortune had expiated their guilt, and lived until the year 1620, when the great mortality carried him off.\n\nOne might, on reading this account, imagine that every member of that worthy family went mad in turn; but it would not be proper to attribute the participation of all the named pastors to the influenza as well. The censor of the book, Fan Berharod, who, after reading it, believes it will help to confirm Scripture's teaching about demons, likewise must not have escaped the contagion. Then there are the two burgomasters of the town, father and son, and the senator Pomeyer, who officially and before God declare to the author Brunsmann that there is no reason to suspect fraud in what is contained in the woman's report; that they have had the truth of the matter confirmed by their predecessors, and that it also appears as such in their records, which they have placed at his disposal; they too must be regarded as having suffered from the same malady.\n\nThe circle of this strange mental disorder grows still wider when one reads the extracts Brunsmann has made from these records. The householder Barscher had taken suspicion of the authors of the mischief in his house, and this suspicion had fallen upon Johanna Thomana, with whom he had formerly been in business relations --- relations he broke off when she was accused, by Christina Capserin (who had been executed for witchcraft), of being implicated. Her grievance had been increased when he had pre-purchased a house on which she had bid. For this reason he had taken an advocate, and by him caused the suit to be prosecuted before the town council. The investigation was instituted and carried out; on 8 June 1612 sixteen judges of guilt were appointed at the Ting of K\u00f8ge, who are named in the records. They were charged to pronounce only such judgment as, according to the laws, they could justify before God and men. From 8 June until the 3rd... \\[Page 86\\]\n\nThe trial lasted through August, during which the lay judges, their hands laid upon the Holy Scripture, declared: As we desire---may God and His holy Word prosper us for good and for salvation---so in this matter we could find nothing otherwise than that Johanna Thomana had been the cause of the mistreatment of the servant in the service of the merchant Johannes, who is reported as possessed; and we can see and discern nothing else than that she is in truth guilty of diabolical sorcery. She confessed, and was executed on 11 September. One sees that the lay judges had judged according to their conscience; and one must believe that they had previously verified all the factual circumstances that underlay the case. Whether, however, they judged rightly in attributing the evil --- that is, the objective influences --- absolutely to that cause, is another question which we shall consider later in general"}, "The Torment of the Three Brothers from Rheinbischofsheim": {"start_char": 288438, "end_char": 306342, "pages": "87-91", "keywords": ["the torment of the three brothers from rheinbischofsheim"], "verbatim": "sition into the next consideration.\n\nIn Holy Week, 1836, three brothers of Protestant confession came from Rheinbischofsheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden --- Jakob, David and Friedrich --- bearing a letter from a Catholic parish priest from the Lower-Rhine Alsace, who recommended them for exorcistic treatment because they, their younger sister, and their whole household were continually tormented by evil spirits. From the conversations I had with the three young men in consequence, roughly the following emerged. Descended from common peasant parents and occupied from youth with agricultural work, they had always been healthy and strong. The eldest, Jakob, learned the smith's trade; the second, David, entered service in the army; the third, Friedrich, always remained at home. While Jakob was still abroad, David was one time seized by a very strange condition: he felt as if blown upon by a wind, and such a compression arose on his chest that he began to spit up blood. He was medically treated and was sent to the hospital in Karlsruhe; but all remedies applied were in vain, and he finally received his discharge. Arrived at home, his condition was not at all better, and at the same time extremely strange things happened in the house and in the stable. At the same time Jakob, while abroad, had begun to perceive what was going on in the paternal home; and now the younger brother Friedrich soon also began to be tormented, just like David; and also a younger sister, though not to the same degree as the brothers. In the house there were intermittent rumblings and bangs in a dreadful manner, and in the stable the cattle perished in an unnatural way. When the brothers went across the fields or drove with the cart, stones were often thrown at them from the air. Sometimes, they said, a thunderstorm suddenly stood up in the clearest sky; and on several occasions an unknown animal walked ahead of them and then, at a certain spot, suddenly vanished. \\[Page 87\\]\n\nPhysically Jacob suffered little, but he was a kind of visionary, and saw, as he said, the fiends coming. A moment later the brothers would be as if smitten by a breath, and feel an inner motion that increased to the point of hemorrhage; yet so that, when the attack had passed, they felt their strength restored, as if they had never lacked anything. Often it seemed to them as if they were beaten by invisible but still palpable hands; often as if they were pierced through the belly. They ascribed these things neither to the devil nor to actual spectres, but to wicked people. The seer insisted that he had positively recognized the apparitions as persons still living and even related to them; and the strangest stories were adduced in proof.\n\nThey had at the outset sought diverse medical help, but found none anywhere; what wonder, since they sought to drive out sorcery by sorcery, and went to those who were reputed to practice such arts. These assisted them on several occasions by sympathetic means, but only for a short time; because, as they alleged, the helpers were better paid by the others. What opinion I should draw from all these accounts as to the real ground of the matter I did not know. I regarded the two younger brothers, David and Friedrich, as hysterical; for their condition, especially that of the latter, pointed to a high degree of suffering. They otherwise appeared to be anything but timid, superstitious people; so that, since I noted they were Protestants --- among whom such things, especially in that district, occur even more than among Catholics --- I was inclined to ascribe the whole affair to a play of the imagination; yet on the other hand their calm narration, their ingenuous answers to embarrassing questions which I put to them, utterly disabused me of that view.\n\nAfter I had at last deliberated, and after I had to some extent explained to them the meaning of the church benediction, I gave this to them repeatedly once or twice a day. They testified that they felt easier, indeed they seemed entirely free from their plague. I therefore dismissed them in Easter week with a letter to the pastor who had sent them to me; in which I begged him, in consideration of my ignorance concerning the true nature of the affair, to make on the spot inquiries into the relations of the family, into the circumstances of the people among whom they had been raised, and in general into everything that might throw light on the matter; also himself, notwithstanding the general prohibition of exorcism, at least to employ the exorcismum probativum.\n\nAt the beginning of June the brothers, to my no small astonishment, returned a second time and brought with them a letter from the pastor, who wrote that he himself had gone to their parental house in Bischofsheim; that he had there examined and investigated all the circumstances, but had discovered nothing significant as to the cause of the matter. He had had the brothers examined by physicians, and these, as the enclosed certificates showed, had detected no bodily disease. Twice he had written to the Vicar General for permission to perform the exorcism; but the latter had only answered evasively. He had now blessed the house, and it had indeed been freed from all haunting; the half-dead cattle were now well too; only the three brothers continued to be tormented, and he therefore repeatedly begged me to apply the exorcism. The medical testimonies ran as follows --- first, that of Dr.\u00a0K\u00fchn: the three brothers had, several years before, suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage and had been treated by him; but the prescribed remedies had been without effect, because the causes of the ailment could not be sufficiently ascertained. \\[Page 88\\]\n\nSecondly, that of the physician Humann in Herrlisheim, who declared that he had examined the brothers stethoscopically, but had found nothing in them that pointed to an organic defect of the sick person, or to a physiological disturbance of the functions of her body as a whole. The brothers, once they reached me, now assured me that when they had left here on their earlier departure they had remained free of all attacks for two days; upon which, however, the evil had returned, and they were again as before in distress. During their previous absence everything at home had been topsy-turvy; there had been terrible noise, and all the cattle in the stable had seemed as if they were about to die. The distraught father had at once run to the Catholic pastor for help; but since he was prevented from assisting personally he had given him blessed palms; and when these were burned in the stable the animals immediately became healthy and rose up well.\n\nThe pastor had afterwards come and blessed the house again, whereupon nothing adverse had occurred since. Only they themselves suffered from the old malady, and begged me piteously to help them, since they firmly believed I could. I had therefore to return to the work, whether I wished to or not, which weighed on me greatly because of the obscurity of the whole affair. I had them tell their stories again, I asked fresh questions, I had them set their answers down in writing; but I could come to no foundation, any more than the first time. Their accounts partly confirmed what had been stated earlier, and partly added new details.\n\nI have again forgotten many things; I will therefore set down only some of what I have written from Jakob before me. He wrote: when he was yet away in foreign parts, a man often came to his workshop by day and by night who showed him how matters stood at home; he always demanded that Jakob should throw money to him, and he would show him what he could do. If Jakob then wished to leave, he could not stir from the spot; nevertheless he was not otherwise prevented from working. The matter soon took a worse turn: the visitors became more numerous; they planned all sorts of things with him, and forced him to swear at night; he often had to carry coffins, was himself laid into them, or had to dig up corpses. They crucified him; but when it was over it appeared that it had been nothing.\n\nNaked women appeared, carried out all manner of mischief with the others, sat on his face, etc., whereupon he then had actual pollutions. They would also have carried him off, it was to him as if he went out through his own eyes, and they led him to games and debauchery. They showed him how they had poisoned the well-water at home, and promised that if he married one of them they would make it right again. Thus it went on as in madness, and when the apparitions presently threatened to devour him, shot at him with pistols, beat him, tore one another's hair, then again came driving up with carriages and horses; another time a man loaded with golden and silver chains would appear and two golden rings would be placed about his arms; when they then rode with him into the clouds, climbed Mount Sinai, gave him nine golden keys, made three garments, set up a white bed before him; meanwhile again firing cannons, making music, launching an assault on Paradise, and desolating and destroying all things --- who could be wise after all that? He complained that these phantasms appeared to him almost every night; whereupon, every time, certain afflictions befell the other brothers. \\[Page 89\\]\n\nHe also wrote much about this, from which, however, likewise nothing rational could be drawn; the assertion remained steadfast: the principal persons were close relatives; among others, the father's sister, a notorious woman, with her equally notorious daughter. It was precisely this latter who was to marry Jakob --- but he did not want her. Even their own pastor was said to have been among the fiends. The thought occurred to me: since that notorious aunt had christened all three of them, perhaps the first cause of the evil had been laid then; and for that reason I renewed with them the baptismal vows. I continued to pray with them, instructed them about the churchly benediction, and pronounced it over them.\n\nAt last I resolved also to speak the exorcism contra maleficia over them. I can cite nothing remarkable of its striking effects; for the fact that Friedrich once or twice perspired under it, so that the sweat fell in drops, could well be explained by his suffering state. They likewise assured me this time: after each prayer over them they felt lighter, but it would come back again anew every day; it already brought relief when they were even only in the convent. They always thought: if I took it to the highest degree, it would surely be better, it would be altogether well. Almost three weeks thus passed, but no thorough help had been attained; the people's money ran out, and by their long absence from home the accumulating tasks demanded their presence ever more urgently; I could not and would not detain them for a single moment with empty promises. I therefore dismissed them with a letter to the pastor, in which I communicated to him everything that had occurred, and how I had never found a sure sign of a demonic influence. That the exorcism had remained without effect might well be due to the fact that the young people lived outside communion with the church; this defect could indeed have been supplied by my faith and my trust; but since that is only a divine gift which God bestows on whom He will, no one could accuse me on account of the lack of success. A magnetic treatment by a reliable and religious physician might perhaps be advisable in this case; the pastor himself might also, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, privately, and without telling the people what was going on, apply the exorcism.\n\nThey went away with this advice, and the narrator, when he wrote this down, had heard nothing further of them since. One must regret that this story could only be observed so incompletely and with so many gaps; for, had it been followed on the spot with attentive eyes for the requisite time, it would have afforded a profound insight into the nature of a most wondrous condition. As it stands, it appears as a popular, and, as one can hardly doubt, sincere report on the modalities of a disposition as it often occurs in witchcraft; and although it lacks sharpness of observation and the investigation of all the circumstances that occurred, it nevertheless, intelligible to a physiological tact, affords many revelations.\n\nIt becomes clear from this account: the house of these people, with everything that was bound to it in some relation, has been transferred out of the natural state in which it previously was into a counter-natural one; in which other laws than those of ordinary life prevail. In the midst of this new condition stand, to begin with, the three brothers, who had previously been healthy and strong, but are now reduced to a hectic appearance; and to them the younger sister attaches herself in the first instance. All are united to one another in a physiological bond, and within it stand in reciprocal interaction. \\[Page 90\\]\n\nIn this association --- and thus also drawn into the shared suffering --- is also the household's stock of cattle; which, so to speak placed at the circumference of the sphere of action, nevertheless, according to the testimony of the pastor, takes part in everything that occurs within it. Within the house itself things happen that wholly belong to the domain of haunting, and, however one may explain them, they show that this domain has been pushed to the border of two spheres. At the apex of the solidaristic connection stands the first-born; against his will he has become clairvoyant, farsighted and foreseeing; he therefore sees through the whole relationship that attaches itself to him as the members to the head.\n\nImmediately beneath him stand the two brothers, again placed like members to the central organ; they are not seeing themselves, but when he becomes seeing they appear affected; they are, in relation to his knowledge of their condition, as if breathed upon, and are at once seized by an illness in which this knowledge becomes real in them. Congestions of the lungs appear which end in bleeding from the lungs; whereby, after the termination of the attack, as in all maladies of this kind, the powers rapidly restore themselves. The younger sister is also, though less deeply, drawn into this relation of action and reaction; the cattle, as if struck by the outermost emanations, give notice of their participation by rapid falling ill and recovery; and the haunting stirs itself each time as well, and seems to form the medium in which all those effects occur.\n\nYet the first impulse of the movement by no means proceeds from the centre of the association, and the knowledge of the deed is not realised by the deed alone; rather this realisation also comes to it from elsewhere. Even the clairvoyance Jacob possesses is not entirely his own; there is a man who comes to him and shows him things as they occur. He finds himself bound and held by its power, although it does not prevent his work. It seeks to master him, and employs against him alternately terror and bribery. Desire too it makes its ally; involuntary sympathy it is able to extract from him, only the accession of the will is lacking; and yet all this likewise shows, as the crucifixion does, finally as a haunting.\n\nOpposed to the household association there thus stands another association, which actually effects the realisation, and this association is of demonic nature, its head being that objective apparition; for even the church's actio in distans opposes it and hinders its effect. The members who belong to this counter-association stand in a certain relation to the house itself; it is the ill-famed woman who took the brothers through baptism; it is the pastor who baptized them; it is the woman's daughter who suggests marriage to the seer, and who draws him out with her own eyes, as she had previously bound him, and leads him to play and feasting.\n\nFrom this counter-association, then, issues the realisation of what is seen; it is the hostile demonic principle that works in it, and it is by no means strictly necessary that its members be aware of the particulars of the matter. They need only, perhaps by their moral demeanour, stand to that principle in an ethically sympathetic relation of some depth: and this principle can, by virtue of the will-less natural force that lives in them, make use of them as instruments to exercise its effects through them; as the like may happen through any natural mischief. Just as this kind of evil, exercised by the haunt-spirits in the frightful manifestations, nakedly comes to light; so, in those fable-like ghostly proceedings, the haunting has only entered into these persons and has personified itself in them. Thus the whole points only to an order of things higher and more intensified than that in which the foregoing phenomena stood. \\[Page 91\\]\n\nThere have occurred there the spooky (spukhaften) events, without their actual inner cause having come into view. Here this perception, as clairvoyance bound to the disposition, found itself appended. Now the thus-perceived world presses upon the seer, so that he who hitherto has behaved passively will now also put his will into it, and truly unite himself with it. He resists with all his might, but give such a disposition likewise the perverse will that meets the impulse, and one will fully understand that a tacit or express compact may come to pass. Merely for this reason, because the episode marks a moment of the advance on the path of deepening into the region of night, we have inserted it here, notwithstanding the fragmentary and obscure character in which it has remained for want of keen observation. If the natural disposition is lacking, then it will, in the further advance along the road of evil, be artificially evoked by those natural stimuli of whic"}, "The Piacenza Man's Witches' Sabbath": {"start_char": 307955, "end_char": 310333, "pages": "92-93", "keywords": ["high magnate status at witches' sabbath", "witch trials"], "verbatim": "as Prierias has preserved it, cannot be passed over here.\n\nAfter the author in the first book had established the possibility of demonic influence in an Aristotelian fashion, and the reality by means of the Malleus, he relates at the beginning of the second book: A marvelous event was wont, as experienced by himself, to be told by a resident of Piacenza; who, if he has not recently died, still belongs as a Benedictine monk to the congregation of St.\u00a0Justina, and there bears the name Jerome. This man, then still worldly, had a love affair with a girl whom he had won with the help of a sorceress; in return for this the sorceress had him promise to attend the Sabbath. She contrived it, however, in such a way that he kept his promise. Naked, he anointed himself between the hand and the arm with a certain salve which she had given him, making at the same time a certain sign which she had taught him. The same was done by the teacher and by the girl whom he had already abused. \\[Page 92\\]\n\nAll three were at once lifted up and carried away through an opening in the roof; and he, as it seemed to him, was sitting on a swift horse. Thus they reached the walnut tree of Benevento, and indeed with such speed that the quickly cleft air sounded about them with a sharp noise. Beneath the tree thousands were gathered; a scant light illuminated the scene, and they amused themselves in many ways. After the merriment had ended the witness returned by the same way home, and on the journey he saw many rivers and places, among which he especially noted Venice, which he had never before seen; and later, when he visited it, he recognized again what he had seen in that vision, which also occurred to him with other places. Having returned home, he was---after he had indulged in the pleasure with the girl---horrified at what he had done; and either kindly by nature, or because God had mercy on him, he confessed everything that had happened to the bishop or his vicar, and returned to the Church; who then received him into that order in which he probably even now leads a pious life.

At times he stole something from her, especially bread which she either had with her or had laid elsewhere. Whenever the bread portions --- the people were poor --- were set down, it was always the portion that fell to the girl, and no other, that was taken, and most often the stolen thing was brought back as if in jest. The same happened with other things that belonged to her. But the girl was ashamed of this game, and so were her parents; for they mistrusted the outcome.

One man was struck from above by a hammer; another by a flying brick --- however, everything so lightly that whatever fell seemed to have lost its weight and therefore caused no pain. All wondered at this; some were seized by fear, thinking readily that something supernatural was afoot. Only the smith's maid, named Anna Bayerin, who served there as nurse to the child, laughed and said that she feared nothing and that no harm would come of it to her. Clergy were called to bless the house and to free it from the devil's assaults; but there was no remedy until the said maid was ordered to leave. As soon as she was out of the house, it became quiet again. These occurrences, and new disturbances which took place in another house where she passed the night, caused the local magistrate to have the more respectable citizens sworn concerning the facts, and thereafter to order the imprisonment of that maid. I do not wish to defend the interrogations made of her to the hair, or to claim that they were entirely in accordance with law; nor that the confession of the accused always bears the stamp of probability. \\[Page 96\\]\n\nThe following, however, cannot, without prejudice to the truth, be denied. After the interrogation had, at least for the sake of precaution, been begun again from the beginning --- and that without the torture having even once been threatened either at M\u00fclldorf or at Salzburg --- this crafty, and not, as some falsely spread, simple woman, after many evasions at last made the following confession: She said she had been seduced by a seamstress from Neumarkt (a little town between \u00d6ttingen and Landshut), and had devoted herself exclusively to the Devil by the words written in blood: \"I am yours and you are mine!\"\n\nShe further confessed that she had committed a sacrilegious abuse with the Holy Host, which she had often received and immediately taken from her mouth; that she had several times been carried off, by the Devil's help, to nocturnal dances together with her teacher, the aforementioned seamstress, and others; and that she there had received a lump of sugar, which she afterwards threw into a peasant woman's vat. Thereby it came to pass that the cream of the milk --- however much trouble one took in churning --- nevertheless did not make butter for over half a year; until the peasant woman --- who swore to all this on oath --- sold her cow and bought another; whereupon she made butter without difficulty from the milk of the newly purchased animal, while the purchaser of the old cow likewise made butter from that cow's milk. Finally, she declared that, with the Devil's help, she alone was the cause of the disturbances in the smithy.\n\nI am not one of those who take delight only in the new, often to the detriment of the truth; nor have I sworn by the ancients, who are often credulous to the point of superstition. I know that the judges of past centuries, of whom it is told that they frequently condemned the accused to the stake on mere confession, are charged with a hasty and credulous procedure in matters of magic. Nor is it unknown to me that sugar is ascribed the natural power to dissolve cream so that no butter can be made from it. Nor do I mean to deny that the nocturnal dances and journeys from place to place are not always founded in truth; rather, especially among women, they are represented to them in dreams by the help of the imagination, so that when they awake they cannot be dissuaded from them.\n\nHowever, just as I cannot, without exposing myself to presumption for want of reliable information, either approve or still less condemn everything that our predecessors have done; so it is nevertheless known even to those who otherwise know nothing that the public laws, and among them the penal procedure of Charles V, condemn magicians to the fire; and that only a hardened and unwise person could call their existence into question after a many-hundred-year calm observance. That the use of sugar, without the Devil's assistance, may, now and then, hinder the making of butter from milk is comprehensible; but that a small piece should possess such power that it could spoil a vessel for more than half a year --- a vessel which in the meantime had been cleaned several times --- and exercise these powers so long that the cow which had been in possession during the application of the sugar could not be sold, no reasonable person will concede. Whoever believes that those nocturnal dances and flights through the air really took place as often as simple women tell, and that they themselves were present at them, may be considered even more simple than the women themselves. \\[Page 97\\]\n\nOnly when reasonable witnesses, elevated above all doubt --- several of whom were present, awake and by day --- testify from what they saw with their own eyes that they were led away in their presence, and that they with their own hands drove them out of the house; if now against this authority of ocular testimony one man asserts: this never happened; I know that such a one, as one who shamelessly and without reason denies everything according to his own liking, as they say, deserves the philosopher's rod of correction.\n\nAmong the others those also seemed to me foolish, and asleep with open eyes, who, wishing to gain renown from the novelty of an empty shadow and to embrace a vain appearance instead of the truth, assert that the said seven witnesses might have been deceived in the repeated interrogations, by believing that the hammers and tongs moved without human hand, that they struck them and yet did not wound them; although they testified separately that they had seen these movements in no way caused by the above-mentioned maid, nor in any other way than a supernatural one. For with the same presumption I might then assert: a man who has been robbed only, carried away by his fancy, imagined this, but never possessed the stolen things; the thief dreamed the crime, and the witnesses were falsely persuaded that they had seen the theft.\n\nIt should be noted that the Bavarian seamstress, the teacher of the woman from M\u00fclldorf, taken in at Neumarkt, confessed under the same circumstances that she had seduced ours and that she had gone with her to nocturnal dances; although neither could have had knowledge of the other's confession; whereupon she was also beheaded, and the body burned on the pyre. Nevertheless one might well have hesitated at Salzburg to condemn the other merely on account of the agreement of the confession, if the credibility of the witnesses had not testified to the materiality of the crime and removed all reasonable doubt; so that the truth was as clear as humanly possible. Yet no one should consider the maid simple; for by way of deceit she tore out a leaf from her prayer-book, which she had with her in prison, scratched her skin with a piece of wood instead of a pen, and wrote with her blood: I am yours and you are mine! --- with the intention of making it believed that the devil had restored to her what she had previously given him. She carried this off so slyly that it almost succeeded and one would have believed her. Nor should it be overlooked that both, the woman from Salzburg and the one from Neumarkt, at least to all appearance, received the announcement of the death sentence cheerfully; and both humbly requested the assistance of clergymen for their impending end and strengthening with the holy sacraments.\n\nBut even in this, as P. Laymann wrote a hundred and some years ago as something common to gentlemen, they were alike: that each of them, on the day before the punishment was carried out, complained to one of the assistants that she was being condemned unjustly, and sought counsel whether, under such circumstances, she should suffer the death-penalty or should proclaim her innocence to the judge, even though without hope of pardon.\n\nThe report here given appe"}, "The Prophets' School in Dauphin\u00e9": {"start_char": 334403, "end_char": 343130, "pages": "99-100", "keywords": ["prophets' school in c\u00e9vennes"], "verbatim": "\nAs we have already seen, the practice of magic has kept its higher schools and its initiations under the rein of a certain discipline. An analogous example of what there had taken place there is afforded by the prophets' school which prepared the uprising in the C\u00e9vennes, and which, having arisen from more than ambiguous motives, permitted a conclusion as to the manner in which the affair there unfolded, where the leaders frankly and freely surrendered themselves to evil. The peace of 1682 had been very injurious to the cause of the Calvinists in France; by the thousands the people in the south had returned to the Church. The most resolute among its leaders had, in the following year, raised an insurrection in the Dauphin\u00e9 and in the Vivarais; this, however, proved very unfortunate, and the chiefs had taken refuge in Geneva, in Holland and in Germany to seek help for their cause. Jurieu, one of them, had in 1685 written an exposition of the Apocalypse to prepare the minds; therein he announced the overthrow of the Church within five years and the return of the Reformation in France. This produced the greatest excitement among those peoples in whom the new principle is rooted; and the signs of ecstatic states which appeared here and there in consequence of it probably suggested to the mass of the exiled heads of the Confession in Geneva the thought of ordering and disciplining these states and of making them an ally in the renewed war.\n\nThe scene chosen for this prophets' school was a glassworks called Peyra, in the mountains of the Dauphin\u00e9, amid woods and rocks. At its head they selected Du Serre, one of the most determined Protestants in that district; he, a native of the country, being often engaged in the affairs of the works, frequently came across to Geneva; there meanwhile a committee had been formed which promoted the insurrection; and two preachers, Henry and Perrin, were sent over to stir the people by their sermons. Du Serre now had fifteen boys entrusted to him by his co-religionists in the neighbourhood, while the same number of girls gathered about his wife. First he instilled in these a pronounced hatred of the Church, and then he revealed to them: that God had communicated his spirit to him, that he gives it to every one according to his good pleasure; but that he had chosen them in order to transform them into prophets and prophetesses, if they would prepare themselves to receive so great a gift in the manner prescribed by God. The children, in their innocence, were willing, and had now to submit to a strict discipline, in which especially regularly recurring fasts, continued for three days at a stretch, played a principal role; while lectures on the Apocalypse and on the Antichrist in Rome, and his near downfall, directed their minds that way, and familiarized them with the language of the prophets.\n\nUnder this training there gradually appeared in most of the pupils the phenomena of somnambulism; they threw themselves backwards upon the ground, their eyes closed; the region of the pit of the stomach and of the throat swelled, and they remained for a time in this rapt state. When it had come to this point, then the master --- his apprenticeship being, as he said, at an end --- assembled the whole fellowship, placed the person to be proclaimed in the midst of the company, and told him: the time of his inspiration was now come; then he kissed him with a grave and mysterious mien, breathed his breath into his mouth, and announced to him that he was now receiving the spirit of prophecy. The others had witnessed, full of astonishment, the birth of the new prophet, and were moved by the longing soon likewise to attain, in like manner, to the same consecration. After he had thus absolved them all, he sent them out, each to his own place, admonishing them to bestow again upon others the gift of prophecy whom they found fit for it, and who had gone through the same training as themselves. Among the young pupils of the prophetic school two were especially remarkable: a young man of twenty-five years, Gabriel Astier, from the place Clien; and a young shepherdess from the village of Cr\u00eat, called the beautiful Isabelle. While the others remained in concealment, both of them, toward the end of the year 1688, chose respectively a larger scene of action; the one went over into Vivar\u00e8s, the other to Grenoble, at the very time when the Prince of Orange crossed over to England. The Calvinist people were ready to believe the prophets who proclaimed to them the victory of their creed, and thus a great excitement arose in those regions. The vigilance of the authorities, however, prevented an uprising in the Dauphin\u00e9; the prophetess was arrested in Grenoble, and, afterwards being brought to a recognition of her errors, returned to the Church. Astier, in Vivar\u00e8s, having grown more cautious, retired into secrecy, and first consecrated his whole family to the prophetic office, and then others; and when the matter nevertheless became notorious he fled to Bouti\u00e8res, into the wild, inaccessible mountains, and thence began to hold nightly meetings with the inhabitants.\n\nOn the mountain-tops the people gathered, in numbers ranging from a few hundred up to three or four thousand, sometimes at different places simultaneously; on the day appointed by the prophet men, women, and children assembled. The prophet stood among them in a raised place and opened the meeting with the loud cry: Mercy! Mercy! The people answered with the same cry, prostrate on their knees, and the mountains echoed it back. Then a prayer was said, and a psalm sung by all present. Now the presiding officer rose, the assembly did likewise, and after he had cried out, holding his hands over his head, \"Throw yourselves backwards, without danger!\" everyone threw themselves backward; while the prophet, as the number of those falling increased, let his arms sink lower and lower accordingly. The circumstance that sometimes three to four thousand persons thus hurled themselves on their backs without being hurt was regarded as a gift of the prophets. In the midst of the prostrate the prophet himself then fell into the ecstatic state; he was brought back to himself from this state by the candidates for the prophetic office who lay first around him; he then began to prophesy, and went up to the best-prepared among the neophytes, breathed into his mouth, and said: \"Receive the Holy Spirit!\" He at once surrendered his place to the newly consecrated man, who likewise began to prophesy and to communicate the received gift further.\n\nThat the matter did not rest on imagination and artifice, but was rooted in physical states, was shown by the shudders that seized those who fell, the contractions and extensions in arms and legs, the convulsions that made them foam, and the swellings they experienced. They also declared that the spirit communicated itself to them when they had previously taken the fallen upon their laps; and that it usually entered through the loins, which to them seemed as if made of iron. The country soon became covered with branches of the original school; a general uprising was to be feared, one which could easily spread over the whole south as far as Gascony. Serious measures were therefore taken; in the first encounter the delusion of the excited men was scattered: they were not invulnerable, nor could they, with the cry \"Tartara,\" put the armies of their opponents to flight. Several other encounters followed, the armed bands were dispersed, Astier was taken and tried, and the province thus pacified. \\[Page 100\\]\n\nSparks of the conflagration had meanwhile been blown as far as the C\u00e9vennes, and in the year 1688 there was a first outbreak, which however was soon suppressed. But in the year 1702, with the outbreak of the War of Succession, the smothered flame broke out anew and raised the C\u00e9vennes War, which was led by the Prophets. They were here arranged one above another in four ranks. The lowest comprised the awakened; the second those who obtained the Spirit by the breath; the third those who obtained prophecy; the fourth those who simply possessed the gift, and were no longer occupied with worldly things, neither prophesying nor sitting on the council. All that had been seen in the time of the Manichaeans and the Anabaptists repeated itself anew in this memorable war, which the mountain people waged with great courage and resolution; wherein, however, they also all too often stained themselves with coldly calculated murder and cruelties, and fell prey to manifold deceptions; from which, as from the outcome of the whole enterprise, it equally proved that the spirit in which they trusted had not been a"}, "The Demonic Seduction of Magdalena Bavent": {"start_char": 343155, "end_char": 364825, "pages": "100-107", "keywords": ["- confessions of magdalena bavent"], "verbatim": "Life of Magdalena Bavent\n\nOne may say here: the people fought for their conviction, even if erroneous, against a faith that had been forced upon them; and their leaders, though they made a grievous abuse of their power of enthusiasm, had at least for the most part passed through the same school, and had themselves been enthusiastic before they roused enthusiasm in others. But where from the outset pure depravity, recognized as such, lies at the root; where the leaders have given themselves over beforehand to the absolutely evil for its own sake, and now from it become seducers of others whom they wish to win for its realm: there the demon himself is present, and the whole act becomes demonic, and shows itself as such in its consequences. So it went in the tale of the seduction of Magdalena Bavent, which she set down in her memoirs, and which we will relate in her own words.\n\n\"Born in the year 1607 in Rouen, I lost my parents at about nine years of age; I was brought up by an uncle until my twelfth year, and then remained until my sixteenth in the house of a woman in order to learn to sew. At that time a convent according to the rule of St.\u00a0Francis was established in Louviers, to which saint I had always had a special devotion. I therefore wished to be received there; my relatives interceded for me, and I obtained admission. I entered the convent with the intention, as I can swear on my soul, of serving the Lord there with all sincerity, and began my novitiate in that intention. But we had a terrible man who guided us, the priest David. He read with us the book of a Capuchin about the will of God; but he interpreted this in a most peculiar manner, in which our mistress-novices entirely agreed with him. Under the pretext of obtaining perfect obedience, which must also overcome the most severe and nature-contrary things, he introduced atrocious practices. He said: one must kill sin by sin, in order thereby to return to the innocence of our first parents, who before their fall did not know shame. Those among us were then regarded as the holiest and most virtuous who appeared quite naked in the choir and in the garden, and in that state performed dances. We were accustomed to touch one another; to practice every kind of unnatural sins as paganism had known; to abuse the image of the Crucified and the sacrament of the altar in every possible way.\" \\[Page 101\\]\n\nThe author took what he reports in this book partly from his own observation, partly from the records of the Parliament of Grenoble and from the testimonies of the arrested prophets, especially of the beautiful Isabelle.\n\nAt first I resisted these abominations, and was therefore regarded as a disobedient, headstrong, malicious, and refractory person, who was possessed of her own will. When once I was to go to Communion naked down to the belt, I had refused to do so, but I had to yield; when I wished to cover myself at the small grille with the altar-cloth, this was snatched away from me, and when I then used my hands to cover myself, David ordered me to fold them. My conscience kept making constant reproaches to me about all these things; David said these were not sins, and another confessor whom I asked for was not allowed me. I therefore left the convent; but inexperienced as I was, I took the position of a gatekeeper (pf\u00f6rtnerin) of the convent that was offered me; and so I remained, entirely given over to my indiscretion, in that office, albeit outside the convent, yet continuously connected with it.1) I had left at the end of January; at Candlemas David travelled to Paris, then returned at the end of Lent, and died on the Monday of Holy Week. Nothing had occurred between us, except for some licentiousness; but before his journey he had entrusted to me a little casket with the prohibition not to open it. Curiosity, however, drove me to disobey his command; and I found a paper in it, written by him in an unknown hand, but I returned everything to him on his return. I then tended him for a short time during his illness, which appears to have been a syphilitic sore; and on the day of his death he gave this paper to Mathurin Picard, and appointed him his successor in the convent, in his sense and spirit, and in a private interview recommended me to his care. This paper was the paper of blasphemies that was always used on the Sabbath. \\[Page 102\\]\n\n\\\"So I was in the office of porter, but Picard was confessor and director of the convent. I had now fallen into worse hands than before; his insolence toward me grew quickly, and though I tried to defend myself against him, I could not; for he held me fast in the chains of hell. At Easter I was to make my confession to him; but scarcely had I begun when he would not hear me further; everything I brought forward he said were not sins. He feigned a passionate love that he harbored for me; he begged for reciprocal affection, and began to caress me. Since that confession I had no other kind with him; all were like that sacrilegious and damnable one. Yet I never loved that unhappy priest from the heart, and I do not know by what power he bound me to him and thus kept me bound. It is a misery when one does not leave to souls the choice of their confessor, and binds them to one who can ruin them.\n\nOur relationship was known in the convent; even outside, many pressed to pull me out of the danger; but in the convent they would not allow me another confessor. It is true that I myself did nothing about it --- whether from timidity or a tendency to an unbound life --- which I ought to have done. He pursued me continually, and did not cease from me even in a violent illness, when I was senseless and more dead than alive. Yet because of my resistance he did not succeed in gaining his whole will with me all that time; except once, when he was ill, or only pretended to be ill, and then using force rather than persuasion he wrested my consent from me. What has been said about a similar occurrence in the church is, thank God, unfounded except for one attempt on his part.\n\nThat, however, was not the only thing he intended against me to rob me of my honor; there was another thing I did not suspect because I did not know his devilish arts. While I was ill he had me sign a paper whose contents I did not know. Once at the altar he put a host into my hand, and then, pressing my hand, he broke it so that the pieces fell to the ground. Likewise he wanted me to drink of the wine which he had left in the chalice after the completion of the Mass --- which I, however, never did. Once he said to me: 'My dear, I am building this church; after my death you will see miracles; will you not agree?' I said yes, without understanding the meaning of his words. \\[Page 103\\]\n\nI was concerned only for my honor; he feared on his side that I might be pregnant: therefore he consented that I should go back into the convent, which was no difficulty, since he furnished a sum of money for it. I found there still the same filth in the novitiate as before, although Picard did not come and go among the nuns as freely as David had done earlier. Hardly fifteen days had I been there when he sought a pretext to come into the garden where I was with some nuns. He followed us, and after he had come to a certain spot he produced a host from a book he had with him; with it he picked up some drops of blood that had fallen to the ground, for I was then menstruating. He wrapped them up, called me out into the churchyard, and used my finger to push them into an opening near a shrub. He never spoke to me further about the matter; but I acquired a strong inclination to go repeatedly to that spot, and there I had many filthy temptations and practiced much impurity. Later --- I believe soon after I had taken my vows --- he demanded a copy of my profession; I wrote it while he dictated.\\\" \\[Page 104\\]\n\nThen he said, when I was about to sign them, that I must now bind my purpose to his; if he should die before me, I must be willing to die likewise; if he were damned or saved, I must choose the same fate for myself. I was terribly frightened by this, and after much resistance I gave only an outward assent, up to, as I believe, the point of damnation. Meanwhile I continued to suffer many pangs of conscience, and I wished to make my confession to the confessor of the sick in the hospital we visited. Picard, who perceived this, hastened to put his design into effect. One day, when he handed me Communion at the grille, he touched my breast through the veil with his finger, and instead of the usual words said: \"You will see what will happen to you because of this.\" I went to my place in the choir, but restlessness drove me into the garden, where I sat down beneath a mulberry tree. There appeared to me a cat which set its hind feet on my knees and its forepaws on my shoulders, and then barred its dreadful jaws over my mouth, as if it would take the Communion from me. Whether that actually happened I do not know; for I sat there for perhaps an hour, unable to make the sign of the cross or to drive the creature away. Picard saw me that same day, and when I asked: was that all the glory I was to receive that day? he answered: \"You will see quite other things yet!\" Two or three days later he said: \"My dear! we have now seen one another; do you not wish that we should see one another again?\" I said yes, to the ruin of my soul. In the night, about eleven, after I had already slept, I heard what sounded like a nun calling me. I rose, and when I reached the door I lost consciousness and felt myself carried to a place where, besides Picard, several clerics and nuns were present. He at once said: \"Beloved, did I not tell you we would see one another again today?\" I answered: \"Yes; but I did not think it would be outside the convent; this assembly is also unknown to me.\" He said: \"You must not trouble yourself about that,\" and so he drew from me a formal assent to everything that was there to happen and that he in particular would do --- the one and only formal assent he extracted from me. Yet my conscience would never be entirely pacified; Picard knew this well, and therefore never quite trusted me, nor did he ever initiate me into his secrets. The day after that event I disclosed everything to the confessor Langlois; whether he was aware of the matter or not, he did not tell me that I had been led to the Sabbath, and left me without counsel. Six months later I told him of my more frequent abductions; which was the easier to do because he had been given the monastery confessional, and Picard, on suspicion, had been removed from it. I had resolved to make a general confession, and had already made three quarters of it, when Picard learned of it and had me called to the confessional grille. He asked why I had stayed so long with the new confessor. I answered: to make a general confession. \"Well,\" he said, touching my hand, \"you have begun, but you will not finish!\" He had spoken truly, for, as he afterwards confessed to me, he had cast a spell between me and the confessor; when I began, it was as if the confessor closed my mouth and drove the sins back. He seemed to be bound in my presence; I, however, as soon as I entered the confessional, was terribly tormented. It pressed down upon me with great force when I tried to begin; it struck my head against the walls and threw me to the ground. One could hear the blows I received; people saw me swollen and black and blue from them, without knowing whence they came. \\[Page 105\\]\n\nAfter the Communions I was turned over, my feet pointing upward, and I was compelled to vomit up what I had taken. I wrote to Father Benedict, but the letter was taken from me. I wrote to the Bishop of Evreux; my letters, some of which still remain, did not make an impression until the fifth year of my torments.\n\nIf one considers this hair\u2011raising story of seduction, which embraces the events of many years, and in which many transitions may have dropped out owing to the unfaithfulness of memory, the horror that besets these depths of human nature will whirl and confound the spirit that looks down into them, unless it rests on the most secure foundation. If among the sacraments the Eucharist must be regarded as first, because it subordinates itself as the essence and core of the whole house of healing to its centre, then after it priestly ordination will follow first in order; for it must prepare the ways and the little rill in which the streams of this and all sacraments flow. Just as things stand concerning the sacraments in the Church of Light, so do they stand concerning the execraments in the demon's midnight church, in which the real substance of the sacramental is transformed into an ape\u2011like, lying mockery. Thus the deepest negation is implanted in the Sabbath's Eucharist, which therefore also holds the apex of these execraments; while the next place in the sevenfold order is occupied by the witchly ordination, which opens the ways through which the curse of hell comes upon the world. If now the consecrated of the Lord, priests and his brides, are to be transformed into the consecrated of the demon, his sorcerer\u2011priests and his paramours, then, before their luciferization takes place---to use the phrase of one from their midst---first their debasement must precede; only immediately, and indeed only after the full and unambiguous assent, the uncoerced joining of their will has taken place, will the reception and immediately the promotion to the priesthood occur.\n\nTo this end the asceticism that those priests of the abyss introduced into the novitiate was calculated: the novices were to pass, by an indifferent state of nature, into the contrary state, and sin was not to be combatted by good but to be killed by suicide through itself; so that, after shame, set as guardian, had been extinguished, the access of nature on that side would stand open. David had gone so far when Picard took his place. He had been pastor at Mesnil\u2011Fourdain near Louviers, and was regarded as a man highly experienced in the spiritual life. But, as Father Esprit du Bosroger, who knew him, related, he had been in league with a sect of false Illuminati; and he knew how to control his mien, gait, speech and all his actions so well that one might have taken him for an angel of heaven. His serious bearing, his downcast eyes, the long beard, the pallor of his face; the mildness of his words, to which those who spoke with him accommodated themselves; the warmth of his zeal, the measuredness of his actions, the restraint of his ideas despite all reserve, sometimes exalted by flaming words about God or Paradise; his sighs and his contemplative expression, the long duration of his Masses, during which he appeared beside himself; his prayers of thanksgiving interrupted by sobs and deep silence---all gave him the appearance of a great friend of God and a consummate spiritual man; and yet he was nothing but a great Pharisee and hypocrite, a wolf among the sisters of that convent.\n\nHe continued where his predecessor had left off. Nakedness, he said, was originally the sign of true innocence; for all sin is not in the body and in bodily actions, but in the discrimination of human craftiness. \\[Page 106\\]\n\n\"He who distinguishes is accursed and damned,\" says the Apostle; he who does not see sin has not committed any, for the spirit, closely united with God, has committed none. All human cleverness and earthly understanding, even shame, must therefore be mortified; the spirit must not crawl into reflections, meditations and distinctions about its actions; but, abandoning itself to passions and earthly faults, give them over to tear themselves to pieces in confusion, and then fly with the eagle to the sun.\n\nNo wonder that the woman Bavent, a spiritually limited but passionately bold girl, fell into the pitfalls of this gnostic; three or four others who had listened to him had, as P. Esprit relates --- who later for a long time was confessor in the convent --- the same fate; the others would hardly all have escaped him, had he not been led away by trials to Rome and Paris, and, after he returned, had not illnesses removed him from their path.\n\nIt is a general law of nature that opposites, so long as they are not abolished, only tighten themselves the more. Thus cold cuts most sharply when it meets increased heat in the organ, just as positive stimulants act most strongly on negative dispositions. The seducer proceeded by this law in his work. As the sacraments possess a sanctifying power, so there lies in the counter\u2011sacraments a desecrating one; the latter in an eminent degree where its effect is combined with the profanation of the former.\n\nHe therefore first abused the sacrament of confession, in order by it to tie on those physical bonds through which such things always begin; bonds which finally led to the satisfaction of his lusts, and, given the nervous state of Bavent, for example, as one cannot mistake, brought her organic life into magnetic rapport with him. Now further steps were taken to obtain the attunement of her will to the other covenant. At first he was content with forged signatures and ambiguous consents to participate in the new Church. Later he comes nearer to his goal by forming, with her blood contained in a host, a new vinculum that ritually binds her to him. Thereupon the taking of her vows, the analogue of priestly ordination, is used to allot the same to her in the church of the abyss, and to win from her a formal consent to a bond of life and death; only when the extension of that bond beyond death is to be made does nature recoil in terror. Therefore one now proceeds to initiation into the deepest mysteries of the night, and the Eucharist, the holiest thing, must be helpful to the unholiest. He offers it to her, and as she swallows the morsel, the evil enemy has also entered into her. She now becomes clairvoyant, and the cat that she sees, and afterwards the incubus that pursues her, is the first available expression of the new relation she has entered. The initiate is then --- but only after she has once more explicitly given her consent --- introduced on the Sabbath; where she must once again, in the circle of the inner life, give her formally and afterwards also in writing confirmed assurance of full attunement. She has made her covenant with the seed of the dragon; now only enmity must be set between her and the seed of the woman. \\[Page 107\\]\n\nTherefore, when she looks back toward the church she had left, because the impulse to make her confession of sins in the confessional has risen in her, the evil spirit who has seduced her sets himself, in all his acquired power, between her and the priest. The ecclesiastical element awakens cramps and convulsions in the inward-turned nature, and she is forcibly prevented from the confession of sins and flung back into the mire. Thus an iron band has been forged about the unhappy woman, and a demonic-magnetic pull chains her to him who, as the representative of the evil enemy, stands opposite her.\n\nNow if the simple force of nature --- that organic gravity and mutual attraction which runs through all life --- in vital magnetism binds the magnetized to the magnetizer, so that the latter lives only in the former, thinks his thoughts, and, from a distance and to a certain degree, moves and makes him act according to his will, then incomparably more must a magnetic natural force thus directed and rooted in her, and strengthened by the power of the demonic, take effect. One cannot say that the acceptance of such an irresistible force is incompatible with human freedom and moral accountability. For the prior surrender of that freedom is the absolutely necessary precondition before the efficacy of this power can enter; and even then, with the withdrawal of that consent, return and liberation are possible, though exceedingly difficult.\n\nWith the surrender of the will, therefore, this rapport immediately manifests itself in all its power; the one who renounces is entrusted with it to the foreign spirit, and at once a spiritual community of goods arises between them --- a common production of thoughts, in which he, in a state of demonic ecstasy, stands as father, and she confronts him as mother. That will be especially the case in the vision of the Sabbath, which takes its first origin from him; from him it is then received, and in her carried and brought forth into the night. It is therefore he who first called her to the Sabbath, and continually gives the initial impulse to the work. Invariably she thus appears to be bound to his person; she always finds herself near him, speaks with him, learns what is going on there, as it were through his mediation; the whole act appears bound to him, and has no existence without him. Thus, when he died, she was no longer led to him; she is a widow who has been made wingless, who can no longer get there by her own power.\n\nVery remarkable, therefore, is also what occurred at his death. She relates concerning it: \"When he lay in agony and I went up the stairs to the gallery of the sleeping-chamber, I saw Boull\u00e9 (whom he had appointed his successor in office) enter the court as if he were going to the chapel, with a dreadful countenance. At the same time the window through which I had looked down to him was broken before me; and I had a demonic seizure, being dragged through the dormitory and very badly treated. When that same evening I sat in my cell, there was a violent knocking on the beams, and I heard in a hoarser voice: 'We have our booty!'

For the natural way divides itself at this point of departure, in that what in it had been intertwined with one another there separates; and from thence two distinct ways proceed, each in a different direction: one of which rises upward to the light, the other leads down into the night.\n\nJust as at the divisions of lands and waters, it depends on a small elevation or depression of the ground whether the waters flow to the north or to the south, to this or that sea; so at these great forks of life there works a thrust of the deeper nature which takes refuge behind pride, and the titillation at the call of holiness, so that the downward way is chosen; at first under the delusion that it is the one which leads upward. In place of the serpent of salvation and light there is then the dragon of the abyss, which, having seized its tail with its mouth and appropriated self-consciousness to itself; and as it illuminates with its false, glittering light the inner being that it entangles, the deluded one imagines himself to walk in the light of Godhead itself. Examples will here most clearly set forth this unhappy relation, and we cannot choose a more striking one than that which occurred in the first half of the sixteenth century in Spain. There lived at that time Magdalena del Cruz, a Franciscan nun in the convent of St.\u00a0Elizabeth at C\u00f3rdoba; born in 1487 at Aguilar, entering that convent in 1504, and, having rapidly attained to great reputation for holiness, chosen abbess in 1532 and again in 1536 and 1540; but in 1541 brought before the Inquisition, which then instituted proceedings against her. \\[Page 109\\]\n\nA witness in that same process may be heard concerning the reputation in which she stood, as follows. \"The good repute which she enjoyed made acquaintance with her desirable to me; for everything I was told of her excited my admiration, and I heard all the world speak of her holiness. Not only the people held this opinion, but eminent persons: cardinals, archbishops, bishops, dukes, scholars, men of the orders of every kind esteemed her highly. I learned in particular how Cardinal Alphons Maurique came over expressly from Seville to see her, and in his letters called her his very dear daughter; how the Inquisitors of C\u00f3rdoba showed her the greatest respect, and how Cardinal Quignones, General of the Franciscans, made the journey from Rome to visit and speak with her. Also I myself had seen how Jean Reggio, the nuncio of the Roman court, had arrived in C\u00f3rdoba to satisfy his curiosity; and our Empress, the consort of Charles V, had called her in a letter her very dear mother, and the happiest being on earth. That letter, in addition to her portrait as a memento that she should remember her in prayer, was accompanied by the veil and the baptismal shirt of her newly born prince, Philip II; for the purpose that she should pronounce a blessing over both. People spoke of her throughout Christendom; the preachers praised her from the pulpits, and all others paid her homage in the same way, without giving room to any doubt about her merit and her holiness.\"\n\nShe was the object of the most tender affection of all the confessors of the convent, and of the provincial of the order; and those who were furthest advanced in piety believed they saw in her way of life a new path to attain sanctity. In truth she was amiable toward everyone, loving with modesty, compassionate and so good an example that she urged everyone to serve God; and indeed her company led many persons to enter a religious life. Her skill in conducting affairs was so great that people pressed from all sides to hear her counsel, and her convent was comparable to an office.\n\nOther witnesses who testified to the same matters also spoke of her ecstasies and her raptures; they brought up her prophecies and the prognostications she had made: among other things, how she foretold the death of the Marquis of Billen, the cardinal's hat for her order's general Quignones, the captivity of King Francis I, and his marriage to the widowed Queen of Portugal, the sister of Charles V. All this had led to a biography of her being printed even during her lifetime. So it stood with her outwardly, and now one may marvel at the labyrinths of the human heart: she herself appeared on the 7th of May 1546 at her Auto da F\u00e9 to hear her final sentence, after the secretary of the court had read the extract of her trial, from which the following results concerning her inner life emerged. \\[Page 110\\]\n\nMagdalena had testified that when she was in her fifth year the demon had appeared to her in the shape of an angel of light, and had proclaimed to her that she was called to become a great saint; at the same time urging her to lead a devout life immediately. The apparitions had thereafter recurred often. Once the spirit had assumed the form of the Crucified and had urged her to crucify herself with him; which she performed with the help of nails that she drove into the walls. But when he then invited her to follow him, she fell to the ground and had two ribs broken, which the spirit, always in the guise of the Lord, afterward healed. When she had been seven years old, the demon, continuing the deception further, encouraged her to begin an even stricter life. Burning with great zeal, she therefore one night left her paternal house at Aguilar and went to a nearby cave with the intention of living there as a hermit.\n\nThe next morning, however, she had found herself again in her father's house without knowing how it had happened to her. One day the spirit, constantly pretending to be the Lord, married her, and as a sign of the union touched two of her fingers; announcing to her at the same time that the growth of the touched fingers would henceforth be arrested; which accordingly occurred, and she resolved to relate the incident to many people as a miracle. At twelve years old she was already regarded as a saint, and to secure herself in this reputation she performed many good works and false miracles. She had visions of spirits who took on the form of those saints she especially venerated; such as St.\u00a0Jerome, Dominic, Francis and Anthony. In their presence she fell to her knees, thinking them to be saints; at times she even believed she saw the Holy Trinity and other extraordinary things; and all this only increased her desire to be esteemed a saint. When this vanity had at last become predominant in her soul, the demon showed himself to her in the guise of a very handsome young man, confiding to her that he was one of the fallen seraphim, and that he had accompanied her since her fifth year. His name was Balban, and that of a companion he had was Pithon.\n\nHe made her understand that if she continued to stand to him in the same relation as before, she could enjoy every pleasure whose notion her spirit could conceive; and that it would then be his business to spread still further the reputation for holiness which she had already attained. Magdalena accepted the proposal on the condition that she should not be bound forever, which Balban granted without scruple. There followed a formal pact with the demon, in which she promised to give herself up to his counsel. From that moment the spirit, as an incubus, clung to her, until the extrajudicial confession which she made in her convent in 1543. Once he appeared to her in a black, hideous form; and when she, terrified by it, cried \"Jesus!\" that drove him off. He, however, soon returned, vehemently reproached her for her mistrust, but then reconciled himself with her again when she promised not to be frightened again should he appear to her in the same guise; which thereafter happened several times. \\[Page 111\\]\n\nAfter she had taken the habit, whenever she went to Communion she gave a cry and feigned ecstasies which her fellow-sisters took for real. On one such occasion her feet were pierced with pins; she did indeed feel the pain, but restrained herself so as not to lose her reputation. For the same reason she several times had herself crucified in her cell, and inflicted wounds on her hands, feet and side. With the help of her spirit she sometimes left the convent and visited some other place; there she saw everything that had taken place and then told it to others to display her secret knowledge. Once she was said to have been in Rome, and to have received Communion from the hands of a priest who was burdened with a mortal sin. Meanwhile no one in the convent noticed her absence; for Pithon had entered there in her form in her stead. Her spirit foretold to her many future events: for example the captivity and marriage of the King of France, the wars of the Communeros and other things; yet not all that he thus proclaimed came to pass. She fell out with him from time to time: once, when he had made to her a shameful demand and she had rejected him, he in his anger tore her up very high and then let her fall back to the ground; so that she was carried back to her cell in a very bad state.\n\nWith regard to the deceptions by which she contrived to set herself in the reputation for holiness, Majolus's account points more to supernatural states, only intensified on the wrong side; whereas the extracts that Florente made in his Wunderscheu rather seem to betray a crafty trickster who was at first deceived and then deceived others and herself. The former assures us: on feast days she was often seen hovering three or more ells above the ground. Whenever, on the appointed days, she went with the other nuns to Communion, one of the hosts --- previously and carefully counted --- was always found missing from the priest who distributed them; it was then ultimately found, visibly to all, in her mouth. Often she carried the image of the newborn Redeemer in her arms, showering it with her tears; and in doing so her hair had grown down to her feet, and in like manner gradually receded again. Florente tells either a different incident, or the same in another way, when he reports that she, in an abusive apprehension of a mystical idea, made the nuns and others believe that she had conceived the child by the Holy Spirit on the day of the Annunciation and had given birth to it at Christmas from light. She then wrapped the newborn in her hair, which then, black as it had previously been, became red; but the child left her some time afterwards. \\[Page 112\\]\n\nPeople now wanted the hair as relics in many places, and she gave some of it to several people. One day, when she was in the choir with the nuns, her demon, it was said, came in the shape of a dove and sat close to her ear. She then told the sisters that it was the Holy Spirit, and they thereupon threw themselves down to worship it. She confessed that for eleven years she had tried to make people believe that she took no food and contented herself only with the Eucharist. But this had been false; for during the first seven years she had secretly eaten bread and drunk water, assisted in this by some nuns trusted by her. During the last four years she had eaten various things that others knew how to procure for her. In addition she had persuaded others to eat meat on fast days, or even to work on feast days, because it was not forbidden; she had also made those with whom she associated closely believe that many priests and monks kept concubines without offending God, because it was not a sin to have such companions. She confessed many other false revelations, apparitions of souls, angels, and demons; many false prophecies, healings, and in general manifold abuses which she had made of her reputation for holiness.\n\nShe had carried on her charade for thirty\u2011eight years with success; at last her pretence that she did not eat became the rock upon which she foundered. Some convent sisters had grown suspicious, looked more closely, and in the last year of her office as superior discovered the fraud. They revealed what they had discovered to the provincial, the guardian, and the confessors; no one would give credence to their statements, and all declared the accusation to be slander. On the day, however, when a new election in the convent took place, the party of her opponents gained the upper hand, and one of them was elected abbess. This happened in 1542. Until then the alms that had been brought to her had been immeasurable; and she had applied them to the advantage of the convent, which she had almost rebuilt from the ground up. Now, since she no longer stood at its head, she used what she received as she pleased, because the donors had left everything to her discretion.\n\nIn the following year she became seriously ill; her conscience awoke, and after hard struggles she now made a confession, by word and in writing, of all the deceptions she had practised. The letter of a nun dated 30 January 1544, in the records, gives an account of what took place on that occasion. The physicians had declared that her condition left no room for hope and that she must prepare herself for death. When her confessor appeared to prepare her to receive the last sacraments, she was seized by a convulsive trembling whose violence put everyone in alarm. She begged him to return the next day; but when the convulsions recurred that day and the next, the confessor concluded that a supernatural cause lay at the root of it, and he exorcised her. The power of the exorcism forced the demon to speak through her mouth. He said he was one of the seraphim, that at his side stood a companion, and that several legions obeyed him. He had possessed Magdalena almost from her birth, and was of the firm resolve not to leave her; because she belonged to him, and he lived in the hope of dragging her down with him into Hell. The confessor then gathered all the convent sisters and asked them, in their presence, to confirm what they had heard. She then declared that she had had several demons since her childhood, and that she had kept them willingly since her thirteenth year, in accordance with a pact she had concluded with them on the condition of attaining the reputation of sanctity. \\[Page 113\\]\n\nShe added to this confession the account of a host of particular circumstances that aroused astonishment. The confessor reported what had occurred to the provincial of the order, who arrived at the convent before Christmas 1513 with several other members of the order. The inquisitors of C\u00f3rdoba, having been informed of the matter, now intervened in the affair and asserted that the investigation belonged to them exclusively. The provincial had meanwhile put himself in readiness to administer the sacraments to her; and arranged that she should sign in her cell a statement in which she confessed several of her deceptions. Magdalena then received the viaticum and thanked God that she had been able to perform this act without an outward and striking incident; although she nevertheless always doubted that God would show her mercy.\n\nThe convent sisters had withdrawn; Magdalena was alone with the one who had recorded all these circumstances in her letter, and who had stayed behind to make the preparations necessary for the Last Anointing. Suddenly the sick woman told her that she felt much better, expressed an extraordinary desire to take food, and urgently begged her to bring something to satisfy her hunger. When the sister now brought her some nourishment, she seemed to return to life with joy. When the confessor visited her, she wished to continue her confession orally; the confessor prepared to set it down in writing in the presence of Father Peter of Vergara. But Magdalena opened her mouth only to retract everything she had previously declared; whereupon the two priests left her displeased. The nuns then urged her, for the sake of her own peace, to make a sincere confession, and she at last promised them. The confessor then acted as if he were dismissing everyone; but they positioned themselves so that they could hear everything without being seen by the patient. Magdalena then made various declarations, the confessor wrote them down, and obtained from her the promise to sign the written statement in the presence of the convent sisters. They appeared at once; but as they drew near, trembling and convulsions returned to her. The confessor therefore resumed the exorcisms; the evil spirit again began to speak in her and declared that he still possessed her person. Finally, on the 14th of December the patient calmly repeated in the presence of the provincial the confessions she had made and confirmed them; and the agents of the Inquisition immediately arrested her and led her to the prisons of the Office.\n\nTo the circumstances as Florente here relates them from the records --- though of course only in extract, passing over everything that seemed to him incredible --- Majolus adds some others, which likewise have no other attestation than this very testimony. During the investigation the demon, who --- according to another reporter --- usually took the form of a Moor, by no means abandoned his outward performances; he was present at matins, to the astonishment and consternation of the nuns, in her form, and undertook many other ministrations on her behalf. The nuns therefore conceived such an abhorrence of their former abbess that, after an inquiry into her case, they by many entreaties finally brought it about that she be removed from the convent, so that the haunting might at last cease. \\[Page 114\\]\n\nIn order to judge how much cunning fraud, self\u2011deception and indeed demonic besetting on their part have cooperated here; how much the credulity and partiality of their surroundings have contributed, one would at the very least have to have the records themselves before one; and even with their addition it would be difficult to assign to each of these moments --- which probably all acted together --- its definite boundary. She was, moreover, condemned to proceed from her cell in the religious habit, but without veil, with a rope about her neck, a gag in her mouth, and a burning candle in her hand, to the cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba; where a scaffold for her Auto da F\u00e9 had been erected, in order from there to hear the reading of her sentence, as well as the customary sermon that followed. The sentence ran as follows: that she should be enclosed in a convent of Franciscan nuns outside the city, there to pass the remainder of her days. She was to be excluded from the assemblies of the community, and exercise no voice therein; she was not to be permitted to wear a veil, and every Friday was to dine with the penitents in the refectory. Without the permission of the Inquisition she was never to dare to speak with anyone, her fellow\u2011sisters, the confessor, and her superiors excepted; and only after the lapse of three years was she to be admitted again to the Lord's table, unless in the case of serious illness. The sentence concluded that, if she transgressed even one of these prescriptions, she should be regarded as a"}, "The Possession and Exorcism of Johanna Fery": {"start_char": 387317, "end_char": 419559, "pages": "116-126", "keywords": ["two-year exorcism of johanna"], "verbatim": "\nBorn shortly after the middle of the sixteenth century, in Soignies on the Sambre, she then became a nun in the convent of the Black Sisters in the town of Bergen in Hainaut, belonging to the diocese of Cambrai. In the year 1584, when she counted twenty-five years, and Louis of Berlaimont was Archbishop and Duke of Cambrai, it was perceived and noted in her that she was possessed and taken by evil spirits; and the archbishop decreed that the ecclesiastical remedies should be applied to her. The struggle lasted nearly two years; at last she was entirely freed after hard resistance, and shortly before, in obedience to a vision, she wrote her self-confessions, which we here communicate in extract.\n\nI know that by my father's curse I was delivered to the Devil. In my fourth year he appeared to me in the form of a handsome young man, desired to be my father; and because he brought me an apple and white bread, I consented to his request and took him for my real father. As long as I was still a child, I had beside him another who took care that I would not feel the blows when I was punished. That continued until my twelfth year, when, weary of the convent in which they had me educated, I returned to my mother. From there I was soon again bound out to a seamstress in Bergen, so that I should learn to sew there, where I then had almost my free will. Now my alleged father came to me, saying: because I had taken him as father, I must necessarily live by his will. Hitherto I had lived like a child; now, however, it was fitting that I live as he would show me; and like all people lived, even if they did not say so. If I did not do it, he would inflict upon me the pain which he showed me; if I consented to what he required of me, I should have silver and gold whenever I wished, and of food and drink whatever my heart desired.\n\nAt first I refused, then I yielded to him, and granted everything he wanted. Now a great throng of them appeared before me, whereat I was somewhat terrified, because I had never seen more than two or three of them together. They then made me take paper and pen and write down that I renounced baptism, Christianity, and all the ceremonies of the Christian Church. After I signed the document with my blood, they made me swallow it in a bitter orange. It seemed very sweet to me up to the last bite; that last bite, however, was so bitter that I could not endure it. From that time on I have been everywhere hostile to the Church, had a great dread of it, always sought to flee and avoid it, and to hide myself from it; otherwise, however, I have always lived in every wickedness and all sins.\n\nWhen I had grown somewhat older and they began to speak to me of receiving the holy Sacrament, it was most abhorrent to them; and they tormented me almost until I promised them that, if I got hold of that, I would act according to their counsel and will. First I had to give and present my tongue to one of them, so that in confession before the priest I would say nothing more than what they deemed good. When I was to go to the Lord's table, they had made the holy Host altogether loathsome to me, and had made me abhor it; yet I was to comport myself with a false heart and flattery about it, as the others among whom I lived did. \\[Page 117\\]\n\nEven during and throughout Mass I ate much sugar and confectionery, to the shame of the most venerable Sacrament. When I then received the Host at the altar, I immediately stepped to one side; and because, as long as I had it in my mouth, I was sorely tormented in my throat, I took it straight out and wrapped it in my neckerchief. At home I laid it in a little white linen cloth; though they wished that I should cast it into some unclean place. Afterwards, however, it was by a higher power taken away from my person. I could not comprehend why people of such wicked sort showed so much reverence and adored it: and no one could give me any satisfactory account of it. My questioning angered the evil spirits; they blasphemed the holy Host to the utmost, and I had to draw up a document for them in which I renounced that loose, vain Communion, together with the false god on the cross. I also cursed the sacrifice of the Mass, and vowed that whenever I saw the Host lifted up I would, with my eyes fixed upon it, spit in Christ's face, and blaspheme and revile him. In return I bound myself to worship their gods henceforth, and to observe all their ceremonies.\n\nThey put the writing, written with my blood, into my body; a third writing, to abide with them forever, they kept in their custody outside my body. Thus I was wholly and entirely separated from the Catholic Church, as if I had never been in it. Since it did not at all times suit that I should be able to remove the Host from my mouth at Communion, I agreed with them that they should all depart from me on that same day. For they could not endure the burden of the holy Host; it pressed upon them too strongly, and they held me on that very day to be unclean and unfit; but on the following day they tormented me all the harder for it. Whenever I wished to go to church, they made my limbs so heavy, as if I were dragging masses of iron behind me.\n\nWhen I entered the order, I once more set up for them a new writing: in which I granted them full power over body and soul; I bestowed upon them both of my free possessions forever, and entrusted them wholly to their protection and shelter. Thus they had almost swallowed me up, and wholly transformed me into themselves; and I could do no good work any more, lived quite brutishly without any knowledge of God; yet they let me go on carelessly and without seriousness in performing what the order required. On the night before I took the customary monastic vows, they made me write a protestation: that my vow should be only a sham; instead of yielding my obedience to God and to my superiors, I gave it into their hands, to deal with it for their favor. I am, they said, not a nun at all, and would never be one in eternity; as proof of this I delivered to them the profession which I had made. Thus the longer I was with them, the more perverse I became. If sometimes good thoughts came to me, they tormented me with many godless things, and I had now to put my heart in writing to them as well; so that they might lay the writing upon what had been written, and govern it thereby according to their pleasure.\n\nNow a cursed spirit came to me, who at first threatened me most severely, and demanded of me that I should grant him alone as much power over body and soul as all the others together had. He also brought three others with him, whom I was to permit to enter and depart my body at their pleasure; in return he promised to furnish me so richly with art and skill that I might confute everyone who came against me. I was rashly curious, and would gladly have learned the art which he almost loudly extolled to me. \\[Page 118\\]\n\nI was also persuaded, and gave to the first of the three my memory, to the second my understanding, to the third my will; and they each carried them into me and placed them in their particular seat. Thus all my senses were bound, and I was transformed from a person into a devil. The loose knave then brought me another one, who was called the Enchanter; he had the shape of a R\u00fcbezahl, almost fair and pleasant to look upon. When I held this in my hands I saw and knew whatever I could desire. By means of it I also had knowledge of all evil and unjust doctrines and religions in every place and corner; I also saw and knew all their ceremonies and the falsely supposed worship of God that is practiced everywhere; of that one could write an unspeakable amount. To this I was moreover obliged: that, if every earlier obligation should become powerless, the one, strangely written in foreign and unknown characters, and as comprehensive as the others, should remain hidden and valid. After him followed another, called Freilehre; he gathered blasphemers, heathens and Saracens about him. He asked me why I still carried a piece of the Cross on me. I had to tear it from me with terrible railing and cursing; they made me trample it with my feet, and I had to renounce the crucified God who allowed himself to be hanged on it, and his blood, all the articles of the faith and the holy sacraments.\n\nThey set before me now meals of all sorts of foods, and I held myself the happiest person on earth; in this they greatly strengthened me, and I was entirely willing and ready. After some time they accused me that I had never asked any favor of them; I should desire to receive baptism in their fashion and manner, which I then did, so that I would become wholly and entirely their own. They then took off my garment, anointed all my limbs with a precious oil, as it seemed to me, together with other great pomp; then clothed me again in quite different garments, and I chanted with them their loose, doggish Mass and cursed devilish words. Since they also said they had no power to fasten me entirely in their service until I renounced all the graces I had received from the Church, I had to deny the sacrament of Confirmation. I was now also to receive Communion, in their fashion and manner, from their hands every month, and beforehand abstain for three days from every other food, except that which they gave me. They then took a morsel which had a very pleasant and sweet taste; with that they played much mockery and pomp. They did this upon a high elevated place, pronounced a blessing over it according to their opinion; then they gave it into my mouth, and that they called their Communion.\n\nAgainst the Christian Communion they spoke blasphemous, scornful words; I had to throw the holy Host to the ground, and they spat upon it; yet I am quite certain I remember that I could never bring myself actually to hit it. They also let me take a piece of the holy Cross; I set it upon the top of a credenza, fastened the holy Host to it, and then said: if he were the right, true God, he must show it, and would not allow himself to be so miserably dressed and tormented! And I know well that I did all this with particular rage, scorn and hatred. I, wretch, held this pious God worse than the thieves who were crucified with him; for I could not once get into my head that a God should thus allow himself to be nailed to a cross. Therefore when I once saw a procession with the holy Sacrament pass by my room, and then saw the people with their many lights and great devotion and reverence, I wondered greatly how it came about that so many people would strive to accompany such a thing, which to me was so utterly repugnant, indeed an abomination. \\[Page 119\\]\n\nAnd I began almost to laugh and to deride: Behold a wonder! how is it that the one whom the Christians worship is carried about by men; and moreover so mockingly and always in the shape of a naked man. Meanwhile they set up before me, by the one who called himself a sorcerer, all manner of panels and images, and they placed these their idols aloft with great reverence and diabolical singing; which, at that time, sounded very pleasing in my ears, and then I offered no canonical hour or prayer except what they put into my mouth.\n\nWhen these their idols thus stood forth in their glory, they made me step up to the first tier; thereupon they raised a great clamor and shouting; and I pledged them my fidelity, and never to worship any other god than those to which they should point me. After such an oath they embraced me with great joy, praised and exalted me to the highest --- thinking they had never bound any creature so firmly to themselves as they had bound me. They also often gave me great feasts, and told me with what unspeakable joy they would lead me from this life into that life.\n\nThey were exceedingly angry at the images of the saints; and I had to suffer severely if I uttered my customary prayer, which they had taught me, in their presence. They otherwise held very rigidly and strictly to their statutes; I also had to confess my transgressions to one of them; thereupon I was punished without any mercy; and one after another came and inflicted some torment upon me. When a commanded fast-day occurred, they brought me meat and forced me to eat it; even unclean animals they thrust into my body when I acted against their command. All high feast-days, the Christians' times of joy, were fast-days for me; I had also to perform all sorts of practices contrary to Christian rites. If I had not observed one, then they made me so hungry that I became as if furious and raging about it, and yet everything I tried to enjoy I had to give up again, until they were satisfied with their sport.\n\nIn such heavy servitude I led my life; one after another who called himself a god I had to obey for a day or a week at a time. Yet one always remained with me who brought me every sort of delight, joy and diversion; and that pleased me well, and I was of good cheer. Another, who called himself the spirit of true freedom, likewise kept close to me; and for several years they contrived so that they would gladly have brought me out of the cloister, but they were not able to do so.\n\nNow one came to me who gave me an image, wondrously prepared, and said: if this is to be the true god, to whom you shall sacrifice and serve, he shall be called Ninus. Such a proposal pleased me exceedingly, for he recounted to me in splendid words his power and authority in the world. Upon my assent he bade the others prepare the place for it. A whole host of them appeared, to whom I devoted my body, so that they might do with it altogether according to their desire and will. The wretched sorcerer-devil, whose services I had employed in this, now presented to me a palace by his specter. But to me it was nothing else but as if it were a glorious, wondrously beautiful temple; and in my eyes it seemed that no church could be compared to such temples. \\[Page 120\\]\n\nIn these temples I worshipped the idol which I myself had made by diabolical craft and instruction, and which thereafter was burned by the priests in the fire. Now one came to me who called himself the spirit of blood, saying: so that you might be altogether perfect and without blemish, you must not offer a dead but a living sacrifice from your own body. At this proposal I was appalled; I had never before seen this god of blood, as he called himself, and I rejected his demand.\n\nThen he threatened me strongly: he would make me a shame before the whole world; and the cursed villains tormented me so miserably that I had to obey their will at any time. Then a devil came with a great retinue who called himself Beleal, and to whom I was to sacrifice the victim. They set him with great reverence upon a splendid throne and waited on him for service. The blood-devil placed me before him and demanded of me that I, of my good, free will, give him power and authority to enter into my body, and from the same freely and unhindered take out the victim. From three parts of my body a piece was to be cut from each, which could not be done without gruesome pains, but great grace and rich reward would follow; for this work would have greater force and effect than anything I had ever done. I would then become like God, and they would afterwards cause me to be worshipped in God's stead. To such high promises I yielded to their will.\n\nThey now laid me upon a table, upon which I first had to spread a white linen cloth in order to catch the blood; and now, with my miserable pains, a piece was cut out which I wrapped in the blood and brought as an offering to Beleal. The same game was played with me for the next two days. Ah, what a painful sacrifice that was --- pain upon pain! --- and I also had to put on an outward show before the people as if I were burdened with some other bodily infirmity!\n\nMeanwhile many pious and Christian people often spoke to me worthily about the most holy Sacrament; I thought to myself: if I might see a sign of it, I would straightway worship it beside my other gods as well. That displeased the devils, and they punished me bitterly for it. They bade me take a host, of which I always had a supply; and I took it up to a place in the house. \"Now we will, make and command thee,\" they said, \"that thou now, in our presence, curse and deny it, and with drawn knife, out of spite and mockery, stab it through; then thou wilt see what little power it has, and how weaker it is than we.\" Then, with a hardened heart, I drew my knife and thrust it into the most worthy Sacrament. After that stab the blood immediately began to gush from it, and the chamber was filled with a bright radiance which surrounded the holy host; which then again was transported back to its place where the others were. Then I was very frightened, especially since all the bystanders at once fled away with frightful howling, tumult and trembling, and left me half dead behind. I then began to weep and to consider that I had truly been deceived and seduced by the devils; and when I reflected properly on the sign I at last fell quite into despair. \\[Page 121\\]\n\nThen the devils came raging to me, saying: they had indeed hitherto certainly deceived and seduced me; I had pierced the true God, whom they themselves acknowledged thereby; the sin which I had committed could not be forgiven; nothing remained for me but to do as Judas did and hang myself. Since they now also threatened to take my life, I consented to be hanged by them. They bade me go up upon the roof of the house and put my leather belt about my own neck. I did so, and gave them full power to deal with me according to their pleasure. There were a great number of them who disputed over my soul; they hoisted me up to strangle me. But however they attempted it, it was impossible for them to draw the belt tight about my throat. They ascribed this to the protection of a sodomitical wretch --- the so\u2011called St.\u00a0Mary Magdalene --- who defended me; and said I ought to yield myself to the loose harlot.\n\nI said it in plain words, for it seemed to me I was already half dead. But however cruelly they tormented me, and thrust into my belly, they nevertheless never were able to kill me. The murder-devil then said to me: I should thrust the knife into my throat; thereby I would inflict on myself the due punishment. But it was not possible for me to accomplish such a thing; for I could not bring my arm to my neck, however firmly a whole swarm helped me thereto. The girdle I had to give them, and they afterwards always kept it with them.\n\nI then returned downstairs, tired, weak, shattered, and half broken; was exceedingly sad, and ceaselessly what I had seen lay upon my mind; and I had to lie down to recover. They sent for the physician, and gave me medicines; but by bodily means I could not be helped. From that time forward it lay constantly on my mind that I would gladly have sought the opportunity to learn the truth concerning the venerable Sacrament. But because I was not myself, and could not use any of my limbs according to my will, they hindered me whenever I came before a priest; and caused that I straightway spoke the opposite, and set forth all manner of subtle, captious things.\n\nFrom that time on, whenever I went to the holy Sacrament, a trembling and a shudder assailed me: and it was finally perceived that I did not lead the life that a believing Christian and a person of the Order ought to live. Then counsel was taken in the convent to keep me confined in a separate room, and to consider counsel and means to reconcile me again with God. Yet at that time they could have no knowledge of all that had befallen me; and I led the most miserable life, desiring only to drown myself or to kill myself, if I could have found the opportunity. The nuns of the convent who saw me in that evil state had pity on me, comforted me, and spoke kindly to me. My words in return were so exceedingly awkward, rough and unfriendly, that they appeared unpleasant to them; therefore they had to leave me in my condition. \\[Page 122\\]\n\nMy lord, the Archbishop, came to our convent, and I wished to take refuge with him; but they so blinded my face that he appeared to me very stern and terrifying. They also once showed me the abyss of Hell, together with the punishment that I would have to suffer for each of my sins; I saw in a deep pit nothing but fire, darkness, intolerable stench, hellish dragons and serpents, one of which I must swallow, because I had received Communion on Holy Maundy Thursday. They have done all this to me out of their great malice, and all this is not fancy or imagination, but truly happened thus; for I know and confess that I committed the sins written above with my own body and my limbs, as I have told.\n\nBut the power and mercy of God, who never abandons his creatures in their distress, did not regard that I had gone far from him; rather he caused me to seek and run after help, and sent me Saint Mary Magdalene, who did not forsake me in all my greatest anguishes. To her praise and honor I have related what sort of life I led at the instigation of the devil; so that it may be made known to all the world what grace and help I obtained from this my intercessor and protector. As witnesses of this I take my God and Lord, the pious Lady and all the heavenly host; on earth, however, the Most Reverend Prince in God and Lord Archbishop of Cambrai, and all his priestly coadjutors; then all my fellow-sisters who have seen me.\n\nThus far the unfortunate woman's own handwritten report; but what occurred during the two years she was under spiritual treatment outwardly seemed to confirm completely what she afterwards reported about the state of her inner life. In her delusion she had at first made a prostration before the archbishop and begged his blessing. There her patron saint had appeared to her in great splendor, and to her terror, and to the consternation of her spirits, had received the blessing in her name. They then pronounced the exorcism over her, and compelled one of these spirits of hers to speak; and he confessed in all their names that they would be forced to depart by the merit of these saints.\n\nWhen it was soon noticed that the patient was utterly and entirely without faith, priests were appointed to her by the archbishop to instruct her in the knowledge of God. She, however, showed herself stubborn and contentious and disputed every point; and the archbishop had to have her sign the Creed with her own hand in order to move her to grant him some belief. She was then instructed in her conventual duties; the original of her profession document, which had been lost, had to be procured again, and she was required to make her profession a second time.\n\nThey led her then through all the churches and to all the relics of the diocese, and bathed her in holy water, through whose power and effect all manner of base and abominable things then issued from her: tufts of hair and many little creatures, like smoky worms, came from her --- all of which caused a very great stench. To curb her malice and to weary the enemies, she was put into a dark and narrow prison. But as the evil only grew, she was brought back into the sick-room, and Sister Barbara Deruillers was assigned to her as keeper. There the evil spirits tormented her severely again, so that she often screamed for three hours at a stretch. In the presence of her keeper she was hurled from the bed into the room, and with head, arm, or the whole body so fiercely thrown against the floor that one saw the marks everywhere. \\[Page 123\\]\n\nShe could often eat nothing for three days, and then they filled her mouth with poisonous vermin. Once she was dragged to the brook that runs just behind the convent and thrust under the water. The keeper cried for help, and they could not drown her; the fellow sisters pulled her out alive. Another time she was cast from her chamber out of the window onto the courtyard; again she was led to the highest rooms of the house in order to hurl her down from there as well. To guard against this, they resolved to bind her with strong straps and ropes to a stout wooden chair and to lay her arms crosswise in a stock; but all in vain. She slipped her body, arm and leg nimbly out of the bonds without any knot having been loosened or any wood having been displaced from its place; and then at midnight she was led to a part of the convent that is very narrow and to which few people ever come, where, after long searching, she was finally found.\n\nThen for a time she was made foolish so that she knew no one, and constantly said: \"I will die, I!\" and therefore would neither eat nor drink. Then she fell utterly silent and wept without cessation; at last she could neither sit nor lie down, but went like a madwoman pacing up and down the chamber. When a fast-day came, she could not take any food on the previous day; then on the day itself such a dreadful hunger came upon her that she would have eaten her own flesh. Thereupon, again in the presence of the priests, raw carrion was brought to her; and they filled her mouth with fetid blood and rotten flesh so that no one could endure being near her.\n\nNow, following an apparition of her patron saint, a kind of wall was built around her in her chamber; which prevented the spirits from coming to her past the middle of the room. Soon, in confession, they learned from her the pledges she had made to them, and these were wrung from her by the exorcism. Fourteen consecrated hosts, which she had gradually put aside, were returned; and among them was one with a bloody mark where the stab had gone through. A piece of the cross also had to be fetched again.\n\nShe finally relapsed once more, and pledged anew to her spirits that she would never abandon them; but soon after, by a new apparition of her patron saint, she was again brought back to the right way. Now the images of silver and of bell\u2011metal to which she had sacrificed were surrendered. When they immediately learned also what had been done with the cutting out of a piece of flesh from her body, the spirits were compelled to speak about it. At first they denied it, then said that the injury of the wounded would be mortal if they left her. But when the exorcism continued, the three pieces, wrapped in the cloth, were placed at the spot assigned to them. She was then tormented the whole night with unheard\u2011of pains, until at last in the morning they left her. \\[Page 124\\]\n\nShe remained free for three weeks or longer, during which, in the last nights, much blood and putrid flesh came from her. An almost strange condition in several places of her body then continued for another year and 23 weeks, with much pain. Her evil spirits were now by the exorcism gradually entirely separated from her. Only one, who had been the first and had then taken the father's place with her, would absolutely not depart. He told her that whatever she had hitherto said and done had all happened through him; if he therefore left her, she would come to notable shame, because she, who had all along been counted a reasonable, sharp\u2011witted person, would then no longer be able to speak a single word of her own.\n\nThis moved her heart and distressed her so much that she threw herself at the feet of her exorcist, begging him to let her at least keep that one. When he refused, she cried amid many tears: \"O what a bitter parting that is!\" Only when he promised her that he would be her father in the place of the one expelled---whom she afterward additionally set beside the archbishop as grandfather---did she permit that he too be expelled.\n\nNow the liberated woman had become truly natural, purely innocent, childlike in simplicity; she had become entirely ignorant, without any knowledge of God or of creatures; she could not utter any other words than: \"Pater! Haus! and beautiful Maria!\" With the image of the latter that was handed to her she played like a child with its doll, and spoke to it. They therefore had to take her again like a child into instruction, and first teach her to make the sign of the cross. By the archbishop's blessing her tongue had to be unloosed again to restore to her the use of speech. The same had to be done to all her limbs so that she might be able to walk properly again.\n\nA whole year was still appointed to her as a year of penance, during which she, being exposed to outward attacks of her spirits, had to suffer severe torment. Meanwhile she was taught again to read and to pray. At a comforting apparition of her patron saint, on the anniversary of the former one, her mind became keener; and she then received instruction, in part from the archbishop himself, in the catechism of Father Canisius, not without much wrangling and resistance on her part. For occasional relapses still occurred from time to time; in one of these she rushed so furiously with fists and feet at the archbishop that he had scarcely enough to do to save his life from her.\n\nWhen she came in the catechism to the doctrine of the Eucharist, she absolutely would not give credence to the truth of it; and it required a private vision to remove all her doubts. For four months she was then taught the choir-singing, which she mastered completely. Meanwhile her bodily injuries, arising from the suffering, had in silence again become so serious that they were obliged to summon the physician Cospeau and some women knowledgeable in female conditions to see whether they could not procure her some relief. The counsel which these, together with the physician, held amounted to this: the injury is mortal; the prescribed medicines, however, only caused her further torments; and it came to pass that within a few hours her death was expected. But after first many pieces of rotting flesh had come away, she was restored to her former state. After several times more demoniac ecstasies alternated with others of a higher kind, at last the crisis drew near. \\[Page 125\\]\n\nShe gathered all the clergy about her who had hitherto stood by her; they likewise summoned her convent-sisters so that all might be present with their prayers; and in the afternoon, at three o'clock, the struggle began in the presence of her patron saints. She faltered and trembled, and behaved as one in the last agonies; she spoke from time to time with her tormentors and answered their words. At times she cried out: They tear me apart, they tear me apart! Then she was again plunged into the utmost fear and pain. Thereupon she suddenly cried: Ah, how will it fare with me yet, I can no longer endure it!\n\nThey comforted her and strengthened her with prayers. Finally there came a tugging at the ceiling and a delirium like that of a dying person. When she was asked what she was beginning, she answered: She herself then lay down upon her pillow and lay there as in wide stillness, and the struggle was decided. The parts of her body which had been cut away and thereby separated and set apart were again joined together in their natural places, and all her pains ceased. Those present sang \"Herr Gott, dich loben wir\" (Lord God, we praise thee)! She displayed many wounds which she had received in the struggle, and showed the shirt that was full of blood; then prayed her hours and went with the sisters into the refectory to supper.\n\nOn 6 January 1586 she had yet one last convulsion, in which Mary Magdalene appeared to her, and she was wholly and forever freed. The course of events was then written down; that and the sister's writing were read before the apostolic and royal notary Godfried von Liere; in the presence of the archbishop, Dr.\u00a0Fr.\u00a0Buisseret, the official, the canon Goubille, Dean Hollo, Mansent, the canon of St.\u00a0Germain, Banay, canon of Andemie, the confessor of the convent, the sister Deruillers, former attendant of Johanna, the present abbess, the liberated woman herself, the physician Cospeau, one of the midwives, and finally some of the old convent-women; all of whom, so far as concerned them, confirmed the truth of what had been read as eyewitnesses; whereupon the summoned notary, with his own signature, on 6 and 7 February 1586 ratified the instrument. \\[Page 126\\"}, "The Imprisoned Witches Transported to the Sabbath": {"start_char": 438211, "end_char": 444046, "pages": "132-134", "keywords": ["instant transport to sabbath"], "verbatim": "ients themselves.\n\nDe Lancre says on this point: in Labourd one has consistently been of the belief that the ointment is prepared with the fat of children murdered before receiving baptism; and it has therefore been customary that novices in the witchcraft are allowed to have the prepared ointment shared with them by others; but that the further advanced must prepare it themselves, in order thereby to drive them to child\u2011murder. With still further advancement of the initiated, the ointment then finally became altogether needless.\n\nThe fiend Necato of Urrugne, the same reporter relates, as a prisoner went every night to the Sabbath; and I can assure you that she had neither grease nor ointment, nor the possibility of procuring any. For she sat confined alone in the chamber of an honest house; with her were 20--25 witnesses, who almost all likewise went to the Sabbath and slept in two other rooms of the same house. Three witnesses testified that they had been with her on the Sabbath at Lacua, on the coast of Hendaye, on the penultimate and the last July, 1600. They were answered that they were prisoners, and that therefore their statement must necessarily be an error; for they themselves had been in confinement on those nights and had had no ointment. We therefore confronted the witnesses and the accused with one another.\n\nA girl called Gastagnalde testified against Necato that Necato ordinarily brought her to the Sabbath herself, and that on that night she too had been carried through the air to that place, where Necato stood by her as godmother and struck her very hard. The accused at length admitted the charge as founded; the complainant had received the blows because she herself had struck a toad that had been handed to her to keep. Cristoval of Garalde, aged 15--16 years, added that, as a reward for having revealed everything the day before, he had, although like the other witnesses previously confined, been led by the fiend Marissans of Tartas to the Sabbath. She had swung him so high into the air that he did not recognize the place of the Sabbath. There he was cruelly mistreated, and he had also seen Necato strike that Gastagnalde; to which he added certain particulars. \\[Page 133\\]\n\nThe third, Aspileuetta, added that she, together with the previous witness, had been brought there by one who formerly used to lead her to the Sabbath, and had witnessed the same; which Necato in fact confessed anew upon repeated accusation. She further asserted that she had been brought one night toward Hendaye, where a small Sabbath was held. There also appeared Detsail, whom the judges already knew from other statements, that he there habitually carried the basin into which every attendee placed his offering or his penance; and he too sat then, in accordance with one of their dispositions, likewise in prison.\n\nThe Necato had accused him, and he therefore struck her hard in the assembly. At that time Monsieur Laurent de Moisset, advocate at the Parliament of Bordeaux, who sat with the rest of us in Bayonne to try these women, happened to be in Hendaye. There two women came to him who reported: Detsail, although in prison, had been at the assembly on the previous night, and there had struck the Necato with the utmost severity. Two girls from Hendaye, not far off, living near the place where the Sabbath had been held, had recognized her by her voice. They wished to be doubly sure of the matter, and had the Necato brought forward. She repeated the confession she had previously made. They also had Detsail brought forward, and she stood by her statement before him; at the same time averring that she had always seen him with the sacrificial bowl.\n\n1)  In the first case one might suspect an agreement among the witnesses, since they had been confined together; but the voluntary confession of the accused contradicts that suspicion. What remained of suspicion is again diminished by the cross\u2011test. The striker of before is now herself the struck one; and that she did not speak untruth is corroborated by the testimony of the two women, from the remote place, the scene of the whole transaction.\n\nWhatever therefore underlay it, it could not have been mere frenzy or malice; there must have been a condition present in all these people in which they all stood in an inward rapport; from which they then drew the truth and the concurrence that appeared in their statements. This condition was not here produced by the artificial means of anointing, since they all could not resort to the same; it must therefore have been habitual in them, and that is what we wished here to establish. This condition, whether brought about artificially or naturally, now begins with a sleep, to which there always follows an awakening; so that it is a lucid sleep that befalls those seized.\n\nWe asked, reports de Lancre, especially Maria Dindart of Sare, whether one could go to the Sabbath while awake. She replied: the truth is that one never goes to the Sabbath awake; one had slept beforehand; which is why one also goes to the churches, to keep watch there through the nights, and so prevent the departure. But it is perfectly sufficient to have only one eye lightly closed, and in the instant one is borne there. For it requires only the span of a nod of the eye, and however distant the place may be, whether it lie in the Terra Nova or at the end of the world, the sleeper finds himself transported thither.\n\nTheir statements, however, indicated that upon the preceding state of sleep another state of wakefulness follows; and that the rapture or transport then takes place in a perfectly waking condition, and not as an illusion, but entirely and wholly real.

Thus de Lanere relates from his interrogations: if the women wished to go to the Sabbath only in image and contemplation, they lay themselves down on the left side. If they then awoke, the demon caused them to emit a thick vapor from the mouth, in which they then perceived everything that occurred at the Sabbath, as if they saw it in a mirror. But if they wished to be bodily present there, they anointed themselves with an ointment of child's fat.\n\nOthers said again: artificial ecstasies, like those which the Indians produce by the herb cohoba, showed them the visions repeatedly. Then the spirit led the thus-initiate physically to the place; but even there it sometimes left them in doubt whether what had been shown to those led had happened in truth or by illusion. Thus three states, arranged one after another in gradual progression. The mere vision, brought about by a reflection, in a dark cloud that rises before the now clairvoyant inner eye. The deception in this image then approaches the truth by presenting itself as a reality; yet so that a doubt as to its reality remains in the seer.

All are marked, in order to distinguish them from those who do not belong to the fellowship; and this mark can be covered, but not removed without higher assistance than they possess.\n\nThe mark, however, consists in small spots on the surface of the body, never larger than a pea, which are insensible, without life and blood, while all around them they find themselves surrounded on every side by living flesh. They are sometimes recognizable by a red or black spot, or by a depression of the flesh, but sometimes also externally indistinguishable; and then only by knowledge of the place where they are usually set, or by an inner instinct of the experienced can they be found. If one pricks them with a needle, neither pain follows nor any drop of blood; whereas both appear immediately if one pricks round about them, or if one has gone deeper than where those insensitive bloodless spots lie.\n\nSuch numbed spots differ from those that have arisen from some disease in that the latter are widespread, usually lie on the extremities, the flesh softens and dissolves, and they remain visible in all cases; whereas the former often become invisible, harden in the flesh, in no way hinder the use of the organs, and can extend over the whole body. In Lorraine some had this sign on the forehead, others at the back of the head, on the breast, on the back, on the hips, on the eyelids, on one of the shoulders, and on the most secret parts of the body. They had received it without pain, at the hour when they had become apostate from the faith; and the marked spots were as rigid and bloodless as limbs struck by lightning. In Labourd more than three thousand such marked persons had been found, among them a great number of children who had been at the Sabbath. To many the marks seemed also to have a certain external shape: a small cloud, a toad's foot, a hare's paw, a spider, a dog's or a horse's hoof; which, however, Maria von Sains denies.\n\nThe mark that de Vaulr in Stablo had on his back was, according to the testimony of the investigating judge Oranus, in the shape of a black cat; when pricked it was insensitive; but if one threatened it from behind with a finger without his noticing it, then it pained him so that he broke out in lamentations. The Palud was, according to Gaufredy's account, marked on the head, heart, belly, thighs, legs and in other places; and Maria von Sains declared that, since the marking often recurs and also indicates the rank of the marked person in the synagogue, the place where the sign is attached depends on the abomination which the marked one practiced. Concerning the manner of the marking the various testimonies did not agree; for most had taken part in the act in youth and could no longer remember whether it had been the women who performed it upon them, or whether the master himself had impressed the mark.\n\nAmong the sorcerers from Castile he had used a needle of counterfeit gold. Gaufredy reported: a special demon was charged with it, who with the claw of the little finger presses the mark; one feels a slight warmth which penetrates more or less deeply into the flesh, according as the act was more superficial or more penetrating. According to others it was the horn that performed the service; and one sees that all agree in the fact of the signing, but differ among themselves about the manner and mode according to their subjective apprehension, the degree of their vision, and according to the notions they have formed of the whole matter in their testimonies.\n\nIf we hold to this fact, we here see presented the counterpart of stigmatization. When the inner life, the lowest region in man, makes its covenant with the Lord, then it wills to free itself from the power of spiritual death which has entered it through sin, and now, like a disseminated vacuum interrupting its steady continuity, leads outward through disease to physical death. But if this life turns to the other side and unites itself with the lord of darkness, then it itself, being given over to inner death, may be scattered into it, entirely lose itself to that chosen lord; so that, that death remaining victorious alone within it, all inner struggle and contradiction would be dissolved, and then, as dying ends, undisturbed immortality in non-being would begin.\n\nIn the first case, therefore, the life of the holy person is transformed into the higher source of life with which the covenant was made; so that, having been assimilated by it after the expulsion of the intruding evil and the malady, he may be inspired and exalted in his life, and thus a broad, light- and life-soaked wave may pulse through the great organism. In the other case transformation and assimilation occur in the opposite direction; the good and the living are expelled, while the evil, the night and death are drawn in; so that life may arrive at consolidation in the ice-streams of the abyss, as the depths "}, "Johanna d'Abadie's Testimony on Consuming Children's Corpses": {"start_char": 469720, "end_char": 470499, "pages": "141-142", "keywords": ["- d'abadie testimony on child consumption"], "verbatim": "are counted as the greatest delicacy.

Herbert, a contemporary of St.\u00a0Bernard --- round whom a whole world of visions disclosed itself --- tells us something like this of a friend of his youth, the hermit Dominicus. He had formerly lived in the Cistercian monastery Carrezeda near Le\u00f3n, and was then dismissed by the abbot into solitude, dwelling near that city in a mountain cave, practising the strictest continence; almost shut off from all intercourse with the world, devoting himself to contemplation; burning with love of God, and in a wonderful way endowed with the gift of tears.\n\nOnce he sat at the entrance of his cave, his gaze turned toward heaven, attentively following the light of a sunbeam to its source. Suddenly he perceived the shape of a burning dragon, which, descending in that very ray, in a violent plunge threw itself toward his face as if to devour it. Terrified by the apparition, he crouched inward; called on the Lord, and made the sign of the cross against the assailant. Driven off, it was yet able to do nothing against him, but it flew constantly about him and would not leave him. He then shut his eyes and covered his face with his garments; but that availed him nothing, for he saw the figure with closed eyelids as though with them open; and this penetrating, subtle being could not be repelled by clothing. When he saw, therefore, that he could not escape the sight, he opened his eyes again, and let them behold that whose attack he could not prevent. Then other demons likewise came to light in serpent form and other animal shapes, in hordes, and filled the dwelling from top to bottom.\n\nAmong them there was so great a diversity of dimensions, such variation in their properties, and such ugliness in their forms that it cannot be described, and many of them were fire-colored. They swarmed about him like bees, flared up like fire in a thorn-bush, dashing at him with angry movements and attacking him with blows. But although they appeared fiery, they by no means had the power to burn. For though they flew around him in a circle, and, sweeping past him at the swiftest speed, often struck his face, they did indeed press upon him in every way, but never harmed him with fire. When he then again went out somewhat before the door, to breathe somewhat from the oppression; there also appeared to him whole heaps of demons, in great swarms traversing the air, and filling everything from the earth to the heaven.

From then on, until the day of writing it down, the man of God saw these visions daily while awake; both in daylight and in the nocturnal darkness, with closed eyes just as with open. But the terror and the distress which he had at first entirely vanished; so that in the end he made no more of them than if they were flies or other vermin. For the light-spirits also visited him, and filled him with their consolations; however, about their forms he never, out of discretion, spoke to me.\n\nThese perceptions found themselves confirmed by others, from a monk of Clairvaux, whom Herbert does not name, because he was still alive at the time; who however had spent 40 years there in all holiness, and among other gifts also had such a lively inner eye: that with it, at a dying fellow brother, he saw the soul going out like a smoke from the censer, which then, when it had fully risen, remained hovering for a time in a round-clumped little cloud, transparent and about the size of a bushel, four to five ells above the corpse; until the brothers who had hurried there completed the funeral rites.\n\nThis one now, as often as he looked up into the air with a sharper gaze, likewise beheld, with his bodily eyes, in broad daylight swarms of demons roaming everywhere; in such numbers that their count could not be estimated. They appeared in manifold forms; one of these misshapen ones however was predominant. According to their bodily outlines they seemed to be monstrous men, of giant stature, black as Moors, nimble as serpents, wild as lions. They had thick heads, misshapen bellies, and were besides crooked and hunchbacked, with long and thin necks; while arms and legs likewise stretched themselves beyond all measure in length. When they halted somewhere in the air, then he could distinctly distinguish their forms, limb by limb; but if they roamed about in it with agile movement, then he saw nothing of them but mere larval shadows and tangles of whirlwinds.\n\nOn bright days, when the sun in its full power shines through the airs, then he was accustomed to see these visions the best, and to distinguish them the most clearly. When however he once also spent deep into the night in prayer, suddenly the hairs of his body began, in night terror, to bristle; and he saw masses of these demons crowding through the doors, and filling the whole house; so that piled up everywhere, they struck at the one praying. He made use of the sign of the cross and the angelic salutation, and thereby drove all the boisterous guests out of his oratory. In the following night he heard them again striking violently against the wall; and when he looked up, he saw in the window One, winged like a griffin or ostrich, standing, threatening him with its assault, which he however drove away in the same manner"}, "Maria de Ralde's First Encounter with Satan at the Sabbath": {"start_char": 556891, "end_char": 557441, "pages": "167", "keywords": ["- cries 'not one will betray me' at sabbath"], "verbatim": "rbidity or clarity of the beholding.\n\nMaria de Ralde, who since her tenth year had visited the Sabbath, but for five years had given up the abomination, testified: she had there seen the Satan for the first time in the form of a tree stump, without feet.

The following case, which Remy recounts, appears to decide the question affirmatively. When Nicolaa Laghernhard from the Garminger Mill went to Assencauria in August 1590, and was walking along the edge of a forest at bright midday, she saw in the adjacent field a circle of dancing men and women who, however, turned their backs to her. When she looked more closely, she noticed among the dancers some interspersed whose feet appeared to her shaped like goat feet. Half-dead with fright, she called out the name of Jesus and prayed that she might return safely and unharmed to her home. In an instant, all the dancers vanished, with one exception: Peter Grospetter by name, who also quickly ascended into the air, but in the ascent let fall a baker's brush, with which bakers are accustomed to clean the oven before inserting the bread. She herself was likewise seized by a violent gust of wind, so that she could scarcely draw breath; and when she arrived home, she lay sick in bed for three days. The talk spread quickly among the people from her relatives; and Peter, so as not to give the appearance of confirming the truth of the story through his silence, lodged a vehement complaint about it with the judge---but then let it drop, in order not to expose himself through the trial to greater prolixities and dangers. This increased the suspicion against him, as it was attributed to a bad conscience. The judge therefore inquired all the more earnestly into the life he led and his morals; and since he found sufficient cause, he had him arrested and brought him to a confession that was not entirely unwilling, as well as to the naming of those who had been with him. Among these were Barbel, the wife of Johann the stonemason from Dusa, and Mazetta, the wife of Lorenz from the same place, who in February and March 1591 confirmed his statements about the Sabbath and the spirits rubbed into the dance. To their testimony was now added another confirmation. Michael, the herdsman from Dusa, testified: he had been present at the affair as a piper, in that he had placed a round shepherd's staff to his mouth and fingered it around as if on a pipe. But when that Nicolaa, trembling, had called out \"Jesus!\" and thereby signed herself with the cross, he had fallen down from the high branch of the oak on which he had been sitting, and then been seized by the whirlwind and carried to the meadow where he had just before been tending the herd. For further confirmation of these statements, the place where the round dance had been performed was found trampled, as in a riding school where the horses go; but interspersed were traces of goat and cattle feet. These remained visible even when, in the following autumn, the plot was plowed under.

All who visit it find the time so short amid sheer lust and pleasure that they part from it only with regret and always feel a longing within themselves to return to it. Maria de la Ralde, a very beautiful woman who otherwise had not visited it for five years, likewise spoke of the yearning that had driven her there; so that, when she had been called to it, it had felt to her as if she were to go to a wedding.\n\nIt was not due to the freedom and licentiousness enjoyed there, as she herself stated that she had never seen whoring or fornication there; but because the spirit binds her heart and will in such a way that it allows scarcely any other desire. Furthermore, the companions held the Sabbath to be a place where a hundred thousand wondrous and unheard-of things can be seen, and so many various, melody-rich instruments can be heard, that they believe themselves enchanted as if in an earthly paradise. 1)\n\nAt court they often questioned her: what attraction the Sabbath could possibly hold for her, since even merely hearing of its abominations and its filth makes the skin shudder? But she replied without concealment: they hear and see all these abominations with a wondrous lust and a raving desire to be present at them; the interval from day to night, when they could set out on the journey, seems to her all too long; the hours until then creep by for them with unbearable slowness, but there, in the enjoyment of so many delights, they pass with all too swift haste. All the abominations, all the terrors and shadows pass by so lightning-like quickly, and vanish so suddenly, that no displeasure or pain finds time to master their soul or body. Thus nothing remains behind but the feeling of astonishment at so much that is new pressing in upon them, satisfying their curiosity, and satiating all their desires, whether of amorous or vengeful kind.

Those from Castile reported the following on the matter: When the assembly is together on the Prado del Cabron, the goat meadow; then the women offer these children to the Master while kneeling, with the words: Great mighty Lord! whom I worship, I bring you this new servant, who wishes to be your slave forever!

Moreover, the women are beaten and scourged if they bring no children; that they, for the sake of peace, fetch them from other villages and regions; so that some in Mohra brought 15--16 children with them every night to the Sabbath. The children from E\u00fcfdal knew much to say: of a white angel who forbade them to carry out what the devil had assigned them to do, and said thereby: the mischief shall not be overlooked much longer. On account of the base, dissolute life of the people, the matter had been tolerated hitherto; but now everything must be revealed.

Answer again: Yes! Then will and do what I will and do! Thereupon the Queen of the Sabbath, who leads up the neophyte, says to him: Then speak after me with a loud voice: 'I deny God first, then Jesus Christ, his Son, the Holy Ghost, the Virgin, the Saints, the holy Cross, the Chrism, the Baptism and the faith that I have hitherto held, my godparents, and I deliver myself up in all things to your power, and into your hands; I acknowledge no other God, so that you are my God, and I your servant.'?\" \\[Page 178\\]\n\nThen a toad is handed over to him in its full state, and the master commands him to worship it; and now the usual homage is rendered on the knees with the kissing. Then the baptism is scratched off for him with the claws of the left hand on the forehead, and in its place the stigmatization is applied with a false gold needle in the white of the left eye, or also elsewhere; which thus stands here equivalent to the circumcision in the old covenant. The pains that this operation arouses are allayed in particularly favored ones by a herb that the master gives them. The oral promise is sometimes repeated in writing later on. The vow that Gaufredy had made read, according to the records of his trial, as follows: Je Louis Gaufredy renonce \u00e0 tous les biens, tant spirituels que corporels, qui me pourroyent estre confer\u00e9 de la part de Dieu, de la vierge Marie ei de tous les saincis de Paradis, pareillement de mon Patron S.

This wish is fulfilled for us by that Magdalena Bavent, who played the leading role in the notorious history of the possessed nuns of Louviers. She had been seduced by her own temperament and the influence of bad priests who served as confessors at her convent; she had taken part in all the horrors of the debaucheries there, and when the consequences of them erupted in that affair; then all the possessed had testified against her as the instigator; the episcopal authority had conducted the investigation, but the Parliament of Rouen had taken the judgment in the matter to itself and pronounced a death sentence; Bavent, however, who faced the same fate, was still held once more in her prison. In this situation, she had come to repentance over her licentious life, and her confessor, the priest of the Oratory of the Marais, had induced her to compose a short history of it, in the form of final and testamentary confessions. She based it on the last confession she had made when she had to prepare herself for the impending death; her confessor assisted and guided the pen; and thus these memoirs of the forty-year-old woman arose. Calmly, as it seems, they are written with all the signs of serious repentance; concealing nothing of what might redound to her shame, rejecting only what seemed exaggerated to her in the accusations; and thus, with all the faithfulness and reliability that can be expected of a human being in such circumstances, sketching a picture of her aberrations. Regarding the closed Sabbath of her fellow members of the order, she now lets herself be heard there, p.\u00a023 and following, as follows:\n\nDuring my imprisonment in this city, I have, on the basis of my earlier statements, been approached by many people for more detailed information about the Sabbath. But my confessor had forbidden me to explain myself on this to anyone other than the judges; therefore I remained silent, a silence that brought me much humiliation from the side of the unsatisfied curiosity, which now refused to believe in my conversion. \\[Page 186\\]\n\nNow, since I have permission to speak about it, I will give all necessary information on the matter; so that everyone may recognize the gravity of my terrible crimes, and learn to abhor the scene of them. It is for me in this to recount with sincerity what I believe I have seen; the readers will, according to their best judgment in my report, distinguish what they hold to be real from what seems to them illusion. --- I was never carried off otherwise than at nighttime, and after I had slept. Usually before Matins, which with us took place at midnight, it seemed to me once, twice, sometimes in longer indefinite intervals, as if I were called by a nun. I started up from sleep to answer; and when, rising, I came to the door of my cell, I felt myself led away from there, without being able to distinguish how or by whom; for I had lost all consciousness, until I arrived at the accursed place. My rising, as my confessor later observed, provided the occasion for the abduction; I myself, however, did not think of it at the time. Ointment or anything else I never used, but it happened through the power of Picard; of my own self, even if the greatest desire drove me to present myself there, I would not have been able to do it.\n\nAfter an absence of one, or one and a half, two, or three hours, I found myself again in my cell, and lay down to bed. The place where the Sabbath was held, whether inside or outside the cloister, is unknown to me; I did not perceive the details with sufficient clarity to be able to make a description of it; I would therefore be deceiving the world if I were to sketch a drawing of it. I remember only that the place was rather narrow than spacious; there were no seats there on which to settle, but it was lighted, because of the lights that stood like torches on the altar. The company that appeared there was not numerous; only priests and nuns did I see there, laypeople seldom; perhaps it was not their Sabbath. The evil spirits were frequently present, in half-human, half-animal form, sometimes alone in the former; Picard, in whose presence I always found myself there, pointed them out to me expressly each time. I never saw them, as the nuns were accustomed to recount, in the form of a goat; their place was always near the altar; yet I never perceived any worship rendered to them.\n\nWhen I speak of the altar, it is because there really was such a one, where the priests said Mass; and the evil spirits stood so near the altar because it was said in their praise; I, however, perhaps saw no worship, though it was, as my confessor said, the highest of all. The host was like ours, yet it always seemed reddish to me and without figure; of this I can judge, because there too one communed. One also performed the elevation, and I heard terrible blasphemies uttered during it. The Mass was said with the paper of blasphemies, which one read aloud in it as the canon, as well as at all consecrations and processions, and which contained the most frightful curses against the most holy Trinity, the holy altar sacrament, the other sacraments, and the ceremonies of the Church, and which was written in a language unknown to me. \\[Page 187\\]\n\nWhen one holds banquets, which however, to my knowledge, happened only once or twice, human flesh is eaten thereat. I have also seen there a kind of register, but written in a script unknown to me, which seemed most to resemble that in the testament of the priest David, which was presented to me in court. Picard has indeed spoken to me of a list of the malefactors and the sorcerers, but he has never communicated it to me. The justice has asked me many times for the names of those present at the Sabbath; but I say in truth: these names are not spoken at the places of terror; one thus does not learn them there, unless one has acquaintance with them from elsewhere; to which my secluded life afforded me no opportunity. Everyone is also so occupied there with his own godless doings that he pays little heed to others; unless he is connected with them in some other way, as I was with Picard. Of the speeches made on the spot, I also know little; for aside from the public acts, speaking is done only softly, for the sake of secrecy.\n\nI am in general not so knowledgeable in the mysteries of darkness as one believes; this writing of mine is a kind of open confession, in the face of the Church of God, for some atonement for the scandal that I have given; and it shall contain only truth, and come as close as possible to that which I shall one day lay before my higher Judge. Besides Picard, whom I have always seen there with me, and without whom I was never present there, I have also recognized his vicar Boull\u00e9; beside them several priests, whose names I do not know, engaged in the ceremonies there; then also four nuns of my convent: Catharina of the Cross, Catharina of St.\u00a0Genevieve, Elisabeth of the Nativity, and Anna Barre; the latter, however, seldom. Of the others whom I glimpsed there by face, without knowing their names, two in particular have stuck in my mind: one 50--60 years old, clothed in violet, black hair mixed with gray, of middle stature, stout, but ill on his feet; and another, concerning whom I have always been questioned, and of whom the nuns have testified under exorcism: that it was Mother Franziska or Simonette of Paris, the former superior of the convent of St.\u00a0Louis, who had then withdrawn to the capital. She was never named to me at the Sabbath, however, and I have also never known her personally; and I wish from my heart never to have seen her there.\n\nAll the acts that I have seen performed at the Sabbath are dishonorable; and it is impossible that I should recall them otherwise than with shuddering. Those who question me about the particulars do not know what pain they thereby inflict on me; my confessor himself has questioned me, on account of the shame and confusion in which he has always seen me thereby, only about the barest necessities. So much is certain: the saints of God do great things; but the unholy ones of the devil yield to them in nothing on the other side. The wickedness of the priests who attend the Sabbath drives them at times to read mass over large hosts, then to cut them out in the middle, to paste them onto a parchment prepared in like manner, and then to use them in shameful ways for their lusts. In such things I have indeed only once or twice participated, and it would be better to make such abominable vices forgotten than to bring them to mind; but since I here lay my general confession, I cannot pass over them in silence. \\[Page 188\\]\n\nOn a Maundy Thursday, Picard and Boull\u00e9 had brought four hosts; they took two into their mouths, gave then two others to that aforementioned Simonette and to me, and finally they exchanged the ones taken; that served to strengthen the bond. One night, after the paper of blasphemy had been carried in procession for a while, a small cross was brought in, to which a large host was fastened with small nails at the hands and feet of the figure depicted upon it; at the same time, each of us had also to wound the side. Two or three drops of blood flowed out, which were collected and, combined with the host, used for magical purposes. This means, without doubt, crucifying the Lord a second time; as I then often saw the like practiced, even on hosts that had been consecrated on the Sabbath, though from these no blood flowed.\n\nA priest once brought a host to the Sabbath to burn it; but this time the Savior himself appeared and struck the priest with his lightnings, so that nothing more of him could be found; the host, however, shot up into the air. The demons fled, all was in consternation; but this established example by no means put an end to the assemblies. I saw another priest carry a chalice with the blood of the Lord to the Sabbath. He thrust a knife into it, which became entirely bloody. A second did likewise, and the substance likewise turned to blood; and when a third repeated the act, it overflowed from the overfull chalice onto the earth. The Lord, in the company of the Holy Virgin and several saints, came thereunto and commanded the fleeing demons to remain. The priests were turned to ashes and seen no more; but the blood was collected with the earth and carried away. If these things thus occurred in reality---over which I leave the judgment to others---so are they great abominations, and alongside them great miracles; and my conviction of the real presence of the Savior in the holy sacrament has, through all these events wherein earth and hell have united in their rage against him, only been strengthened. \\[Page 189\\]\n\nOn a Good Friday a woman brought her newborn child; they resolved to nail it to a cross. The nails were driven through hosts, through which they nailed it fast; other nails were driven into its head as a crown, just as they also pierced its side; thereafter it was used for maleficia. Two persons who had perhaps strayed to the Sabbath out of curiosity were, because they refused to take part in its godlessnesses, crucified and killed there. On a Maundy Thursday I saw the Coena performed in a terrible manner. They brought a completely roasted child, and it was eaten by those present; I do not know with complete certainty whether I took part in it. I said to my confessor: it may well have been so; yet it seemed to me that I soon desisted, because the flesh seemed very tasteless to me. During the meal a demon went around the table and cried: Not one among you will betray me! I believe they repeat with these words the promise they gave one another not to betray each other, but to remain faithful to the devil. That is all that has remained in my memory with certainty from the Sabbath, after I have carefully searched my conscience and been questioned about it very often. One must not believe that more can be asked of me than I told my confessor, as he prepared me for death. The judgment over the reality of these things I leave to the discernment of others; but I beseech the justice, if it takes regard to my testimony, only to pay attention to what I can say with certainty. As long as Picard lived, I was moreover always led to the Sabbath.---Remarkable in this report is the threefold repetition: how she does not know whether all that was seen was thus in reality, or whether it only appeared so to her; a doubt whose good foundation we shall discuss elsewhere.\n\nAlso what is of importance, that in their prescriptions, where they demand back a part of their body, which the spirit, as with the Ferry, has taken from her under great pains--- what Picard called a flesh knot for the maleficia--- first she herself speaks, and then lets the demon reply; and likewise the acceptation of their bill of exchange drawn on body and life, which Astaroth adds. When the confessor asked her about this circumstance, she replied: she had not known what she had written, since she had been"}, "The Liturgy of the Sabbath According to Maria von Sains": {"start_char": 624859, "end_char": 629232, "pages": "190-191", "keywords": ["- of tournay arrest of maria von sains"], "verbatim": "\nAfter these revelations about the service, as it is celebrated on the Sabbath, that which Maria von Sains has stated about the rituals there is only the consequence of the once-adopted principle; and it matters little whether, in these statements--- which may very well be so--- the lucubrations and brooding thoughts of the waking state have imagined themselves into the demonic hell-sleep; or whether, conversely, the visions of this sleep have mirrored themselves in the remembrance of wakefulness.

Not all priests are admitted to the sacrifice; only twelve out of all are chosen, to perform it in the order prescribed by the master. Every Sunday the attendees are sprinkled with the blood of the Lord, under the general outcry: Sanguis ejus super nos et super filios nostros! In the mass a thousand unworthinesses are committed: Some stick out their tongues, others blaspheme, others uncover their nakedness; all of which becomes even more boisterous at the elevation, since then the demons and the notables of the society, turning their backs to the sacrament, approach the altar.

Credo in spiritum sanctum Leviathan, et Ecclesiam sanctam Catholicam, reformatam Synagogam, Communionem sanctorum, Remissionem peccatorum, et vitam aeternam, Amen. The Sabbath also keeps the ten commandments: Luciferum ut Deum verum adorabis, et alium extra ipsum non amabis. Nomen Jesu assidue blasphemabis. Sabbata Synagogae sanctificabis. Patrem ac matrem odio habebis. Viros pariter ac mulieres, puerosque trucidabis. Adulteria, et omnem fornicationem et crimina nefanda committere non dubitabis. Usuras, furta atque rapinas exercebis. Falsa testimonia ac mendacia dicundo praeelectabis. Uxorem proximi tui et possessionem proximi tui concupiscis. \\[Page 191\\]\n\nAs works of mercy are considered: to refuse food, drink, and clothing to the poor, not to take in the stranger, to abandon the weak and the imprisoned, to dig up the buried children for the Sabbath, to sow errors and heresies, to multiply doubts and scruples, to burden the afflicted with even greater affliction, to make those who have fallen into sin fall even deeper, not to pray for the deceased, to bear adversities with impatience. Mortal sins are held there to be: to live in humility, chastity, patience, moderation, compassion, and piety. For all virtues count as vices: extravagance stands in for chastity, gluttony for moderation, envy for neighborly love, avarice for generosity, pride for humility, impatience for long-suffering, and so too blasphemy for fortitude. Litanies are likewise held there, and in them, for example: *Ut Ecclesiam Catholicam apostolicam Romanam, per haereses turbare et destruere digneris, te rogamus audi nos*; *ut Ordines ac Religiones difformare et extirpare digneris*. --- *Ut congregationes nostras conservare in sanitate ab omni malo digneris*. --- *Ut rabiem nostram contra Deum et homines et Sanctos, qui sunt et futuri sunt, semper fovere digneris*. --- *Ut nos in cordis nostri duritie perpetuo retinere digneris*. --- *Ut nobis auxilium dones, ad resistendum semper spiritui sancto et divinis eius inspirationibus et admonitionibus, et quicquid saluti nostrae deseruire posset*. --- *Te rog"}, "Beelzebub's Sermon on Trinity Sunday": {"start_char": 629203, "end_char": 631229, "pages": "191-192", "keywords": ["- sermon on trinity sunday"], "verbatim": "eseruire posset*. --- *Te rogamus audi nos*.\n\nOne sees that much from this ritual is still today useful for the secret service of many a doctrine that has purified the Sabbath, after cleansing it of all superstition and the ridiculous abstractions of the Middle Ages, and setting it upon tangibility, now holds it in broad daylight on the open market. Also a sermon that Beelzebub held on Trinity Sunday would be very useful; if one were to seat at the throne, instead of the obsolete three demons of the speaker, Leviathan's, and Asmodeus's, who sat there at that time --- their faces like a man's face, body, feet, and hands of a devil's feet, each with horns on the head, a golden tiara like the high priest --- three God-men: the God-philosopher, in whom pantheism has incarnated itself; the God-pleasure-seeker, husband of the exalted Lady Sophia of the Saint-Simonists; and the God-emperor of this world, in whom absolute liberal tyranny has become flesh.\n\nThe three could then speak from one mouth with the orator: My friends, today the great day of the most holy Trinity shines forth in humanity. We three are one in essence, but in substance completely equal to one another; almighty, because the three kings of the world; all-knowing, precisely because we ourselves are the All. In a word, we are able to bring forth everything, and again to transform it into nothing. *Filioli mei, vestrum est omni conamine sanctissimam trinitatem coeli contemnere: vestrum est, contemnentes dicere: Draco crudelissime, serpens venenose, Cerbere triceps!* Rejoice, my sons, that you have brought forth from your midst a God, threefold in person but one in full union; who in the first has freed you from all your superstition in the being of a supernatural God and his entire court; who in the second has overwhelmed you with all delights and blessed you with the liberation of the flesh; who in the third has freed you from all the needs of free will, and directed you to your true Lord, fate.

Atmospheres and Modes of Action in the State of Enchantment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[Page 192\\]\n\nThose who have turned themselves toward the nocturnal side of nature have there found the star of the night; and by setting themselves in rapport with it through their abdominal cerebrum, which is itself a moon in the organic body, they have become moonstruck from the side of nature, and the moon, moving them in ebbs and flows, has drawn them up to itself, but in truth down beneath itself. In this direction of nature, which has made them moon-women if they belong to the other sex; or such as conduct themselves in the manner of women if they were men who have turned aside to this side; the realm of death is unveiled to them in clear sleep, that realm which hides itself in the midst of the realm of life and encompasses within itself all the lower roots of being; and they now behold the rising and descending of the elements in the alternating intercourse of both realms. In this natural relation of such moon-wives, the mythical has been added in antiquity; in those nocturnal domains they have found Hecate, the terrible night-goddess, who, as the moon has three forms, so has a threefold countenance. She has been to them the guardian of all night-births, the ruler in the angle named after her, that great cave on the moon's disk where the departed obtain punishment for their wickednesses. She was to them the wrathful one who drives the night-wanderer along his paths; she has unlocked for them the underworld of the departed, which adjoins that realm of death; and thus the moon-women of antiquity have become necromantic sorceresses when they have turned to the evil side. In Christendom, where all relations of nature are spiritualized, and in this spiritualization the opposition of the religious-ethical good and evil is purely and sharply driven forth, those sorceresses, passing through the domain of nature and the psychic, have turned even more decisively to the final side. By taking the demonic as their center, and nourishing themselves physically with the shadows of substances, but spiritually satisfying themselves with the empty semblances of ideas, and working all this into somnambulistic illusory movements; they have likewise had to transpose themselves, formally transubstantiating themselves into the object of their choice, out of truth into the lie of a semblance-existence; which, however, in the concrete reality of evil, has nonetheless attained its negative reality as a contradiction against the positive of the good"}, "The Demonic Priests and Nuns of Louviers": {"start_char": 639661, "end_char": 647474, "pages": "194-196", "keywords": ["degenerate priests in louviers"], "verbatim": "In the demonic rapportages, as whose tangible and visible central points they appear, they are masters of the throng that presses around them; and they form around themselves the dioceses of that rebellious church which descends into the realms of downfall.\n\n#### A. The Mystagogues of the Enchantment-Being\n\nIf someone has attained the consecration of the spirit of midnight, and the seven-parted ray of the darkness dwelling within him has come over him, then he becomes its vicar; the nights stream together in him, so that in the midst of their gloom he becomes a blacker, night-enveloped point that engulfs the light, and binds to himself all spirits that enter into the current, and henceforth appears as their central point and their leader and their master. Of such a kind was that succession of degenerate priests in Norman Louviers, of whom we have already made mention earlier: David, Picard, Boulle, who, by handing down their mandate---the canon of blasphemies---from one to the other on the deathbed as a hereditary bequest, transmitted their consecration to one another, and thus formed a whole lineage of such mystagogues.\n\nThey were Ophites, after the manner of that ancient Gnostic school, who, abusing the inexperience of the girls shut up in that convent in the most wicked way, endeavored to gradually divert their zeal for advancing on the path of the inner life into their own ways. They spoke to them of contemplation, inner light, ecstasies, transformations, self-annihilations, and of the hidden life in the spirit; they ceaselessly urged them on to rise to that spirituality which would lead them to the choirs of angels, and finally even into God himself. Then they would be exalted above the law, living only in love, comforted by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and free in the freedom of the Lord, and established in this freedom, they need no longer heed the stirrings of the passions in the deeper regions; but mortifying all shame and timidity, they would find themselves empowered to give free rein to sensuality; because a spirit most intimately united with God could never sin.\n\nThus combining the highest spiritual tension with the deepest profligacy, they must gradually gain the greatest power over the spirit of those who had been incautiously surrendered to them; all the more so, since the seclusion and solitude of the conventual life at once furthered and concealed the designs of the seducers. This spiritual dominion soon manifested itself physically as well. One of the nuns testified later against Picard: that when he once unexpectedly touched her on the side with the tip of his finger, she immediately felt a violent pain at that spot, which thereafter persisted constantly, and intensified every time relics were brought near the place; moreover, since that moment a violent agitation had seized her whenever she went to communion or beheld the magician. \\[Page 195\\]\n\nMagdalena Bavent testified against him: how she had seen in his hands a register, consisting of three closely written sheets, into which he had inscribed the names of those whom he boasted of ruling, or who had assisted him helpfully in his misdeeds. All these had their intention directed toward him; he formed the center in which all these directions met, and mediated their connection with the root-like Evil. Just as in the Savior the highest ground, the supernatural moment, is present, while in the spiritually heightened nature of the Saints the natural element of all visions of the heights prevails; so likewise in the root-like Evil does the higher---or rather deeper---ground of all demonic visions lie, the Sabbath included; and in the central nature of such magical mystagogues, more closely bound up with it, the natural vinculum prevails, in which everything connects itself into a whole.\n\nIf now the outer waking life, in all earthly relations, has its logical categories, in which it comprehends all natural effects; then the inner life, whether in light-sleep or in dark-sleep, likewise has its own, in which it comprehends the inner impressions. The color and application of these categories, belonging to the subjective human being, will change with his nature and mood; while that other overarching moment, essentially always the same, takes the fleeting change in the visions---arising from subjectivity---and always directs it enduringly toward the same point, thereby fixing it. Thus will it also be arranged around the Sabbath. In its innermost essence built up around the core of Evil, it is among the peasants predominantly grasped in the character of the Venusberg and a raw debauchery; in the midst of a warlike knighthood it would have assumed the form of a wild hunt and a hellish Valhalla. Here around Picard, and with his retinue, under the enclosure of cloistered nuns, it has---as we have seen---taken the form of an abyssal monastery, in which every sort of blasphemy and desecration of the Holy is practiced. What in the novitiate partly occurred in reality has, in the vision, only been heightened. Especially with Bavent was the degenerate priest closely bound, and one sees clearly that both had concluded a demonic marriage with each other, and that the Sabbath was the foundation on which they built their house. Therefore it is he who, in his patriarchal power, always abducts her to the Sabbath according to his intention; she finds herself there, always inseparably at his side, just as others hold to others---the same persons always meet there together. But she beholds everything always in and through her leader. \\[Page 196\\]\n\nThe Logos in the human being, when in the saints it binds itself more closely to the Logos in God, and in greater proximity to the light also greens forth in its own heightened vegetation and ramifies; has there---as we have noticed---formed its own mystical language. The same Logos, when in the underground shafts, in the proximity of the shadowing principle, torn asunder and cleft in sickly drive-force, will likewise acquire its own idiom. That we see returning here also in the relation of this marriage, concluded under a curse; an own language has formed among the companions, and this has formed its own secret script, which only the initiates understood how to read. The nuns said of her: she had given birth four times on the Sabbath; a testimony that she does not accept, probably because she did not grasp that it happened in the spirit. This marriage was concluded, moreover, for life and death; indeed, beyond death, she would have roused the audacity for it within herself. \"In the night of the day on which Picard died,\" she herself recounts to us, \"I was abducted to the barn of Mesnil-Jourdain, five quarter-hours from the monastery, to his corpse. He was at the edge of a grave, and the vicar Boulle raised him somewhat by the shoulders; many demons were gathered around the body.\"\n\nHe urged me thus: it was now time to fulfill my promise to share the same fate with him. I was ordered to seize him by the feet, which I found very cold. I was told to descend three steps into the pit toward him; but when I saw frightful flames therein, I quickly climbed back out, declaring that I had never promised to be damned with him, and that now, having come to my senses, I must take thought for my own salvation; whereupon I was led back to my cell. Twice more I was later brought to him, saw his corpse, and beside it a frightful beast.\\\" She had already earlier shared in the sufferings of the dying man, which appeared to her quite naturally in the form of demonic temptations; after the hour of death had passed, there came the admonitions to restore the rapport, beyond life, through the conclusion of a marriage. But now, frightened by the flames, she breaks loose from the bond, rends the tie "}, "Louis Goffredy's Demonic Pact and Seduction of Magdalena": {"start_char": 647474, "end_char": 653841, "pages": "196-199", "keywords": ["- gaufredi seduction of magdalena"], "verbatim": "asunder, and the Sabbath is henceforth sunk from her sight. What we have here shown by the example of Picard and of Bavent can likewise be traced into others; although, to our knowledge, in no second case do recorded reminiscences of one of the parties involved permit us deeper insights into the nature of the contracted relation. The Proven\u00e7al Louis Goffredy of Beauvezer had, by his own confession, among other things received from his uncle a book on magic, which at first he had not esteemed, but whose spells he one day attempted. \\[Page 197\\]\n\nThen the invoked spirit appeared to him, talked him out of his scruples against a pact, and concluded such a one on the condition that, in return for the threefold surrender of his soul, his body, and all his actions, he would render him threefold service: to make him the most honored of all priests in Provence; to grant him 34 years of life without illness or other affliction; and to inflame in his name all women whom he breathed upon with love for him. He now goes to Marseille and obtains there, at the church of the Accoules, a benefice. The fame of his holiness soon fills the region; all women crowd to his confessional, and he now finds opportunity to apply the magic of his breath, more than a thousand times, as he says, and rejoices as all around bursts into love for him. The wife of the innkeeper Perrin was brought so far that a palpitating heart announced to her his approach from afar each time; another, named Bouchette, and a third, named Pintade, likewise became, one after another, victims of his lusts. But preeminently the three daughters of a nobleman, Mandals de la Pallus, and among them especially the then ten-year-old Magdalena, had aroused this lust of his, because his reputation had granted him free access to the house. Since the girl had taken him as her confessor, he had already in this relation allowed himself many liberties with her, and a deep melancholy had developed in her from such intercourse. She often lived on an estate near the city, and he too went there back and forth. First he breathed upon the mother, so that she too was won over and led the daughter to the seducer; whom he himself likewise so often made to feel the power of his breath, and whom moreover he assailed multifariously with other magic, until she, meanwhile advanced in age, yielded herself to him. When he once found her alone on the country estate, he induced her to accompany him to a cave near the estate, where he promised to show her great wonders. There they found many men and women engaged in dancing around the goat. Magdalena at first felt a great terror, but Goffredy gave her courage: they were only her friends whom she saw gathered here, and whose company she henceforth should belong to. \\[Page 198\\]\n\nHe had previously told her: for her sake he had called upon all the demonic powers to his aid; and since he had now won everything in her, he wished to unite her in the bonds of marriage with the prince of the demons, so that she might find herself united with him and one another in him, with all the greater security, indissolubly. She, who had already previously acknowledged the principle that the spiritual fathers had the right to dispose over their spiritual daughters, also took a liking to this proposal. This was now concluded and carried out in this assembly. She was baptized with sulfur, salt, and urine; she now renounced, from her whole heart, from all her powers, and from her entire soul, her God and her faith, and signed the renunciation with the blood from the little finger of her right hand, which he had incised. Six or seven written vows followed this first one, to draw the already tied knot even tighter. She was then marked on her head, on her heart, and on various other places; and now all those present danced around her jubilantly, and in general acclamation they proclaimed the newly received one as the princess of the Sabbath; which she from then on regularly attended in this capacity. Goffredy himself had already belonged to it since his pact; they had appointed him there as prince of the synagogues of France, Spain, England, Teutschland, Turkey, thus of Europe and a part of Asia; and as such he had visited the Sabbaths of all these countries and presided over them.\n\nHer master thereupon gave her the demon Asmodeus as her attendant, so that he might serve her, guard her for him, and preserve and increase in her the love for him. Things had thus proceeded for a time when the bizarre thought came to her: to enter the convent of the holy Ursula, which flourished under the care of the priests of the Christian Doctrine. Goffredy opposed this plan with the utmost vigor; but since he could not become master over it, he threatened to unleash the powers of hell against the convent. She remained three years with the Ursulines in considerable calm, only that on Wednesdays and Fridays, the critical days when the Sabbath was held, a black melancholy would take possession of her, which made her unbearable to herself and to all the world. She is now, after her reception, possessed by five demons, and beside her Louise Cappel by three; and the otherwise so peaceful convent becomes full of the noise and contortions of the possessed, so that terror and horror seize the superiors.\n\nHere too it is visibly apparent: that a somnambulistic predisposition lay at the foundation, which a bad priest had turned toward the demonic, and finally heightened to possession. The means he first employed was the breath, that aura in which so many natural connections are forged; in the ecclesiastical so often the conductor of the spirit from above and of his gifts, therefore also in the anti-ecclesiastical of the spirit from below and of his curse. The melancholy in early youth marks the first stage of the evil. This is heightened with persistently maintained sensuality, until the demonic witches' sleep with the entire scenery of the Sabbath has developed itself, and the second stage is now fully formed. Now the incipient partial possession emerges, and with it the third stage, where Asmodeus has taken possession of those organs to which the actions of sensuality are also directed. Finally the fourth stage has begun, when, in an impulse of return, those earlier melancholic attacks, still chained to the Sabbath time, have likewise r"}, "The Invention of the Olla Podrida Demonic Potion": {"start_char": 655201, "end_char": 657028, "pages": "199-200", "keywords": ["aversion to pastor in demonic possession", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "Such binding means are now the maleficia of a twofold kind: such as aim merely at temptation, and others that bind more closely in possession.

Through the more recent times the evil has propagated itself, and the magic books are full of praise for their efficacy.\n\nLike the sacraments of the Church, a material enters into their composition, mostly of obscene kind and bordering on putrefaction and decay. As form, the holy then unites itself with that which thus in abhorrence outrages nature; and thus one of the sacramentals in the lower degrees, higher up a sacrament, in the deepest sense the Eucharist; and the gray or black powder that has now arisen is sprinkled about, or taken in food, and now does its never-failing work.

Then a frightful condition came over her, from which only the laying on of a scapular freed her. Soon there followed such a heaviness in all her limbs that she could no longer hold herself on her feet, and, lying on the bed, could not move any of her leaden-heavy limbs; so that for seven to eight days she could scarcely take any food to herself. Then again, since all the doctors' remedies proved ineffective, violent convulsions followed. In this state one heard her call out with the accent of an enraptured soul: Let me regain my strength before the most holy Sacrament! The sisters resolved, upon her repeated cry, to carry the sick one into the choir; but when they tried to take the suppliant into their arms, none was able to lift her alone; only the strongest among them could at last, with unspeakable effort, bring her to the place. As soon as she had arrived at the door of the choir, there came, like a shining cloud from the tabernacle, which enveloped her and drove out the spirits. The cloud not only restored strength to her body, but made it so agile that she was sometimes carried from the choir door, at other times even from the cloister gate, as far as the altar railing. A wonderful peace descended upon her, and she, who through her illness had also lost the use of her sight, yet saw the object of her longing when it was exposed.\n\nOnce the efficacy of the remedy was known, they brought her from time to time into the choir and let her remain there for 3--4 hours; when she then returned to the sickroom, all her sufferings immediately returned. The doctors attributed her ills to a congestion of evil humors in the brain, and applied cupping to her head against it; she endured everything with the greatest resignation, although she well recognized the uselessness of the procedure. They then wanted to provide an outlet for the fluids between the skull and the brain membrane through trepanation. It was done, but no fluid nor vapor could be seen: everything was perfectly sound and healthy. This determined the superior, a wise and virtuous woman, to make a trial with obedience. In the convent was preserved the little cloak of the saintly Cardinal de B\u00e9rulle; this she laid upon her with the words: My sister, be healthy out of obedience to our most revered father! Immediately her convulsions ceased, which upon its return happened several times with the same success. At last the superior spoke the words: Be completely healthy in obedience, without convulsions, ravings, and blindness, and eat unhindered like the others. Immediately she was freed from all her ills, and henceforth ate without discomfort, as the doctors attested with official "}, "The Discovery of Hidden Magical Talismans in Louviers Convent": {"start_char": 663798, "end_char": 673186, "pages": "201-204", "keywords": ["debaucheries in louviers convent"], "verbatim": " and the abhorrence and the putrefaction, the frothing of sin.\n\nVery instructive and significant is what occurred in the convent of Louviers regarding such things. As a result of the errors and confusions there, many nuns had become possessed; they were exorcised, and from the statements of their spirits it emerged that Picard had applied six different kinds of magic within the convent. One was composed to keep the nuns in constant discord; another, to awaken in their hearts a disordered inclination toward Picard and la Bavent; the third, to shake their chastity; the fourth, to awaken in them an inner aversion to faith, hope, and love, and to provoke blasphemies against God in them; the fifth, to arouse in them a desire for the Sabbath and all magic; the sixth, to produce in them a contempt and abhorrence toward all sacraments. They now continued the exorcisms to compel them to indicate the places where they were hidden, and to bring them to light. \\[Page 202\\]\n\nThe sorely pressed ones at last found themselves compelled to obey; and a great multitude of persons drawn together were eyewitnesses as they were truly found in their hiding places, and authentic verbal protocols were drawn up concerning it. On 14 June 1643, in accordance with the declaration of the spirit in Sister Maria of the Holy Sacrament, who called himself Putiphar, in the evening between 7 and 8 in her chamber, from a wooden paneling of the walls that had never seemed to be opened, the first was drawn forth. The second, the last among those enumerated above, was found on the 30th of July under the high altar six feet deep under the earth. On the 19th in the evening at half eleven a third in the sacristy, from the same depth; and on the 24th of August at half twelve in the cloister between the four doors a fourth. On the 8th of September at eight o'clock in the evening another followed, nine feet deep under the pillar of the new building, brought to light in the presence of the Archbishop of Toulouse. Again two others on the epistle and gospel sides of the altar, from a depth of 6 to 8 feet; and yet a tenth on the 1st of December between 1 and 2 after midnight, in the interior of the choir, near the door; from a place that had more than twelve feet of depth. An eleventh and a twelfth then came still on the 22nd of January, and were drawn to the light from a depth of more than 7 feet, directly under the image of the Holy Virgin in her chapel,\n\nThe possessed now spoke with wonder, concerning all these magic instruments, those who had indicated their place even before they were found, circumstantially of their composition, of the inscriptions under which they had been fabricated on the Sabbath; they gave all their components, the ligatures and knots applied to them, the letters with which they were marked, and all other circumstances, without ever erring in the smallest detail. Before one began to dig, they designated some spot on the floor, and indicated: directly perpendicular beneath it, in a depth of 6 to 7, 8 to 9 up to 12 feet, the magic lay. One proceeded accordingly in digging, and always found it at the spot indicated by the exorcism. They stated: some were marked with the letters M. P. and M. B., the names of Picard and of Bavent; they testified that at a certain place lay the testament of David and Picard written in the Arabic language of the Sabbath; and everything was found exactly at the place they had indicated. No one could read and understand the writing; but the two nuns who had attested their presence read it one after the other, word for word, and explained it in agreement with each other. \\[Page 203\\]\n\nIn all these things deception lay very near, and it is obvious that all these results are utterly worthless, if one did not employ all prudence to exclude the possibility of fraud. Let us see how it was handled in this regard. The next suspicion that had to arise was naturally: that the possessed, who descended into the pit to bring the hidden thing to light, had themselves carried it down with them. The appeal to their simplicity, education, and conscientiousness could here give no sure guarantee; because all that became invalid in the paroxysm. Therefore, before they descended into the pit, for greater security, they were most strictly searched by other sensible, prudent nuns of good judgment, and moreover unmolested by the spirits. With them other thoughtful persons, clerics and doctors, descended into the trench, who kept them sharply under watch, and never permitted them to come near the place where the amulets were hidden. One was accustomed to give the searchers a pole with a hook into their hand; and all had to remain at a distance from the spot as far as the pole reached, and to bring the magic to light from there with the point of the hook.\n\nMore than that, the edge of the trench was lined with other people who paid very close attention to the hands and all the movements of the possessed woman, and who would not easily have missed any practiced deception. It was advantageous that the time of discovery always fell at night; for now many torches were lit, which, properly distributed, mutually dispelled all shadows on the walls of the pit; so that everything stood in full light, which would not have been achievable by day. The Bishop of Embrun, who was present everywhere, moreover had the Most Blessed Sacrament held over the heads of the exorcised possessed woman in the pit at the decisive moment; in order to strike down any deceit also through the terrors of sacrilege. Despite all this caution, the result was always the same: the possessed woman dug up the earth at the indicated spot with her lance; the paper in which the charm was wrapped then became visible in its whiteness through a kind of glow; but it immediately clouded when touched by the air, and became dirty, moldy, and unsightly. But the possessed woman, in the instant when she perceived the hidden thing, was cast backward as if struck by a thunderbolt, uttered a terrible scream, and the spirits howled and roared out of her like wolves and tigers. \\[Page 204\\]\n\nSince all these precautionary measures that had been taken still did not fully dispel every doubt, as long as the nuns descended into the pit; the method of procedure was also changed in this respect when searching for the last three talismans. The one buried under the choir door was exhumed on 15 December 1645, and two others in the Loreto chapel on 3 January; so that the possessed woman, kept far from the edge of the trench, indicated the spot from outside with a 15-foot-long pole, where the buried item was then found, without the finder ever approaching it. The last one was likewise indicated by the possessed woman from outside the trench, with her face turned away; as she thrust the pole into the earth at one spot, and then ordered them to dig further. From time to time she then called out: One moment more! At last she made a violent thrust, always with her face turned away; and immediately the little package came to light, two finger-breadths from the tip of her pole. Skepticism now had to yield to the evidence of the facts, and the commissioners, sent on behalf of the queen and the council of state, with the Archbishop of Toulouse at their head, issued an authentic testimony as to with what caution and deliberation the proceedings had been conducted in their presence; how they had placed the searching nun between them, and how the paper, white and intact at the first finding, had become moldy, dissolved, and dirty under their eyes.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this praiseworthy caution, deceptions may have slipped in among them; not exactly such as were consciously devised and carried out by the girls, but begun in the paroxysm under the impulsion of the power possessing them, and completed with the skill that then entered in. The voices called out from the possessed women several times during the whole search: I will play a trick on you! I assure you, you are being fooled! In the case of one who had thus called out, the outcome seemed indeed to confirm the warning. She had indicated a spot with her 12-foot rod; they searched and could find nothing. They therefore emptied a portion of the earth at the bishop's feet to examine it; the bishop held the hands of the possessed woman in his own. She claimed that the sought-after item was in this earth, and threw herself upon it; now, after she had searched for some time, some of those present saw the charm under the little fingers of her hands, and thought that she had rather trickily carried it into the pile.\n\nOne sees truth and lies border in these realms so closely upon one another that they falsify and mingle with each other mutually, and a hair-sharp separation of the two becomes nearly impossible. What, however, emerges in all these attempts is a result that, given all that has gone before, can by no means surprise us. As natural stimulants pass unnoticed over life tuned to the middle average temperature, but touch the more tender resonating part most strongly; so too will it be arranged in like manner with the stimulants of a higher kind, and their relation to the higher spirituality. As the rhabdomancer thus feels out the metals and salts in the bosom of the earth; so too does the possessed one harbor the same excitability for the magic stimulants to w"}, "The Spiritual Possessions in the Convent of Louviers": {"start_char": 673345, "end_char": 705321, "pages": "205-216", "keywords": ["- possession in quercy convent 1491"], "verbatim": "\nThe curse that rests upon the head of the favored ones in the nocturnal regions acts like the rigid, staring gaze of the serpent upon the mobile nature of the birds; fettering, bewitching, banishing, and then drawing into itself. It thus forms a whirl around itself, and whoever falls into this whirlpool is driven about and swallowed down like the ship in the maw of the sea; whereby those artificial magic stimulants act subsidiarily, like magnets, to strengthen and heighten the pull. The consequence of being bound in this magic circle is now the state of obsession, in which the tightly held grasp of the relations binds all the entangled ones into a real community of fellowship. This state usually leads in gradually through a whole series of visions, apparitions, and ghostly occurrences, in many intermediate stages; which, increasing gradually, finally bring about the height of the enchantment. This gradual increase was quite strikingly noticeable in the convent of Louviers. It began with the Sister Barbe de St.\u00a0Michael beholding, several times at night, in her cell a great number of lights kindled, and soon she herself could not take three steps without her knee being violently struck against the ground, until at last she fell to the earth.\n\nWhen she and some others, who afterward came into the same state with her, went to Communion; then they saw the grating toward the church illuminated with torches, but pursued by all sorts of phantoms, which, after frightening them greatly, flew off through the chimney. At the same time one saw bowls and pots falling in the kitchen without anyone touching them. To Sister Maria de St.\u00a0Nicolas came a phantom in the form of Picard, at about the time of sunrise, sat upon her bed, and spoke to her; while at another time, amid great noise, all sorts of utensils were overturned around her. Upon the Sister of St.\u00a0Laurent it came from the heel, and made her fall often; but soon it climbed up to the head, so that henceforth severe headache alternated with the ailment in the foot. Still more strongly was Sister Anna de la Nativit\u00e9 disturbed. She saw a phantom in terrible forms that stood motionless before her the whole night in her cell; if she went anywhere, it hurried ahead of her; in the choir it performed all sorts of juggling tricks before her to amuse her; and threatened her fiercely when she discovered the matter to the superior, who advised her to treat all the spook with contempt. At the time when she performed any act of humility and renunciation, the form fled; but upon returning, made what had happened ridiculous. During Mass it gaped its maw against the assembled, and threatened to devour them; set naked people before her, and sometimes struck them hard as well. Once during the Preface there appeared to her a crucifix, from which a voice declared itself to be her husband, promised her his protection, freed an arm to embrace her, and recommended to her only to keep their relationship secret. \\[Page 206\\]\n\nSince she did not answer at all, the apparition finally vanished amid great noise. Against these temptations she held a nine-day prayer before the Holy Virgin. Then an exceedingly bright-shining sun appeared before her, and the voice brought forth the same language from her, gave her sweet words of love, and urged her to union with the eternal light. Since she did not consent, the voice first fell silent; then later the glow also went out, when she made the sign of the cross against the illusion. The apparition soon returned in the form of other sisters and the superior; during the fast she saw meat dishes in abundance, smelled the odor of flesh everywhere, and men were there who urged her to seize them. Then followed violent convulsions and rigidities that pressed her hard; and the superior found her several times lying on the ground, stiff as wood.\n\nDuring a service in the choir, her breviary was thrown from her four or five times without her moving her arm, and during the prayer she herself was thrust forward. When she once came out of herself, her sandals were tied without her moving; her rule was torn from her sleeve and thrown away, sometimes all the way over the altar; and the same happened with her rosary. Another time, in the presence of the superior, this rule was hurled into the middle of the fire; the superior quickly pulled it out again, and found it not damaged, although it had lain in the flames long enough. Another time, her relics were torn from her neck; the superior fastened them with three knots in the name of the Trinity, and the confessor forbade them to be torn away any further. It did not happen anymore; but from then on she was more often strangled at the girdle. When she sang with the others in the choir, she was often lifted a cubit high; and when others, to prevent this, placed their feet on hers, they felt these themselves lifted. Finally the spirit came in the form of the Holy Virgin, confirming all earlier apparitions as if they had come from her Son, and repeatedly demanding silence from her. \\[Page 207\\]\n\nShe had to overcome some reluctance, also to disclose this to her superiors; and on account of her fear, two sisters were assigned to her at night with a burning lamp. But the lights were repeatedly blown out, the utensils thrown into disorder, and the beds shaken for so long until the light was relit. With Sister Maria of the Holy Spirit it was done in the same way, the same noise and throwing and falling surrounded her; three nights in a row circles were made before her, and she heard the words: When we are finished, then we have you at the right point! When she knelt at Christmas before the exposed Sacrament, reflected on her life, and offered herself to the Lord, suddenly a horror in the spirit came over her; blasphemous ideas rose up in her, and she no longer dared to look up at the Sacrament; for she saw there things that the human mind cannot bear. In the following night she felt a heaviness that laid itself three times upon her head; then she lost her senses, and could neither speak nor move herself. Thereupon two phantoms appeared to her, one large, which seated itself in a chair; the other dwarfish, only a cubit high, which settled on her stomach; both spoke with each other as if the whole convent, and she herself also, belonged to them. Meanwhile she lay under her alp unconscious, and could not bring forth her usual saying: Et verbum caro factum est! although the two constantly mocked her to do so. But what was most remarkable of all on this occasion was what happened with Sister Maria of the Holy Sacrament, and what she herself recorded. The event began with that touch at the pit of the heart, which her Picard, as we have mentioned earlier, had made.\n\nWhen I had gone to bed in the evening after nine o'clock, she recounts, three strong fire sparks fell from the ceiling onto the bedcover, such that I had great fear on account of it. When I once imposed the discipline upon myself, the scourge was snatched from my hand and thrown into my face; a light was blown out for me in the attic, and I was seized by the girdle and thrown down the stairs. Another time a heavy mass was laid upon my shoulders, such that I thought I would suffocate; when I dragged myself with difficulty to the worthy Mother, I felt how the mass tumbled down onto a step of the stairs with a great crash; but I was thrown down at the same time, such that blood gushed forth from my mouth and nose. I was to ask fearlessly, if it returned: Who are you, what do you want here, and why do you turn to me?\n\nWhen therefore I again one night around 11 o'clock heard a confused noise, I spoke the words. A terrible voice said: My sister, I have a secret to entrust to you! I cried out in horror; people came running, and still heard the sound of a blow that I received. The following night the spirit came in the form of a deceased convent sister, begging for certain prayers for the comfort of her soul, which however the confessor forbade in the prescribed form, allowing me some other devotional exercises. After some days a voice came, as if from a flash of lightning, thanking me for what I had done; I took it for the voice of the soul that I had freed, and formed a good opinion of myself. \\[Page 208\\]\n\nSeveral apparitions in various forms followed, some very frightful; and I was plagued in every way. Once my signature was tricked from me for a paper that was supposed to be a creed; in truth however, as it was later read to me, it contained all imaginable blasphemies. Again it came to me in the form of a convent sister who was my friend, who now brought me roses and carnations; then again struck, bit, and scratched me. One night I saw a young, naked man standing before me; I made the sign of the cross against it, and sprinkled holy water; but the form only mocked me. I, holding it for a ghost, then went toward it; but when I noticed that it did not vanish, I cried out with all my strength. The worthy Mother came running, asked what was the matter with me; but I only kept crying, holding fast to the form, which dragged me to the chimney, and in doing so lifted me two feet high. I feared being dragged out of the convent thereby, let go on that account, and now fell to the ground; where they found me, my hands full of black, reddish-glinting, stinking ointment.\n\nThey cleansed me of the filth, and then threw the cloth into the fire. The confessor now ordered that one of the older sisters go to me from time to time, to see how I was each time. But if this one omitted it once, then the demon came in her form, flattered itself into my trust; and as I gradually placed some faith in the deceiving words, and confided my perplexity amid the many apparitions to the seeming figure, this one advised me: no longer to entrust myself to people, nor to appear before my superiors, confessor, and directors; God would lead me by his own ways, to him alone must I turn my whole trust. In later meetings the form then let itself be drawn into various teachings, which amounted to this: all flesh is like hay; the Lord had therefore taken it upon himself, not to honor it, but to make it contemptible to us through the assumption of so many mistreatments. For that reason he had also reproved his apostles that through too great attachment to his humanity they had become unreceptive to the spirit.\n\nFor his true worshippers worship God in spirit and in truth; only the carnal ones have made the body into a sacrament for themselves, which they now adore; whereas the divine Majesty abhors flesh and blood. She then declared herself with equal definiteness against another life; hell is an invention of men, who knew no other way to maintain order here below. The true hell is rather on earth in the midst of men, and there also paradise is to be found; it is therefore a great folly to give up a present good for a fantastical hope that will never be fulfilled; for the soul must die with the body, otherwise God would have spoken untruth when he said: Thou shalt surely die. \\[Page 209\\]\n\nI became wholly confused, and at last told it to my confessor; and now the apparition sought, in my opinion, to ruin this one too, by appearing one morning in his form in my cell, and making me a formal declaration of love. Amidst my horror at this, doubts yet arose in me again, and I drove him away with the sign of the cross. The apparition came likewise another time in his form to the speaking grille, until the arrival of the real one drove it away. The spirit then made me believe that the confessor handed me a magic potion in the host of the sacrament every time; as a sign of this I should pay attention, and I would find it marked red every time. I now looked more closely indeed, and beheld on it as he had told me. Another time the hosts appeared to me half-blackened, and only the firm conviction of the confessor's spotless virtue could destroy this illusion for me.\n\nNow the matter took another turn. One day in the early morning, a glow like that of a summer dawn illuminated my cell; and a beautiful youth of fifteen or sixteen years appeared to me in it, who greeted me graciously, saying: he was sent to me for my protection, because I had found grace before God, who had been pleased with what I had done hitherto. But he wanted now to lead me further on his ways, and had sent him to me for that purpose. For this, it was first of all necessary that I trust in him alone; for men, since their fall, have taken ignorance, mortality, and bestiality into themselves, and now one blind man would lead another. Silence and secrecy is therefore the first thing he demands of thee; for thou canst not serve two masters, and where God's Majesty is active, the reason of man must stand aside. Say therefore, like the mother of the Savior: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word! and henceforth ask no more at the high priest of the law.\n\nThe conversation lasted three hours; I had weighed everything carefully, and found nothing suspicious; he truly seemed to me to be my guardian angel, and I thanked God in full joy, for that day I felt no temptation. On the following day his discourse turned to the predestination of God; how he chooses his brides, and leads them on unusual paths, and allows them not the smallest thought of infidelity, which I therefore must combat even as it arises. Then for three days in succession it was spoken of the essence of God, and of the nature of men, who were created in the image of the angels---who themselves are images of God---but have defiled this image, and now wrongly call themselves fathers, masters, and doctors, and true Christians; whereas God, as Christ has said, should alone be called Father. In the sixth conference it was set forth how God created the angels from his essence, who, being of like nature with him, are also bound in perfect union with his substance. The two conferences next following spread themselves over the diversity of opinions and the disunity among men; for which God therefore sent his own Son, to bring them back to obedience. \\[Page 210\\]\n\nGabriel was there the bringer of the commandments of the Most High, and since he found her willing, he entered into her, and incarnated himself in her body; therefore he is the one whom men call the Redeemer of the world. I too should arm myself with prayer to receive the approaching Bridegroom. At the now following return, he asked me: whether I was now resolved to serve God in utmost perfection and renunciation. I replied: how I had therefore left the world to serve God; body and soul stood without reservation at his service. He praised me for it, and I felt such comfort and longing to be pleasing to God that I could scarcely bear it. He said now: Permit me to touch your heart, to strengthen it, and to fix it in this love.\n\nAt these words a kind of fear came over me, and I laid my hands on my breast: Know that before my confessor I have made a resolution to permit no one, whoever it may be, any touching! He said: he had done it only for my testing; but I replied: If it is God's will, then do it, otherwise I can never will it! I saw his countenance change, he seemed angry, yet without his splendor being diminished. He touched me, and said: that I was wrong to doubt him. For the tenth time he came shining brighter than ever before, to cleanse me, as he said, from my imperfections. He touched my heart, but in all chastity, and no evil thought arose in me, only a longing to love God; and I truly held him to be my good angel.\n\nAt his eleventh visit he asked me what I had, because I showed some unrest; I confessed to him at last that I had been in temptation the whole day to disclose the matter to my confessor. He reproved me for it, and said: Give me your tongue, that I may touch it and strengthen it. I could not help telling him: that all these touchings of his highly displeased me; because they seemed to me unsuitable for a spirit. He replied: You must mortify your own judgment even more strongly, for you will only your own will, and not that of the Lord! So do then, I replied, what pleases God's Majesty; he touched, however, only after a long speech on submission to God's will, my tongue. In the morning he came earlier than usual, in the full splendor of his beauty, and spoke so movingly of the glory of the blessed that my heart was ravished; and he, after touching my heart and eyes, had to keep his hand on the former to give me strength. They found me as if out of my senses, the whole day I could scarcely hold myself; and since I reproached myself for it: as if I sought only my own comfort in the All, and therefore grasped the nettles, and gave myself a hard discipline; he fully approved at evening what I had done. \\[Page 211\\]\n\nHe returned in the morning, an exceedingly beautiful rose in his hand, which he offered me. But I covered my face, beseeching him: that he might moderate his all too great splendor, because I could not bear it. He touched my eyes and heart, I took the rose and kissed it; but he spoke to me of the immortality of the soul, and how only one man had been immortal, because without sin; since sin makes the spirit mortal, as the body is. I rejoiced over all these speeches, and my better knowledge before other men, and attributed it to my unceasing zeal to serve God. In the evening I had withdrawn to my cell, and prayed to God: that he, if the form was my good angel, might let it appear to me now for my comfort; but not permit that I be deceitfully led astray. He was immediately present, and after some exchanges of words I said to him: O you who are so good, and will the peace of souls, disclose yet to my confessor or to one of my superiors the relation that exists between us, so that I may find full peace!\n\nHe replied: the most beautiful gift that he could bestow upon me was my complete seclusion from all fellowship with men. In doing so, he touched my heart: \"See,\" he said, \"this is the seat of the passions; but you feel none at the touch, for I purify and sanctify all that approaches me in simplicity and faithfulness of heart.\" In the fourteenth meeting, he spoke to me of God and the fall of the angels, which had occurred only because, through lack of steadfastness and trust in their will, they had moved unstably; and thereby stepped out of their union with God, the highest bliss, to which they, as intelligences whom God had not called forth from nothing but from his own essence, had been predestined. All this was said so beautifully and compellingly that I cannot reproduce it, yet some apprehension always lingered in the background for me; so that when he demanded a pledge of fidelity from me, I always replied: \"If God so wills!\" or: \"I have placed God in full possession of my heart!\"\n\nThe next day, after Communion, a great dryness had come over me, and I complained of it to him. He said: he had imposed it upon me for my testing, and to draw me away from all earthly things; and then he asked me three times in succession, with a sweet voice: \"My daughter! my beloved! do you love me?\" Each time I lost the use of my senses; he had to bring me back to myself by touching me, and then he vanished with the words: \"Three more days, and you shall be forever established in my grace.\" After the next Communion, the same sadness and aridity returned, and I withdrew quickly into my cell. My spirit soon visited me again and reproached me for my weakness in bearing my trial; nothing on this earth is won without effort. Finally, on the last day, when he came and inquired about the state of my inner self, I said to him: nothing troubles me at present, for I have come to full resignation in God's will; although, whatever I may undertake, I cannot master a certain fear of possible deception. Yet I promise, if nothing contrary to God arises in me, deep silence. He approved of all this, and spoke to me ravishingly of the joys that awaited me. \\[Page 212\\]\n\nIn the evening, the confessor had me summoned to the speaking grille; I went with reluctance. When I appeared, he asked me: how things stood with me, and what was passing within me? I answered: things stood well, and only good passed within me! He, in turn: \"So something is indeed passing in you, and I want to know what it is!\" \"Jesus! my father,\" I said, \"if something were passing between God and me, I would be bound to disclose it! For the left hand should know nothing of the good that the right hand does.\" He now commanded me, upon holy obedience, to tell him what I wished to conceal; and I said: nothing except that I had come to a full indifference toward all creatures. He found this well done, but warned me to be on my guard; lest under the pretext of the good I be led into evil. \"But,\" I said, \"my father! is there something in my behavior that perhaps arouses suspicion?\" \"I have no suspicion,\" was the reply, \"but rather fear of deception; your fainting spells after holy Communion, the sadness on your face, your silence about the state of your conscience for fifteen days or three weeks, make me believe that something is the matter with you.\" \"Truly!\" I replied, \"for some time now I have been withdrawing from men, because true consolation is only with God; from men, however, only hindrance comes.\" \"Well!\" he said, \"I believe you, my daughter, and I pray to God that he may let you recognize the truth, so that you may not be deceived, and that all may end to his glory!\"\n\nI looked at him without saying a word, for I did not know what I should do; but I thought to myself: this is a temptation, for I have today pledged fidelity and silence. He, noticing my uncertainty, said: I see well that you do have something to share with me after all! No, I replied, I am only pondering the words I have heard, and at the same time I rose to leave. When I was in the middle of the parlor, I stopped to consider what I should do. He called me back: My daughter! I beg you, tell me the truth---that was his address; do you perhaps have some fear? I fear no one but God, was my answer. Then go on your way, I believe you! When I was near the door, I turned toward him and said: Farewell, my father! He in turn: Farewell, my daughter! I kept looking at him, and said once more: Farewell, my father! I am going now. He called me back yet again: My daughter! one more little word; come closer, I will tell it to you softly. I approached the speaking grille, and he gently took hold of the cord with which I was girded, and said to me: I see clearly that you have something to share with me; I will not let you go now until you have spoken the word to me, even if I should not depart from here until tomorrow! \\[Page 213\\]\n\nI was greatly astonished, and said: It is true, my father! something extraordinary is taking place between me and my good angel. God imparts many graces to me through him; but I cannot speak of all this, because I have pledged fidelity and silence, and I fear otherwise to lose the consolation of his visits. The confessor replied to these words: In truth, my daughter! this angel is the devil himself! An immense trembling seized my whole body, my teeth chattered against each other so that I could not speak. The confessor spoke prayers and exorcisms over me, and in the end had to summon the worthy mother to my assistance. The trembling lasted perhaps half an hour; when it had passed, the father wanted me to abjure all the words of agreement and affection that I might have spoken. I replied: as I renounce everything that I might have said contrary to God's will. But he would not be satisfied with that; I was to renounce the angel entirely and regard him as a devil; I, however, refused to proceed further that day, saying that one must first see what the matter truly was. I promised him in this that I would faithfully report the further outcome. He handed me over to the sister with the charge: not to leave me until she had brought me to bed.\n\nI, when I was alone, spoke words of courage to myself, and when all in the convent had become quiet, he came in his clarity; but with an expression of such raging anger as if he wished to destroy me. He reproached me as unfaithful, ungrateful, wretched; I knew not what misfortune awaited me; only repentance and a solemn vow of greater fidelity for the future could save me. He looked at me with a piercing, loving gaze: Promise me, he cried, only better fidelity for the future, and I will forgive your weakness! I felt a great tenderness toward him, but at the same time a fear of giving my consent, and without answering, I turned to the other side. But he immediately turned me back, and said: What is this, my daughter? How changed you are! Do you not wish me to take possession of your heart? I replied: This heart belongs to God alone; I do not regret what I did earlier in the confessional. If you are from God, then it will also be pleasing to you; but if you wish to remove all suspicion from me, appear before the confessor at the speaking grille in your full clarity, and reveal to him what you have undertaken for my guidance. If he approves everything and declares you to be an angel of God, then I promise you unwavering fidelity; if not, then leave off from me, unworthy as I am. \\[Page 214\\]\n\nWith every word that I spoke, the expression on his face changed; at last he became furious, and losing all composure, he said: Wretch! Is this the fulfillment of your promise from yesterday? What have you noticed in me since then that is hateful to God? I see, I have shown you too much love, you have turned the medicine into poison; once more, do not force me, after so much mildness, to turn to severity against you! I was so moved that it was a close thing---I would have agreed. But I said: Even if I promise you fidelity, I cannot keep it; the confessor will question me, and for all the world I will not deceive him. Give me only your heart, he said, and I will manage it somehow. My heart belongs to God, I cried out; I renounce you, wretched deceiver! Now I see, you are not from God, and I despise your flattering words and threats. Ha, unhappy one! With this word I deliver you to your enemy, as punishment for you! With that he vanished. That was on April 4, 1642; splendor and glory were gone, and from then on he returned to her armed only with all terrors.\n\nN\u00e4chtliche cross and zigzag wanderings, one will say, of a nun dancing about in the garden of love, who by day, through cloister and rule, saw herself excluded from entering the enchanted gardens, and now in the silence of the night recovered from her harm. The confessor was the lord and master of the waking world that surrounded her; and in her prose, her asceticism, her penances and her constraints he kept her enclosed. But when she had sunk into the arms of sleep in her solitary cell, then the poetess awoke within her; the alleged angel was the lord of the new dream world; he touched her creative imagination with a glowing finger, and this then gave birth to the extravagant images in which she reveled, entirely forgetting the troubles of waking states. But soon a strife arose between the two realms, for the master of prose and the master of poetry could not in the long run get along under one roof. The mother of the nun had cried out, at that time when the goddess-mother Isis had tried to burn out the daughter, purifying her in her flames.\n\nThe master of prose was crude; by her girdle he drew the reluctant one down into his phlegm. In the sinking down, her inner being was transformed; the genius of gentle beauty turned for her, in frightful fashion, into a terrible demon; the idyllic drama, since the tragic element had veered into the comic, was translated into a baroque parody of itself---that is, she became possessed as punishment for her fall; with a different outcome, the monk would have become a Philistine, just as the peasants who had blasphemed Latona were transformed into frogs. --- \\[Page 215\\]\n\nAll this sounds round and witty; but it fits only poorly with the dubious barter between the two regions. This alleged dream world finds itself, below and to the side, built around and framed by the waking world; and of the arabesques that traverse it, a part does indeed take root, in its plant-like half, in sobriety, and only the winged spirits in the flower calyces grow over into the enclosed realm. For just as the strong, encroaching color in the eye awakens its complementary color; so one may assume that the imagination complements the prose of life with poetry awakened from within, in contrast. But these poetic dreams and foams have at other times entered very tangibly into life; and one cannot deny that the plant-like then took root in the dream world, but the marvelous, which had blossomed above, was carried out into the waking world. When the possessions broke out in the cloister, and the Bishop of Evreux Picard, proceeding thither in a six-horse carriage; the possessed nuns came, who knew how to run swiftly like the wind over the roofs and the walls, and who walked over the waters without sinking, nimbly towards him, threw themselves between the horses, and it succeeded for them more than once to halt the carriage.\n\nWas that perhaps also a dream which the horses had dreamed? When in the choir the breviaries and order rules of the tormented flew about, desks and utensils were overturned at their approach; when their sandals hung on their veils; when at dead of night a murmur of many voices arose around them; when the dreaming Marie herself was thrown down the stairs: were all these wondrous things perhaps dreams that had escaped from the dream-world into the waking world? When the same Marie once, in the presence of witnesses, ran with impetuosity up a mulberry tree to its outermost tender summit branches, and now from branch to branch circled and flew around the tree like a bird; did the tree that had borne this wondrous fruit stand in the open cloister garden, or in the nun's cell behind the dream portal? Thus the truth that has fallen from waking into the alleged world of illusion stands opposed by another, which has stepped forth from this world of illusion into the real; each of the two thus has a root of truth within itself, and they are therefore placed on equal footing with one another. \\[Page 216\\]\n\nThis equal validity of both spheres, and the complete parallelism in their effects, utterly inexplicable under the presupposition that the one is merely the negation of the other; explains itself readily if one lays beneath them a double ground of truth, an inner and an outer. Then arises a state which takes its first origin from certain mediating personalities, here that of Picard. Its genesis, and the gradual development of the symptoms in both directions, we have seen pass before us in what has gone before. If on this path it has reached its height, then it ends at last in that possession which calls forth voices from the inner realm, named the spiritual obsession. Sixteen or eighteen nuns of the convent were in this state. They were, shaken by the most violent convulsions, rolled into balls, twisted in the strangest contortions; but the doctors were astonished to find them, amid all this, in perfect health, and after three to four hours of paroxysms of the most violent kind their pulse was mostly unmoved and calm. They declared unanimously: it is impossible to explain such violent, prolonged, frequently recurring attacks, which leave no trace after their passing, by mere natural forces. For four to five years the thus affected ones were tormented day and night; for two years during the exorcisms they were for many hours at a stretch in raging, howling, screaming, and convulsions; moreover they felt the movement of their spirits often, so that they were for 6--8 hours of the day in the most terrifying excitement: but when the attack or the exorcism ceased, and"}, "The Possessions in the Auxonne Convent": {"start_char": 729755, "end_char": 729755, "pages": "218-222", "keywords": ["- possession in quercy convent 1491"], "verbatim": ""}, "The Possessions in the Louviers Convent": {"start_char": 729755, "end_char": 729755, "pages": "224-228", "keywords": ["- possession in quercy convent 1491"], "verbatim": ""}, "The Dancing Possession Epidemic in Li\u00e8ge": {"start_char": 731351, "end_char": 731351, "pages": "228-230", "keywords": ["- tact in possession revelations"], "verbatim": ""}, "Basque Children Abducted to the Sabbath": {"start_char": 740986, "end_char": 741636, "pages": "232-233", "keywords": ["roasted child eaten at sabbath"], "verbatim": "Men and women, possessed by the demon, half-naked, with wreaths on their heads, went along; and, holding each other by the hands, they performed dances before the spectators on the streets, in the churches, and in the houses, without the least shame.

One easily comprehends that such states have great affinity with those of epidemic obsessions, and form the transitions between the being afflicted and the being attacked. First, such cases will present themselves where, although the suspicion may well have pointed to a personal center, nothing certain has been ascertained about it. Thus Mass\u00e4us says: In the year 1491, around the feast of Peter's Chair, the demons began to inhabit and possess the convent of the nuns of Quercy (Quercetensium), and to torment its inhabitants most cruelly for four years and four months. One saw them frequently running through the fields like dogs, flying in the air like birds, climbing trees in the manner of cats, hanging from the branches, imitating the voices of various animals, penetrating secrets, and prophesying future things. \\[Page 243\\]\n\nSo often Heinrich, Bishop of Cambrai, or Aegidius Nettetet, Dean of his church, both pious men, set out for exorcism, they knew it beforehand, and cried: The one with the horns is again on the way to threaten us. After all manner of means had been applied, which were sought out from everywhere, their names were brought to Rome and read out by Alexander VI on Maundy Thursday under the Mass; but without any effect. Johanna Potier, who was held to be the beginning of the evil, had been in confidential relations with the demon from her ninth year onward, and this one accused her in the convent: that she had gone to Communion 434 times unworthily; which statement, however, since he is a liar from the beginning, cannot be trusted. She was led to Cambrai and died in the dungeon on St.\u00a0Martin's Day; the others were freed in June after four years of possession. Joh. Molinet in his Belgian chronicle for the year 1490 confirms these accounts, adding: that the evil had passed from one to the other innocents. The demons had given themselves out as angels of light who belonged to the hierarchy of the Seraphim, and had at last been driven out by the Dean of Cambrai. He had carried the Eucharist to the sick, and set the demons the condition: if it were nothing but bread, then it might by no means disturb them in their possession; but if "}, "The Possessed Nuns of Kentorp": {"start_char": 786386, "end_char": 791225, "pages": "244-245", "keywords": ["- tests on possessed women"], "verbatim": "hey must withdraw from the possessed.\n\nWier, whose testimony as a physician and Protestant one may here allow to stand,\u00b9 even if he had the weakness of believing in the devil, has recorded several other cases of this kind from his own experience. In the convent of Kentorp, in the county of Mark not far from Hamm, the enclosed nuns, noblewomen as well as others, were seized by a possession; and the individuals in various ways, some more violently, others more mildly, tormented. In this variety, however, there was one thing common to all: that as soon as one was seized by an attack, all the others, even if they were in completely separate rooms, as soon as they heard the noise, were likewise drawn into it and miserably plagued. Anna Lemgon was one of the older and stout-hearted sisters who clearly explained to the physician Wier the circumstances of the whole evil. It began with her, who was one of the first seized, with pains in the left hypochondrium; she was held to be seized by epilepsy, and was sent to the convent of Nonnery so that she might drink from the skull of the holy Cornelius; she did so, and the nuns now falsely said that she was better. \\[Page 244\\]\n\nBut when she was soon more violently visited by the evil, and other nuns were likewise found drawn into it; a soothsayer was consulted, who gave testimony against the convent's cook as the originator of the evil. Now the malignancy of the plague increased; the convulsions became more manifold and more deeply cutting, and the seized were driven to bite one another, and so also other strangers, to strike and throw down; yet without further harm, since they seemed to themselves as light as feathers, and now noticed that they were not masters of themselves. If they were held back from striking or the other acts of violence, they were pressed in the heart; but if they were let loose again, they felt, even if they injured or bit themselves, no evil at all; so that it seemed as if it had become a necessity for them to rage against their own bodies. If Anna gave herself to prayer, she could by no means follow it with attention or move her tongue for it; but if she merely chattered off her hours thoughtlessly, then she was in no way hindered from it; it rather seemed to her as if she were thereby relieved and refreshed.\n\nShe could not think seriously about any good or evil matter; it seemed to her then as if she were stupid in spirit, without sense, without distinction, and without judgment. If a religious, God-consecrated man addressed her, she was as it were scolded by the devil on that account; but if she spoke with this one, or with another female person, about vain and trivial things, then she was wonderfully uplifted and exalted thereby. Although all were plagued in manifold ways, they were nevertheless all of good appetite, and the nourishment proceeded well. From here the malady now soon spread also to the nearby city of Hamm, afflicting not a few citizens of this city with various torments. When they were instructed by the pastor of the place in his room, and he had them recite the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer; they began to question one another, and the demons now named themselves with jesting names, as one said: he was called Flederwisch, another Flatfoot, the third Rosenbaum; but he who now wrought mischief in the monastery at Kentorp named himself Hornuar.\n\nAt last one asked: The pastor wants to drive us out; what shall we do now? The other replied: I will ride on a black buck to that woman whom he named; I shall be a dear guest to her. The other said: he would go with the same conveyance to a second one. Both, sitting backward on chairs like fools, now seemed, as gesture and voice indicated, to ride to the aforementioned places; without, however, having moved from the spot. A third, rolled and drawn together like a ball, rushed toward the closed door; and as this was suddenly opened, he fell down the stairs, but entirely unharmed. In the place Houel near Hamm, likewise many possessed persons came to light. Also in another neighboring city the inhabitants were seized by similar attacks and plagues, on account of which many investigations arose there against individuals. As in this case the manifestation of possession often hovers midway between malice and jest; so the contagion that produced it hovers between a moral and a physical one. \\[Page 245\\]\n\nThe cook Elsa of Camen was named to the nuns by the soothsayer as the originator of their ills; and she, or her mother and her brother, or the image of a black cat, appeared to them henceforth always during the attacks. She herself suffered from an epileptic malady, like the others; but now it was said that she had inflicted it upon herself, to divert suspicion from herself. When imprisoned, she at first confessed to "}, "The Demonic Plague in the Monastery of Werte": {"start_char": 791281, "end_char": 798291, "pages": "245-247", "keywords": ["- demonic temptation after exorcism", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": " than curses. Wondrous was the plague of a number of nuns in the monastery of Werte in the county of Horn. The beginning of it was traced there to a poor woman who, during Lent, had borrowed a quart, about three pounds of salt, from the monastery, and had returned the loan nearly double by Easter. Now white pellets were found in the dormitory, resembling sugar-coated seeds in appearance, but of salty taste; these, however, were not eaten, and no one knew how they had come there. Then something was heard sighing about there, like a sick person; voices were also sometimes heard inviting several of the virgins to rise and go with it to the fire, for it was sick. If they really got up to look after the sick sister, they found no one. If one of them wanted to relieve herself into the chamber pot, it was violently snatched from her, and the bed besmirched with what had been passed. Sometimes they were dragged out of bed a few steps, and tickled under the soles of their feet in such a way that they feared they must die from excessive laughter.\n\nSeveral pieces of flesh were torn out from some; but from many others, their legs, arms, and faces were twisted backward. Some of those thus tormented, although they had taken nothing for 59 days but turnip broth with bread, nevertheless vomited up a black substance like ink in great quantities; it was so sharp and bitter that it ate away the hands in their mouths. Some were lifted up above the heads of the people and thrown down again. Once, when the sick were calmed and therefore very cheerful, about thirteen friends visited the convent at the same time; the nuns were thrown senseless and speechless from the table, so that several lay there with twisted arms and legs as if dead. One was lifted up, and although those present laid hands to resist, she was nevertheless torn out above their heads and then dashed down again in such a way that she lay there as if dead. Afterward she came to herself as if from a deep sleep and walked about unharmed. Some walked supported on the ends of their leg bones, without making use of their feet, which they dragged after them as if entirely loosened from their ligaments. \\[Page 246\\]\n\nThey climbed the trees like cats and crept down them again without making any movement of the body. The worthy mother of the convent, while she was engaged in conversation with the noble and pious Margaretha, Countess of Bur, had a piece of flesh torn from her loins. She cried out in pain and was carried to bed; but the wound suppurated in part, and in part it was black; however, she was healed. Once, when two of the afflicted nuns were sitting together laughing and cheerful, and speaking with one another of a black cat that a matron of the town, whom they named, had sent locked in a basket into the dormitory; a third healthy one had secretly listened to their talk, and the prioress had examined the basket with her and two or three others, whereupon the cat then jumped away. For this reason the woman was accused of maleficium, and thrown into the dungeon with seven others. Although neighbors and the poor gave her testimony of such mercy toward the needy that she herself went hungry; she was put to the torture but could not be brought to confession by any torment. When the bailiff thereupon offered her food according to custom, she declared: she was too weak to eat, but begged for something to drink. When the drink was immediately handed to her by the bailiff, she seized his garment and, leaning on him, immediately breathed out her life. Still much other wondrous things were to be seen there, and the evil lasted three full years, and was afterward driven out.\n\nIt was probably one of those kobolds at play here, who brought this woman, who was most likely innocent, to misfortune. The Brigittines at Fanten were likewise visited with manifold demonic plagues. Jumping about, they sometimes uttered a roaring and frightful noise; they were at times driven out of their appointed seats in the church, and their veils torn off; also their throats were sometimes closed so that they could take no food. The manifold changing and harsh affliction lasted among most of them for ten years. The cause was sought in a maiden who had formerly been inflamed with love for a youth whom her parents would not admit into their kinship. As she was now in great sorrow on this account, the demon persuaded her, in the form of the youth, to take the vow in the convent, and she allowed herself to be clothed. Once received into the order, she was seized as if by a frenzy and gave all a horrible, manifold changing spectacle. Her affliction now communicated itself, like a contagion, to many other sisters; who then, based on her own confession, held her to be the cause of all their misery.\n\nWith her, who was subsequently captured and taken away, the jailer begot two children; she was then released, and lived on, burdened with the suspicion of maleficium. The matter had occurred a considerable time before in Marienbaum; he therefore wrote for information to a nun there, and she replied: there were still two nearly eighty-year-olds from that time remaining, and from them she had often heard talk of it. They said: for much would they not have wished to forgo this heavy misfortune, ordained by God; because they had felt what gifts of grace and enlightenment had been granted to them from it; which their lives also bore witness to. At that time many learned people had been sent for, who had closely examined the terrible appearances, and attempted to penetrate into their interior and to provide help. But the more trust one placed in their advice, the more violent the evil became. \\[Page 247\\]\n\nThen the afflicted finally recognized the matter as God's work; submitting themselves from the whole heart to his mighty arm, and completely denying themselves, they had ordered their lives according to God's Word, and now the evil gradually vanished. Wier adds: how he himself had visited the convent, and made inquiry with one of the old women who had borne the evil for ten years. She likewise praised God for it, and said: that she, if age permitted, would gladly let the same floods of misfortune pass over her once more. She counseled me: that if I should ever be consulted by such sufferers, I should certainly never permit exorcism. One who was such a suffering sister was, on the advice of some, beaten with rods by her brother; as madmen still advise today, as if the demon could be driven out with rods. She, however, from shame and displeasure, gradually wasted away: but in dying she sang; and when asked about the cause of her singing, she answered: because she did not doubt her eternal salvation.

The greater part of them---there were about seventy in the house---were possessed by evil spirits, and were plagued and tormented in manifold ways. They climbed like cats up walls and roofs. Their faces, when they began to grow angry, they distorted so hideously and gruesomely that, if one looked upon them, even the most stouthearted man's hair stood on end. Often they ran toward the water as if they intended to drown themselves; but as soon as they reached the edge of it, they stood stock-still and said: The great man (as they were wont to call God) will not permit it. In general, whenever they wished to do something evil but could not bring it to pass, they always said: that the great man forbade it. They spoke, in the expression of Laurenz Regals, with playing tongues, all sorts of foreign languages which they had yet never learned; and they knew---what astonished people the most---to recount what was being handled at that very moment in the town hall. \\[Page 248\\]\n\nReaal reports on it: one of the children, in a fit, told the orphanage mother Catharina Gereits that the council was still assembled and had just resolved to send her son Johann Clae\u00df to The Hague. It was found that this was indeed the resolution. The council had indeed deliberated on it and withdrawn the sending; but the child had nonetheless seen correctly. In their possession, the children were accustomed to raging and raving terribly, especially before the doors of certain women. In particular, one named Bametie was hateful to them; they unanimously accused her of having bewitched them, and against her they now poured out all their malice; so that these women were always held suspect on that account and cried out as sorceresses. But this suspicion fell most heavily on Bametie, because she was already blamed for having been out many times at night to practice her juggling or sorcery. Moreover, she had also been found many times in the Holy Ghost Chapel (Amsterdam was still Catholic in its government at that time) as if dead and entranced, with hands and feet spread wide apart, stretched out on the floor before the altar; and she would then come back to herself after several hours out of this ecstasy, with deep-drawn sighs.\n\nThe aforementioned orphans, when they had climbed up the tower of the old church like cats and played on the carillon bells with their fingers, were accustomed to sing in loud voices from her: We will not go away from here until we see Bametie sitting in the fire. At times they also pointed with their fingers at a spot, as if they wanted to show the bystanders the witch; who, however, was then of course not to be seen despite all efforts, although the children cried: she had just come there to do them some harm. They were also, no one knew why, exceedingly enraged against the schulthei\u00df, reviling and scolding him harshly, and calling him a Deventer cake; either on account of his long, lean figure, or because he let them open their mouths with this children's fare to stop their scolding. ---\n\nThe children slept together in one hall, and thus the contagion can easily be understood. But one also sees clearly in this case: that the infected, when no visible center is present from which their evil has proceeded, seek out such a one for themselves; around which they then unite. It is understandable that a center of this sort must have an analogous state dwelling in it to their own, and that seems to have been the case with this woman. She had, as it is written, convulsions; whether these were of a higher mystical kind, or demonic, has not been ascertained. Probably, if we give weight to her evil reputation, brought about by her nocturnal outings, they alternated intermittently with one another; whereupon the possessed held to those corresponding to them. As, moreover, in the higher order of things, connections form themselves in love and attractive instincts; so in this lower one through hatred and repulsion; the choruses are thus scolding, arm"}, "The Afflicted Children of the Hoorn Orphanage": {"start_char": 802099, "end_char": 806605, "pages": "249-250", "keywords": ["- of 300 children by witches in mohra", "witch trials"], "verbatim": "It is understandable that a center of this sort must have an analogous state dwelling in it to their own, and that seems to have been the case with this woman.

As, moreover, in the higher order of things, connections form themselves in love and attractive instincts; so in this lower one through hatred and repulsion; the choruses are thus scolding, armed against their choir leader, and striving against him.\n\nSomething over a hundred years later, in the orphanage of Hoorn in 1670, something quite similar occurred. At that time in this house there was a very large number of children, --- both boys and girls, older and younger, but none under twelve years, and mostly all of the most unruly sort ---, afflicted for several months with a severe plague; on account of which many doctors were consulted, who did not know what to make of the matter. \\[Page 249\\]\n\nBut the plague consisted in this: that the aforementioned children suddenly and unexpectedly fell to the ground, and as soon as they came to themselves, they were pulled and torn with such force that it was unbearable to witness: how they trampled with their legs, knocked their heads against the earth, struck about with their arms, gnashed their teeth, and howled and barked like dogs. In some, the belly rose and fell so violently that it seemed as if a living creature sat within it, which was moving; or as if little barrels were being rolled about in their bodies. They then had to be held by three, four, five, or sometimes even by six people; of whom one held the head, two others the hands, one sat on the legs, and sometimes a fourth had to press down the belly. When they lay still, they were stiff and rigid like wood; so that if one grasped them only by the head and the feet, one could carry them wherever one wished, without their making the slightest movement. This often lasted for several hours in succession, even into the night until twelve, one, or two o'clock.\n\nOne of them, the daughter of Tryn Lucas, one of the oldest orphans in the house, was seized by the plague early in the morning around eight, when the morning bell rang for breakfast. The attack lasted without any interruption until four in the afternoon, when the bell rang again for vespers. The sick girl thought, when she came to herself again, that she had only lain in the attack for a short time, because she believed she heard the morning bell ringing once more. These attacks most often came upon the children when they saw others seized by it; or also when they merely heard someone in the plague gnashing their teeth, or howling and barking. Some therefore were accustomed to run away at once, but mostly in vain; unless they happened to be near the gate and could leave the house. Thus, through hearing and seeing, so many often contracted it that there was scarcely enough household staff to be found to help them. Secondly, it also fell upon them very frequently, and almost always, during spiritual exercises, for example under the sermon, from which they therefore had to be kept away; then during the catechetical instruction, which the preachers gave in the house from time to time; but most of all during the prayers, which were recited aloud by the assistant masters. \\[Page 250\\]\n\nThe more earnest and fervent these prayers were, the more God was implored therein to curb the power of Satan; the worse the children had it, and they fell into the plague all the more. During the days of carnival, almost an entire week long, the afflicted were the most unbound and reckless children; indeed so unrestrained, as if they were full of fire and inner burning. Throughout the whole time they could not be tamed, and the plague was in this period, as it were, hidden and suspended. No remedy helped the children, except first of all prayer, which, at the request of the superintendents and the house mother, was constantly observed in all churches and assemblies by all except the Catholics. Furthermore, that the afflicted were allowed to live outside the house with other citizens. When they were away, they soon felt improvement, and the plague began gradually to diminish; so that they were all, sooner or later, de"}, "The Demonic Children in Bourignon's Ryssel Institution": {"start_char": 806680, "end_char": 808270, "pages": "251", "keywords": ["- demonic speech in various shapes", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": " returned from time to time. The last case, which we shall here mention only in passing, is the one with the children in the institution that Bourignon established in Ryssel. There were about fifty of these children who received instruction and upbringing in the institute, and the matter seemed to be proceeding well; when the directress first noticed traces of the demonic in some children, and soon convinced herself that the evil was spread through the whole group. The children made their confessions to the pastor of St.\u00a0Sauveur, and there the Sabbath reappears with its revelries, dances, and all its debaucheries.\n\nThese assemblies united, according to their own account, all estates: young and old, rich and poor, noble and ignoble, priests and laymen; and each took his place in due order, as his rank in the world brought with it. One confessed that from her youth she had had a spirit which had grown up with her, and remained with her day and night. Her malice was here chiefly directed against the mistress herself, over whom once an assembly of 25 persons had been held to find means of removing her from the way. Here too, without doubt, a pestilence had come among the children; the essential moments were present, as in other cases; but the matter was taken from the viewpoint of the school. They were those Arcadian shepherds of the old, earnest Sabbath who had gathered together; and now, in childish fashion, boasting of things inaccessible to them, they imitated them among themselves as best they could; much like how they in play practiced handiwork, or behind the d"}, "The Four Demons Possessing Mother Johanna of Loudun": {"start_char": 812199, "end_char": 814623, "pages": "253", "keywords": ["- in mother johanna of loudun"], "verbatim": "Vital Relations\n\nLife, which stands open to the most palpable things in creation, also most frequently allows possession to take hold; and thus serves most often the seizing entity as the ground and bearer into which it enters, and from which it then, as much as is permitted to it, overlays the rest of the person. But the outer ground of life is split and divided into multiplicity, and many levels of life are arranged one above the other, and grouped around certain vital central points. The occupation, whether the involuntary one or the one deliberately brought about, will therefore articulate itself in the same way, and can then appear multiply divided. We have already spoken of this multiplicity in connection with possession; here we encounter it again, and we must discuss it once more from another viewpoint.\n\nFather J. J. Surin, a man of deep inner life, has recorded some observations on this from his own experience. His provincial had sent him to Loudun to become the confessor of the possessed nuns there; at a time when the main scenes of the drama there had already passed. In his life\u00b9 it is said of the chief person among them, Mother Johanna: there were four demons that held her in possession. \\\"Balaam had entrenched himself in her humor, her temperament was the playground in which he operated; and since she was by nature very merry, he did nothing but play pranks; he spoke of eating, drinking, and other pleasures, which then drew her mind away from all contrition and made her averse to all divine things.\n\nIsaacaron spoke of nothing but carnal delights and impurities. Behemoth had seated himself in the wrathful part, hurled a multitude of blasphemies about, and spoke of nothing but planned misdeeds, murder, and manslaughter. The fourth, Leviathan, had seated himself in pride, and haughtiness, boasting, and ostentatious display were his constant occupation. He sometimes gave her a proud bearing, so that she appeared resplendent like an abbess; she then spoke with head held high in pride of wondrous things; she knew the holy fathers, and cited them with great understanding and penetrating eloquence. She kept herself neat in her attire, and had a majestic appearance; while a thousand jests and vanities swirled in her head.\\\" \\[Page 253\\]\n\nTheir spirits sometimes bestowed upon her a greater beauty than she possessed by nature; especially a loveliness in her gestures, in her beari"}, "The Young Man and the Spirit Serug": {"start_char": 826308, "end_char": 834739, "pages": "257-260", "keywords": ["- spirit serug"], "verbatim": ". An example will suffice to make the entire process clear to us. Bekker\u00b9 tells it from his own experience, to be sure in his superficial, arbitrarily rational manner; but nevertheless circumstantially enough to serve our purpose. A young man, about 16 years old, of dull comprehension, mentally and physically not of particular drive or vigor, had become conspicuous to his fellow pupils: through the strange gestures, eye-rollings and contortions of his body, which manifested themselves in him. He had let them eat ripe cherries in the middle of winter; and after first offering them to them, he had then eaten them himself. In the church he had shown them his empty hands, and then taken money from the pews, and asserted: that he did all this with the help of an evil spirit, which he called Serug. \\[Page 257\\]\n\nThey had once caught him at it, how he had drawn a circle with chalk in the school, and described it with some figures and numbers, which Bekker had seen. On being asked: what does that mean? he had stood long silent and still, and blinked with his eyes; but finally confessed: that he had drawn it to speak with him through it. Likewise, when asked: how he had come by the cherries and the money? he had replied, that he had given it to him. Asked: who this he might be? he had, blinking again and looking in front of him, named Beelzebub. Into a hole in the wall, which according to the rector's deputy was much too small to admit his hand, he had nevertheless thrust it in, and upon pulling it out had torn a stone along with it. More sharply questioned, he explained: that the spirit sometimes appeared to him, now agreeably as a maiden, now repulsively as a goat; that it had happened to him for the first time in Leeuwarden, where money for playing had been lacking to him, and that he had given him a handwriting.\n\nThe school authorities resolved to exclude him from it, and to inform the parents of the matter; who now agreed upon it, to keep him at home. A maid watched over him during the day, wherever he went and stood; at night he slept with his brother, who was a clever man, and entirely capable for this guardianship. They prayed for him in the church; the maid was accustomed to seat him in front of the pulpit, where he was exposed to the eyes of many people as well as the preacher. There he would then sit stiffly looking in front of him, often blinking, more frequently shaking with his feet, like one who is freezing, and suffering from a twitching of the sinews, as epileptics are wont to have; without, however, ever having fallen in the church.\n\nThe maid knew much to tell about him, but this rested only on her belief; because the father, who loved solitude, mostly remained in his chamber; but the mother, although very sensible and attentive, was very burdened with bodily weakness. He presented himself to Bekker as if he felt remorse and sorrow, but took no heart toward the one who scolded him more often; for which reason this one henceforth spoke more kindly with him, and once took him, with the prior knowledge of the parents, on a walk; after having previously bought him some sweets for him, with which, as he very well knew, his trust was most easily to be gained. He now told him on this walk: how his spirit Serug still kept him company, and spoke invisibly with him in various shapes; and that he, in order not to be tormented, still sometimes yielded to him in evil.\n\nHe wanted to lure him out continually, and although he had little desire for it, he had nevertheless been very well entertained by him twice at special places: first in the little house by the gallows at Leeuwarden, which then transformed into a beautiful hall; and then in Franeker, on the first piece of pastureland that lies northward from the road by the city moat. There was a pit there, which, except on the hottest summer days, is otherwise mostly full of water; that pit had suddenly dried up at that time, and been full of fiery flames. In it many devils had been flying about, who declared that hell indeed had such a fire as well; but they knew how to render it harmless. To a company of men and women who had been there, splendid fare had been served; there had also been music, dancing, and games. \\[Page 258\\]\n\nPeople had spoken Hebrew there; a language which he understood as well as his mother tongue, but outside the assembly not at all. He named those present, among others a woman from Leeuwarden who already had a reputation for this. At night, after he had slept a little, his spirit would make him rise; and lead him along a height which he never saw by day, to that place. Once he had brought him to the sea dike at Harlingen, and made him thrust through two men with the sword that he had placed in his hand. Bekker asked: whether he remembered any Hebrew word at all? He said: Yes, one, \"alley,\" which I use when I want to call him. Bekker replied: that is no Hebrew word, and wrote for him on a small coin the words: *Soer nimmenin Satan! Depart from me, Satan!* with the instruction: to ask the devil about the meaning of the words; and instead of the few shillings that he always used to give him, to demand from him a Hungarian double ducat.\n\nHe later reported back: that he had shown the words to the devil, and he had told him that they meant: he should go away from him; but the double ducat he had promised him if he would only first go out; but that he had neither been able nor willing to do. His parents had told Bekker that he sometimes fell into a faint, and then told much about the places where he had been. He asked to be called if it happened again, and now found him once lying flat on the ground, rolling about on it; holding his eyes now closed, now stiffly open; his body mostly drawn together, and in violent motion. After that he came to himself again, and began to speak weakly, but gave little account, except that he was better; though later on he knew how to tell much again.\n\nOnce around the summer solstice, when his brother awoke early in the morning, he saw him lying next to him in bed; with closed eyes in sleep, making all the movements of the mouth, the hands, and the body like one who greedily eats and drinks there. He named now the name of Serug, now of another spirit; and demanded this and that from one or the other tree. He then acted like one who receives something and bites into it; he praised the same and laughed, as if it tasted good to him. Finally, when he received something that did not taste good to him, he scolded his spirit vehemently, something like with the words: Now you deceive me again, and give me what you well know that I do not want at all! With that he drew back, and struck with the flat of his hand so forcefully that a mark of it could be seen on the wall, and from the rebound of it he half awoke. Only when he parted from the meal in the pleasure garden did he clearly make the gesture of taking off the garments that he had received there; and that he had to leave behind, in order to go home in his own clothes. He now got up, really dressed himself, and performed his prayer. The brother then said: You were absent the night, where have you been after all? \\[Page 259\\]\n\nHe denied it at first, and now related, under the seal of confidentiality: that he had been in a most beautiful garden, full of delicious fruits, in good company, and so forth. The brother now sought to make it clear to him from what he had seen that it had only been fantasies; but he could not be persuaded, and instead asserted that the brother had only seen his semblance. Moreover, he must have had great bodily flexibility to wriggle through everywhere. Once Bekter was called into his house, where he found the entire household in consternation. He had gone out onto the street in a moment when the maid had turned her back; and when they searched for him, he met the maid on her return from the baker's, where he had bought and paid for something.\n\nNo one could comprehend how he had gotten out; the doors were locked from the inside, and the courtyard door was barred; he had not been in front, and had not gone through the courtyard, that much they knew. He would say nothing, but finally pointed out two missing bricks in the roof, toward a roof beam; through that the spirit had led him. In the rear building there was a cellar opening under a bedstead, which without bed and straw was covered only with bare planks, on"}, "The Bewitched Woman of Lyon Vomiting Needles and Pegs": {"start_char": 839229, "end_char": 842500, "pages": "261-262", "keywords": ["bewitched woman in lyon", "witch trials"], "verbatim": "\nOne of the oldest facts of this class, of which reports exist, is that which occurred in Lyon. Gaufried, Abbot of Altatuba, reports in the life of the holy Peter Tarantaise---which he, at the command of Pope Lucius, was commissioned by the abbots of C\u00eeteaux and Clairvaux to write: At the castle of Lugdunum there was a pious man who had a daughter bewitched by a woman, suffering from a desperate illness, who could endure neither her husband's presence nor even his sight. Her mother had therefore summoned a known sorcerer to her. He had examined the matter, declared her bewitched, rubbed tree bark, and herbs incantated with words, and administered them to her in a cup; finally, he also gave her a bite in the arm. The woman now partook of her ailment, but from that time on it was as if needles were pressing out from her heart from time to time. She then suffered violent pains, until through the bite in the arm---which did not scar over---needles were driven forth by a secret force. More than thirty of them had thus emerged one after another; when a famous abbot, whom Gaufried, because he was still alive, hesitates to name, passed by on his way, and under the hospitable roof of the father was received, saw the sick woman, and heard her misery recounted by the distressed father.\n\nThe account was immediately confirmed by the evidence of the eyes, as the woman anew felt a needle painfully; in a short time it had advanced to the opening, and soon some blood, then the needle itself, appeared. It was soon pushed further forward, and now a lay brother in the abbot's retinue approached, grasped the protruding one, and drew it out bloody, to preserve it for all time to come as a witness to what had occurred. The abbot betook himself to prayer, and touching the wound, said in the power of faith: henceforth neither iron nor steel shall come forth here. It happened thus, but the matter had only changed, because the power of the sorcery was not yet entirely broken. \\[Page 262\\]\n\nNow there came forth, namely, small wooden splinters or pegs of oak or ash wood, thicker than thorns and a little longer, in place of the needles; however, they were no more of equal length than those had been. Sixteen such had, in the course of a year and fewer months, come from the woman; when finally the holy Peter Tarantusius, to whom this miracle had been reserved, arrived on the scene. The woman was presented to him, as he had ordered the evening before, while he offered the Mass. At that hour the seventeenth peg went from her, which the sacristan drew forth before the eyes of all. The woman went to confession with the saint, received absolution, and after he had administered the Eucharist to her, he bade her be calm; henceforth no matter of any kind would go from her in such a manner. Freed from all enchantment, she lived thereafter with her husband, bore him children; and, as it is said, still alive at the time of this writing, she praises the wondrous power by which she had been deemed worthy to be tried. Peter de Frarineto is called her father, known and honored by all the inhabitants of his place---this is said here; thus ends Gaufried the account, so that if anyone harbors doubt about the event, he may seek conviction from what he is unwilli"}, "The Possessed Child of Utrecht Vomiting Inedible Objects": {"start_char": 842674, "end_char": 845499, "pages": "263", "keywords": ["- possessed children"], "verbatim": "pretation entirely by the circumstances. So the case that Dr.\u00a0H. ab Heer cites in Observ. VIII. A nine-year-old child had, in May 1625 at Utrecht, taken a sorrel leaf into its mouth, which a woman had offered it, and thereupon felt such pains that it fell down as if dead. Since no medicine helped, it had been exorcised; and now needles, glass, feathers, hairs, nails had burst forth; and it was noticed: as often as that woman approached it within 200 paces, it was each time more severely tormented. She was later arrested and condemned, and with the noose around her neck, confessed herself guilty of the child's harm. This was now brought to Dr.\u00a0Heer in mid-September, and remained with him for some weeks; and he now relates simply and plainly what he observed in it during that time. \\[Page 263\\]\n\nHe had summoned the Father Modestus of Li\u00e8ge. When this one was still 50 paces distant from the room, the child fell down as if dead; no breath could be felt in it, the fingers and toes were so twisted together that I could not separate them with anything. When the Capuchins began to read the exorcism, the child moved with such violence that six persons present could not hold it still; I myself had grasped its head, and felt how it was drawn, through an inner convulsion, with the nape ever against the shoulders. Meanwhile the body swelled up beyond all measure, and at ten paces distant a sound could be heard from it, as when the unruly waves strike against the forepart of a ship; and the child again burst forth from time to time with those objects. I begged the exorcists, out of pity, to pause. They had scarcely spoken the last word when the sufferer lay still; and when they had departed, the hands and feet unclasped; it soon stood up, ate and drank, and played, as if nothing had happened. This repeated itself always; but when I saw that the ejected things were completely dry, I expressed my doubts to those present. The child now cried: Do not doubt that these things come from me! With that it seized my hand and led it into its throat. Feel, it said, a headless pin, which will come forth at once! I really felt it; but when I thought to grasp it firmly between the fingers of my left hand in its throat, it was torn away from me with force; the child, however, now bent over to vomit, and I received it into my hand.\n\nI have at other times often felt the points at the mouth of the stomach; and when they now came up, then many who wanted to perform experiments meant that they could hold the end of the point fast in the middle of their throat; but all their efforts were each time thwarted. --- Heer healed, more than a year later, the child with an ointment from the hazel bush, which he had found in Carrichter; and the healed one was completely well three years later, only that every year duri"}, "Maria von M\u00f6rl's Torments with Vomited Objects and Bed Infestations": {"start_char": 845773, "end_char": 855435, "pages": "264-267", "keywords": ["driving demons with sign of cross and angelic salutation", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "the hard objects in the lower abdomen before the vomiting. In more recent times something similar happened with Maria von M\u00f6rk in Caltern; at that time, when the conflict within her had not yet been resolved, she too had to endure this temptation.\n\nShe began on July 25, 1832, with an unnatural cheerfulness, which, except for the communion days, otherwise continued uninterrupted until the middle of September. In this state she committed various foolish acts, no longer called even her best acquaintances by their names, gnawed with great haste at her own hands as well as at those of others; and wept when one tried to deny it to her. From time to time she would then cry out in the midst of this frenzy: O my God! O, what misery is this! When she came to herself again in lucid intervals, she knew nothing of what she had said and done; and when her siblings made her aware of it, at most a dim recollection of it would dawn on her, and she showed herself extremely dismayed by it. \\[Page 264\\]\n\nThis agitation, whose focal point, as the gnawing reveals, had been in the plexuses of the stomach region, had entered only in the company of a new affliction, which had begun on the same day. For on the aforementioned day, one first noticed in her mouth lumps or pins and other similar things; on which she bit vigorously, and which she gave up again only after long efforts. This phenomenon repeated itself daily in frightful manner two to three times, and continued for eight long weeks until the middle of September. Pins, needles, spirally twisted wires, pieces of glass, horsehairs, nails of all kinds came forth one after another. Most came out of the mouth, following a stabbing pain that she felt in her entrails; whereupon these objects were immediately vomited up amid violent convulsions. The confessor, dismayed by these events, could scarcely bring himself to credit the evidence of his eyes; he therefore reported what had occurred to the parish priest of the place at that time, Mr.\u00a0Eberl. This man had visited her more often earlier; her appearance had never led him to suspect any unusual state that had come over her.\n\nWhen, therefore, the occurrence was reported to him, he must have felt struck by the communication; and, as was natural, he expressed his doubts about the truth of the strange things, and how perhaps some deception might have crept in. When it was replied in the meantime that similar doubts had also arisen earlier with the confessor, but that he had been compelled to yield before the evidence of the facts; he went there to take insight into the event himself. He found the afflicted one in violent convulsions; she threw herself, when the crisis approached, backward over the pillows; and since her mouth stood open thereby, one could easily see deep down into the gullet. The priest now had more than one opportunity to observe how the objects were driven up in it, sometimes placing themselves crosswise, resisting the expulsion; and gradually forced higher and higher up, finally entering the mouth, and then, as if blown out by a wind, being expelled.\n\nInitially fearful, he soon gathered courage at the confessor's urging; and whenever he again caught sight of such objects---needles, nails, or pieces of wood---he reached into the gullet and drew them out deeply, so that any possibility of deception was entirely ruled out. To this day he still preserves many of the things that he thus helped bring to light.\u00b9 Not only through the mouth did these objects leave her, but also through the lower passages; under great pain, the sharp things---as she called them in the local dialect---were expelled from her; and one could hear them, if metallic, clinking as they fell below. In the same way, similar objects emerged externally from her after she had felt the pain in her side or elsewhere, when she straightened up, as if they had forced their way through her skin. \\[Page 265\\]\n\nIn May of that year, a paralysis had set in at her left foot, so that she could not move it. In the following September, finally, a board nail more than three inches long worked its way through the skin of her leg, and the limb immediately regained its former flexibility. The same happened sometimes at the back between the shoulder blades; at other times, however, also at the head, where they opened a way out for themselves. It was remarkable in this that the straight pins did not advance, as would have been the case if they had been introduced from outside, with their heads turned outward; rather, the points were turned outward, so that, since they sat fast and could only be grasped with force, the confessor and others often wounded themselves bloody before they managed to pull them out. All these sharp and injurious objects caused her no bleeding, and left no suppurating wound behind; except when one had injured her through incautious removal of them. But once they were finally removed, the sufferer regained control of herself and felt greatly relieved.\n\nAlong with this phenomenon, there was also another closely related one, that of the strange infestation of the bed. On the bedsheet, under it on the mattress, on the straw tick, needles, straw stems, nails, hairs, pieces of glass, and so forth were found; and scarcely had the bed been cleaned when, sometimes in the presence of the very same persons who had removed the earlier objects, quite similar ones appeared in the same place, and the cleaning had to be repeated. As long as these bed infestations were around her, the sufferer found herself in such agitation and mental confusion that she not infrequently cried out with a distorted face, flashing eyes, and protruding tongue: she wanted to kill herself; she was damned anyway, she wanted to go with the men who were turning her bed topsy-turvy. Immediately afterward she would complain again of painful stinging in the eyes, in the lower body, on the chest; she howled and cried miserably, often tore out whole handfuls of hair, and wanted to jump violently from the bed out the window. It is noteworthy that the maids who made the bed never found the mentioned infestations; except when the confessor was present in the room. He had, as was natural, taken all precautions, as far as it was at all feasible, to keep such objects---as are usually found in the sweepings---away from her. All the women who approached her had been instructed to pay close attention to needles and whatever similar things they carried on them. But all caution proved useless; the things gathered around her, as if drawn to her. One day, as they were just cleaning the bed again, Marie suddenly began to tremble and called out quivering: Oh! Oh! The confessor asked: what was the matter?\n\nOh, she replied, now something ugly and large is coming and wants to get into my bed. In fact, one heard how something from the next room, continually striking against the floor, clattered through the open door toward the bed standing close by it. The confessor commanded: Seize it in the name of Jesus, and hand it here! Oh, she cried, it is already running away again, and now it is going into the next room! One of the girls present had the courage to follow it there and pick it up; and there it was found to be a piece of hard wood that had been wrapped with human hair, alternately striking the floor with one end and the other, thus coming along. \\[Page 266\\]\n\nThe confessor, dismayed by all these occurrences, inquired in many ways: how it could be that these strange objects came to her in this manner, and even pressed into her body; but she could give no definite information about it. She said: sometimes it seemed to her as if they entered through the eyes, sometimes again through the mouth; it also seemed to her at times as if they were thrown up against her breast and throat by a little man. Only this one thing was certain, and she maintained the same for a long time afterward: that each time abominable men of dark form surrounded her, and offered and presented to her shapes of various enjoyable objects and delicacies, chestnuts, pastries, and confections. Then she lusted after what was offered, and it was immediately forced upon her by the men; whereupon always violent stabbing and cutting pains would set in, until all that stuff was removed from the body again.\n\nThe whole matter had been sought to be concealed as much as possible on account of the sensation; but it came out nevertheless, at least in part, and the strangeness that lay in the entire occurrence made people suspicious; they suspected witchcraft and evil arts, and many who had previously wished well to the afflicted one withdrew from her. Therefore the confessor said to her one day: You see, Marie! how all these hideous things lead people astray; therefore turn yourself in fervent prayer to God, that he may take the plague from you. She promised to do as he had said; and then after some time, when she had gone to holy communion around the middle of September, she said: The Lord has said: I am to have the general prayer held for me in a church, then the torments will cease. But to you I am to vow strict obedience in all things; then you can forbid, in the future, accepting anything from the abominable men, and I shall remain freed. Both happened with the foretold success.\n\nThe plague was meanwhile not entirely at an end all at once. For a long time Marie still lamented that the dark men still stood at her bed, and wanted to give her abominable things to put her to death. Once also, when through convulsions her mouth was forced open, three needles were thrown at once into the open throat in the presence of the confesso"}, "Gertrud Fischer's Demonic Greed for Swallowing Money and Needles": {"start_char": 859489, "end_char": 866779, "pages": "268-270", "keywords": ["gertrud fischers demonic greed for swallowing money and needles", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": " death; so in another form an affect more akin to the metal, namely greed and avarice. Very significant from this side is what took place with Gertrud Fischer in Frankfurt on the Oder during the time of the Reformation. \\[Page 268\\]\n\nThe daughter of a man named Martini Fischer from Lebus; she had become weak in the head while with him, as the preacher Andreas Ebert of Frankfurt first made known in an open letter, whereupon a citizen of that city, Georg von Kulisch, took her in and had her cared for according to her needs for a long time, during which she became partly healthy again. But this recovery of hers soon changed again afterward, and her ailment grew worse and worse the longer it lasted; so that she became possessed by the enemy of truth, and began to do all manner of things.\n\nAmong other things, the preacher says, it happened thus: whenever the aforementioned maid grabbed hold of someone by the coat, sleeve, beard, or otherwise, she always seized money current and valid in this land; and she would quickly carry it to her mouth, chew it, and finally swallow it down, unless the people took it away from her beforehand; and likewise much of this still remains among the citizens here. But after such things had happened from her many times, it was reported to the honorable council, which had her taken into safe custody and care. But what wonders she performed would well deserve a special book to be written about them. She also seized 405 needles, which she chewed and also swallowed. In addition, she spoke good Upper German, which had previously been unknown to her; for she could speak nothing but her mother tongue, namely Markish, and even now can speak no differently. Therefore I was moved, as a preacher in that place at the time, to write to the reverend and highly learned Herr Doctor Martin Luther, according to this enclosed copy, and to ask him to share with me his counsel and good judgment in this matter. To which he replied to me: that it was a strange, unheard-of thing to him, if it were so; and therefore he requested that I write to him in my own hand the truth of it, whether it was indeed real money.\n\nThis I wrote back to him, that it was in no way otherwise. Thereupon he gave his recognition and shared with us his advice: that one should lead the maid into the sermon, and pray to God for her; so would it in time become better with her. In the meantime, she had been exorcised by a papist priest, in the hope of driving the devil out of her; over which she made much mockery, and scorned all such things. But when she was led into the sermon, the devil through her often accused me of lies during the preaching; and when I commanded him to be silent, she was silent, and thus she was helped through the common prayer; and I now know not what has happened to her, and what she has done, for to this day she is here a fresh and healthy serving maid. Which all is known and manifest not only in Frankfurt, but also in the whole Mark and many other places.\n\nSomewhat later the following document appeared concerning her and her doings: Before all men in general and each one in particular, of whatever rank, estate, or condition they may be, who shall see, hear, or read this our public attestation, we, the judges and aldermen of the city of Frankfurt on the Oder, do hereby make known, by means of our friendly service in advance, that the worshipful Herr Erasmus Alberus, preacher at K\u00fcstrin, has earnestly requested of us, and sought from us a true testimony concerning the wondrous event which occurred here in Frankfurt about a year and a half ago with a maid, who by chance seized money with her hand and swallowed it, etc., as it pertains thereto. \\[Page 269\\]\n\nWe, the undersigned inhabitants, to attest to the truth and without hesitation in declaring it, provide this testimony: that the aforementioned wondrous event and miracle is here in Frankfurt well known, and publicly evident and widely rumored; that the said maiden, by mere chance, wherever she has touched with her hand---be it upon a coat, beret, doublet, hand, sleeve, head, beard, or upon a table, bench, wood, stone, earth, wall, or the like---has grasped therewith money in her hand, brought it to her mouth, and bitten into it so that it has cracked between her teeth; and she has let the coin protrude from her mouth, so that it could be clearly seen, and thereafter swallowed it, whereby she has often changed color in her face from a single swallow. Likewise, she has done this at night in bed while lying beside her nurse: from the featherbed, pillow, bedboard, and whatever else she has grasped, she has caught money, rustled with it, and stuffed her mouth full, so that she has horribly choked and gurgled from it, nearly suffocating, such that a light had to be kindled and aid brought to her, leaving her neck immediately bruised and blackened.\n\nPeople have also at first, whenever she has grasped at some object, swiftly seized her hand before she could bring it to her mouth, and by force pried open her hand to take the money from it, whereupon she has screamed horribly. She has also handed over the money from her own self to certain honorable folk, both men and women, after making such a grasp; and at times she has stuffed her entire mouth full of money with her hand, rustled it about in her mouth, and gnashed it with her teeth. And it has been all manner of valid coinage, such as Markish groschen, pfennigs, Stettin, Meissen, Polish, and Bohemian money, as well as Prussian groschen; and among them some bad, reddish coin as well. Otherwise, when questioned, she has spoken strange and wondrous words. All this, as reported above---and much else besides---through grasping at money, she has done to herself.\n\nIn truth, it happened just as described, as many people, including council members, are still present who have the money that they received from her. To confirm the truth of this, I, Theobald D\u00fcrrekragen, the honorable and wise council's appointed and established judge at the court in Frankfurt an der Oder, have knowingly had the court's seal affixed to this letter by the assessors. Given on Saturday after the Nativity of St.\u00a0Anne, 1585.\n\nOne sees that much is still missing for this remarkable appearance to be fully investigated and recorded in all its circumstances. Only one thing must be regarded as firmly established---since one cannot assume that the people were foolish enough to let themselves be deceived by sleight of hand---that is, the money-grabbing and the swallowing of what was grabbed. Georg Sabinus, who in the fourth book of his Latin elegies dedicated a special one to it, has added some decisive circumstances therein. A voice called out to her in her sleep: \"Arise, great riches will be given to you!\" She awakens and sees, not far from her bed, a distinguished man who says to her: \"If you will be my beloved, then you shall enjoy all my treasures that lie hidden in the earth.\" She is said to have replied: \"Whoever you may be, you shall be mine.\" Now the apparition suddenly takes on a different, terrible form; the girl is frightened by it and by the glow of its eyes, and becomes enraged.

The most instructive thing that has occurred in this way is what at the end of the sixteenth century took place in the Upper Palatinate. On 20 November 1694, the twelve-year-old son Theodor of the pastor Z. D\u00f6derlin there, at the church of Berolzheim near Weissenburg am Sand, had begun to complain of headache and stomach ache, with complete loss of appetite; but the mother, who believed he had perhaps eaten something harmful while playing in the garden, had given him a home remedy, which however on the following day had only produced vomiting and stool, with the expulsion of some worms.\n\nIt took another six days of all sorts of remedies to still the vomiting; but since fainting fits, heart palpitations, and epileptic convulsions followed, they called in the physician from Weissenburg, Dr.\u00a0Wider, for counsel; who advised on worms, and prescribed helminthogogic remedies, mixed with stomach-strengthening and anti-epileptic ones. These too were applied fruitlessly for a whole month, and the symptoms of the illness multiplied; they therefore discontinued the medicines, and resorted only to a bloodletting, after which the patient's strength increased somewhat, and only the vomiting persisted. Wider therefore prescribed, on the 5th of January 1695, pills against it once more, as well as against the worms; whereupon the boy for the first time began to feel a large worm in his intestines, and on the 2nd became so deranged that it seemed his end was at hand. But when he came to himself again, he filled the house with weeping and lamenting, threw himself from the bed onto a bench, and rolled about on it, continually crying out that the worm would kill him with its bites. They gave him all manner of things, especially garlic juice, after which the worm ceased biting, and the boy stopped his wailing. The doctor prescribed what was fitting, but the worm proceeded once more to bite, now on the right side, now on the left; and the boy rolled about screaming again, and the pain nearly drove him to madness. \\[Page 273\\]\n\nThis continued for so long, until someone advised soothing the creature with milk; it then indeed desisted from biting, but was by no means thereby expelled. They immediately administered suitable medicines, of which, however, only the Marrubium album drove a millipede out through the stool. Since the tartar emetic weakened the boy immensely, he was conveyed under medical care to Weissenburg, where quicksilver and the decoction of Hypericum procured him three days of rest; but upon that the worm, ascending as far as the pit of the stomach, began once more to stir most violently. Only by means of milk could it be pacified; with bitter drinks it bit furiously about. Abstinence from food and drink brought on labored breathing, swelling of the face, and choking fits. They administered such violent purgatives that it seemed either the boy or the worm must succumb to them; all to no avail. They were therefore obliged to resolve on sending him back again to his parents. In the meantime, someone had made the proposal to the despairing ones, to assist the patient against the worm with warm cloths, and this proved effective: they could drive it or lure it backwards or forwards with them; it came sometimes as far as the gullet, and had to be repelled with vinegar.\n\nFrom that time onward the boy could retain the foods that pleased the creature; the others, however, it cast back from the gullet. They obtained the judgment of the medical faculty at Altdorf; who, since medicines would not avail, proposed a dissection to be performed by a skilled hand; and since this did not seem agreeable, the most renowned physicians in Nuremberg, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Oettingen, and Switzerland were consulted, but their counsel remained wholly without effect. Full three hundred times a day the worm ascended into the throat; the belly meanwhile swelled enormously from sundry creatures, which from time to time could be felt externally; but these always remained below, while that one alone mounted upward. They placed the boy on his head, and had him inhale the vapor of milk. The worm, following after the milk, came up so far that it became visible to those standing by, but could nevertheless never be drawn forth; only another millipede was expelled. Only before the Marrubium album did the creature show aversion; its decoction always drove it from the stomach into the intestines, under great pains to the boy; which pains endured until it had reached the lowest bowels. But when it was just on the point of being expelled from there, it suddenly mounted back up to the stomach, and celebrated its happy return with some merry leaps. \\[Page 274\\]\n\nIt was equally sensitive to heat; a burning wax candle, the flame from the stove, the rubbing with warm cloths drove it to flight; and it immediately rolled itself into a lump, in which one could feel a movement like that of vipers. If one brought an even hotter cloth near, it fled to another corner. When the abdomen swelled, which happened several times daily, then the strongest man could not press it down; but as soon as someone pressed the head of the worm with a finger, the others, all of them smaller, fled to another place. Rue was so hateful to them that, if the boy smelled it, ate it, or laid it on the abdomen, they were all thrown into great rage and agitation. They likewise abhorred radish, vinegar, and everything bitter; but the sweet was exceedingly pleasant to them, and the scent of a musk ball made the larger worm leap up perhaps a hundred times in a quarter of an hour. From then on, however, he abated somewhat in his wildness; for although he climbed up into the throat more than a thousand times every day, and each time had to be removed by swallowing, whereby the noise he made could be heard a hundred paces away; yet he bit only when provoked to anger, and then only lightly.\n\nNow one of those folk healers appeared, of the kind that the faculty is wont to call medicaster, who advised removing the bitter, but recommended sweet and fatty things. His advice was followed, and whether it was due to the application of these remedies or to chance, from March 4 to 26 the following creatures emerged from the boy's mouth and anus, to the astonishment of all witnesses. Namely: 162 larger and smaller centipedes, ten or twenty at a time; two moths; a white worm with a black head, while a similar one bored into the navel; four fast-running worms, each with twenty stinger-bearing feet; four hopping butterflies; four other swiftly moving red maggots resembling large ants; a white centipede; 42 dark-colored caterpillars of various sizes; finally, a full-grown beetle. Not all emerged through the mouth, but some crawled along the palate to the ethmoid bone, and were then driven out through the nose with a warm cloth. They were all very lively and so nimble that, if one did not catch them immediately, they soon ran away. They did not come mixed together, but the like kinds appeared together; the smaller insects were surrounded by the four larger ones, and by some smaller earthworms, as if by a dam; and some of them lived 3, 8, up to 12 days, until they finally starved to death.\n\nThe parents joyfully considered the boy already freed; but on March 26 an interlude occurred that led them to conclude it was sorcery. As the other children were playing in the garden on March 26, they found in a new bird's nest a white bird's egg painted with red figures; but when they opened it to eat, the yolk was black and sprinkled as if with gunpowder. For this reason they threw it against the fence and washed their hands; but as the parents and neighbors now came running up because of the novelty of the thing, suddenly a rooster fell down dead; two hens, however, were seized with convulsions, and on the following day the crossroads in the garden was found sprinkled with a black powder. That incompetent doctor now had the boy's abdomen covered with plasters, gave him all sorts of things unceasingly, and had the belly bound and pressed upward. Now, from that day until the end of May, four frogs of medium size were driven out from the boy's mouth, by applying stinking things from below but sweet ones from above; one of which had a beetle, a mealworm, and a frog in its stomach, the second slime, but the other two nothing in their stomachs. When the first one had been expelled, some friends advised: to bring the boy at night to the fish pond, where there were many frogs; in the hope that, if he still had more inside him, these might perhaps be lured out by sympathy with those in the pond. \\[Page 275\\]\n\nScarcely had he, however, come near the pond, when his belly swelled beyond measure. The worm, which for several weeks had not bitten, now began again its old cruel game, and rose up in the following days perhaps a thousand times; but the frogs in the boy's body answered those outside with the same croaking and the same motion; so that, on account of the uproar in his body, the boy from then on never again dared to go out at the time when the frogs croaked. After the expulsion of the frogs followed some toads, then 21 lizards of various sizes; the frogs as well as the toads were lively in color, and of different kinds. The larger span-long toad killed the smaller one at once with her breath, and filled perhaps a glass with her slime, which she then swallowed up again. Before the separation of all these animals went a feverish chill, followed by a tickling in the throat. Then the animals were vomited up lengthwise, without particular pain.\n\nThe last lizard was covered with a piece of skin from another dead one. It was now believed that the great worm too had in some way departed. But when the boy, after his daily prayer, went to bed again, which he had shunned for two days out of fear, and now fell asleep easily; he suddenly raised himself up, and cried: something bitter had flowed into his throat, from which his lower belly was swelling; at the same time the worm began to rage again. Since the insect nest was now destroyed, it ran up and down freely and as if in a fury, and bit most violently at the slightest movement of the boy. Whether it had been vomited up and returned, or had remained, had to remain undecided.\n\nBut when on the 9th of June friends who visited the boy brought him confections, the creature was thereby lured several times into his throat; and caused him such distress that he lay down on a cushion of the bench by the window in the sun; and there, holding a piece of confection in his hand, he became a little beside himself. The creature, lured by the sweetness, now sprang forth; to those present it seemed a viper, and the boy's body fell together at once. The housemates searched most eagerly for the viper in all corners for a whole hour, but could not find it. So that it might not slip into the boy's mouth again, it was resolved to convey him over to the house of a trusted neighbor; where he remained for eight days sound and cheerful. Meanwhile, some remedies were provided to the boy by a respectable person, which were supposed to be particularly salutary against sorcery: a water, a powder for fumigating, another with an oil to rinse the mouth, and an amulet. At the same time the remedies of the unqualified doctor were continued, and now the boy vomited up, from the 17th to the 21st of June, some shoe nails, half of a chain ring, seven pieces of bowls, stones among which two quite large ones, a ball of hair, pieces of white and red eggshells, two forks one of which was wound around with hair, a piece of a medicine glass, finally two large nails.\n\nAt all these things, as at the departure of the animals, were present the collector Knebel, the pastor of Trommetsheim, and many other most credible people. All the objects came singly, under sometimes hours-long exertions; which at the forks were so great that they produced an exceedingly strong hoarseness. The boy now felt nothing more, and the parents resolved to take him home again; but they placed him in another room, and he slept with a relative who watched over him the whole night until six o'clock in the morning. \\[Page 276\\]\n\nShortly after she had fallen asleep, the viper returned, however, to the horror of all. Since they applied triple doses of the medicine and manifold prayers, she soon departed again in that light ecstasy which overtakes the severely exhausted; after she had previously bitten his foot, so that he came to from it, and ran screaming into the father's study, showing the swollen foot and calling for help. Some theriac and the anointing with scorpion oil soon restored him, so that his parents took him to church on Sunday. But as he was on the stairs, from the lower story to the upper, the viper pursued him again; so that he hurriedly slammed the door of the upper hallway behind him and cried for help. Trembling as he was, he therefore could not be let out of sight the entire day; during which he then, in the evening, expelled one of the forks from himself. He spent the night in the house of C. Bambrucker, under the watch of his grandmother and constant prayer, peacefully. But early in the morning at 6 o'clock, he felt the viper in his body again, and one could plainly hear it hissing.\n\nHe was therefore brought home once more; the grandmother, who constantly remained at his bedside, did not take her eyes off him, in case she might see the creature at its exit. In vain, however---as soon as sleep and that kind of ecstasy came over the boy, it had gone out for the fourth time, and bit him so fiercely in the hand that the blood began to flow from it. The parents now sent the boy, under the care of his grandmother, to Weissenburg, and there he continued the use of the medicines under good care. He still vomited some smaller frogs, and three pieces of a smaller viper, such as the son of the apothecary H\u00f6chstetter had found him lying on the ground and picked up; but now, after some tufts of hair had passed from him in Rotenburg in July 1695, he became completely health"}, "Widow in Bergamo Hearing Demonic Voices": {"start_char": 909032, "end_char": 909719, "pages": "282-283", "keywords": ["ingeburg hearing demonic laugh", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "ith a poor widow in Bergamo, of whom the exorcist Brognoli tells: when she was alone in her bedroom, she was always afflicted by the speaking of many voices.

I now spoke to her, and she laid out for me clearly and distinctly everything that the demon was accustomed to do with her. From this report I soon understood: that she, although she denied it, had nevertheless given the demon an indirect consent. For when she felt his nearness, through the swelling of the affected parts and the violent titillation, then she did not take refuge in prayer; she did not call upon God and the Virgin for help, nor upon the angel of her chastity; but instead she hurried to her chamber and lay down in bed, so that thus the Evil One could more conveniently and pleasantly perform his business.

In Bergamo, in the year 1650, a young merchant, about twenty years old, was plagued by a Succubus, as the same Brognoli\u00b3 told him: several months before, as he lay in bed in his chamber, the demon had appeared to him in the form of an exceedingly beautiful girl whom he loved. When he, seeing this form, had cried out, she had immediately commanded him to be silent, assuring him: she was that girl, and had fled from the house because her mother had mistreated her with blows; and now she came to see her beloved. He himself knew very well that it was not his Theresa, but some house-demon; nevertheless, after some words and embraces, he took it into his bed. After that the form said to him: she was not the girl, but a demon who loved him, and therefore joined herself to him day and night.

Just as clearly does this agreement reveal itself through external signs and the boldness of the behavior. In the year 1649, Brognoli recounts, I was to exorcise a possessed woman on the order of the Apostolic Nuncio; she visited me the following day at the door of the monastery of St.\u00a0Bonaventure, dressed in the habit of a Tertiary of St.\u00a0Francis, but very vainly adorned, quite beautiful and about 35 years old. When I asked her: What sort of torment the demon was inflicting upon her? she replied: It has been about 18 years since he, in the form of a handsome youth, has abused my body; which happened, as now, so also during the lifetime of my husband, when he would then send a sleep over him and do as he pleased. In the conversations that I have with him, he always drives me to blasphemy; he also often brings me out of the house at night to consort with other sorcerers.\n\nI now began to exorcise her in her house; but soon noticed that she was in complete agreement with the demon. For she brought me a message from his side: if I wished to free the woman from him, I must proceed according to the ancient *Rituale Romanum* and according to the *Flagellum Daemonum* of Menghi. I must first inquire of him the signs of the maleficium, which were laid in a human skull; and moreover procure for myself the fish gall with which the young Tobias drove the demon out of his wife. The intention to trick him with this was all too obvious; he therefore replied: he had no need at all to let himself be instructed by the devil on how to drive him out of believing and God-fearing men and women. She should therefore tell him: he, being a spirit and easily traversing all seas, should search out that fish in them and bring it to the fish market in Venice for sale. I would then, if it seemed right and fitting to me, take the liver and do with it what seemed appropriate according to Catholic custom.\n\nThe cunning woman fell silent with a smile and only begged me to visit her again when she summoned me; and I left her with good admonitions to repentance and to the use of spiritual means to free herself from the power to which she belonged body and soul. Since she in the meantime had me summoned a second time to the house of a painter where she lived, the painter's maid, a pious and God-fearing woman, warned me against her: she was a sorceress who went out of the house half-naked and nude. When I therefore entered her room, I asked her: whether she had followed my admonitions? She answered: the demon had resisted and not wanted her to follow them. From which it was clear to recognize: that she had sought me out not to be freed from the demon, but to draw me into perdition.

The author of the *Specimens of British Prose Writers*, Barnett, relates an example of this from his own experience. Fifty years ago there lived in a village of Somersetshire an old woman who was generally regarded as a hag. Her body was dry, bent by age she went about on crutches. Her voice was hollow, of a mysterious but hypocritical solemnity; from her eyes went forth a piercing, stinging light that struck the one who looked at her with silent terror. \\[Page 286\\]\n\nSuddenly a young, healthy man of 21--22 years from the same place was haunted by the Alp; so persistently and frequently that his health was attacked by it, and within 3--4 months he was weak, pale, emaciated, bearing all the signs of a life drawing to its end. Neither he nor any of his family had any doubt about the cause; and as he was resolved, he decided to wait for the hag while awake. For a long time he did not succeed in this; finally his resolution prevailed, and he now heard at midnight a soft, cautious step on the stairs. She came to the foot of the bed, climbed onto it, and then pressed herself slowly up along his feet. He let it happen until she had come to his knees and wanted to throw herself upon him with her full weight.\n\nNow he seized her with both hands by the hair and held her fast with convulsive strength, while at the same time calling out to his mother, who was sleeping in the nearby room, that she should bring a light. While she ran for the light, the two of them struggled with each other in fury on the floor, for so long until, with the first glimmer from the stairs, the woman tore herself from his fists with supernatural force and vanished from his eyes like a flash of lightning. His mother found him standing there, still breathless from the exertion, holding both hands full of hair. When he, says Barnelt, recounted the incident to me, I asked him curiously where he had put the hair. He replied: It was clumsy of me that I did not keep it; that would have proven the identity of the person best. But in the storm of my emotions, I let it fall to the ground; and she to whom it belonged took care that it never came before my eyes again. But on that occasion I covered it over in such a way that she has not returned since to plague me. It is strange, he added, that while I seized her and wrestled with her, although I was certain that it must be she, yet her breath and her entire being seemed like that of a blooming young girl. The man to whom this happened still lives; he told me the story more than once; I can therefore vouch for the truth of the effect, whatever one may think of the cause.\n\nThis cause one can seek first in a vision of the agent himself, without great danger of erring, which went forth as a critical one into that struggle, which yielded with the first glimmer of light and let the one who had returned to consciousness glimpse the hair in the intermediate moments, which then vanished later on.

She now became earnestly repentant and confessed continually amid many tears; but there was now nothing to be devised that could free her from her incubus: neither the sign of the cross, consecrations and blessings, nor even the altar sacrament itself, which terrifies the angels, would bring her help. The evil now seemed to persist in her as a punishment and only vanished after many years and much prayer. In its course, she once complained, on the eve of Pentecost, in 's-Hertogenbosch to a pious sister, Christine, of her misfortune, which took away her courage to go to communion.\n\nChristine now said to her: Lie down calmly and go tomorrow to the Lord's table! For I will take your evil upon myself. She now went away joyfully, slept in peace, and rose in the morning and hastened to the sacrament. But Christine did not take seriously what she had undertaken; when she had gone to bed, however, she perceived, as she was falling asleep, that it was restless in her straw bedding, as if a piglet were stirring and moving about. She therefore got up unconcerned, sought to drive the animal away with the distaff, and then lay down again. She was roused again; and since this repeated itself several times, she finally recognized the trick, devoting herself to prayer; but in doing so she was so tormented by the Evil One that she had never endured anything like it. In the morning she said to the other: I am casting your evil back from me again, for I have escaped the violence of the tempter only at the risk of my life"}, "Youth in Bergomese Territory Attacked by Old Woman Apparition": {"start_char": 924377, "end_char": 927880, "pages": "287-289", "keywords": ["youth possession in bergomese territory 1645"], "verbatim": "ence of the tempter only at the risk of my life.\n\nThe misfortune is, however, also present where it appears as illness and possession, sometimes so malignant that it brings the reluctant one to death without any consent. In the year 1645, in the Bergomese territory, there was a youth of about 25 years, so attacked by a maleficium that he could neither eat, drink, nor perform other natural functions, indeed could scarcely breathe or speak. He came to Brognoli, who blessed him; and since the demonic revealed itself through various movements and exertions, he subdued it by means of ecclesiastical regulations. He now advised the youth to go to confession and communion, and then to seek out in Brescia a famous exorcist, because he himself at that time did not yet engage in exorcism. But this youth, once he recognized himself as possessed, cast the suspicion that he had caused the same upon an old woman, whose malice toward him he well knew. \\[Page 288\\]\n\nUpon returning home, he therefore said to his friends and household companions: that he had been so ill-treated by the woman; he knew that she had done the same to others as well, and he therefore wanted to report her to the Inquisition. In the meantime, he had asked the superior of the monastery in his place to take him in for that night with a friend who was devoted to him. This was granted to him, but after the fourth hour of the night, while he was fully awake in the room, with the window and door standing open, he saw that woman come into the room, climb onto the bed, and seize him by the throat with her hands, so that he was nearly strangled. He sought to hold her off from himself with all his might, reviling her with many abusive words; and so great was the force that he exerted in the process that his bedstead was broken by it; all of which his companion heard, without, however, seeing anyone.\n\nAnd it did not stop at one time; after half an hour, the apparition attacked him in the other bed, where he lay with his friend, and sought to drag him out of it. But the companion held him back, embracing him, sensing a great force and much exertion against his struggling, but otherwise still seeing no one. The result was that the head and neck of the unfortunate one swelled up so much that he was entirely disfigured by it, and behaved like a madman; foaming at the mouth, gnashing his teeth, striking himself against the floor, and intent upon hurling himself down from it. In the morning, he told me everything, in the presence of many witnesses; with a rough and broken voice, he complained about the old woman, and added: \"The woman torments me, and will not stop until she has killed me.\" And that came to pass around the ninth hour of the same day, when he died.\n\nIt was said to have been observed that that old woman had not been in the church that morning in her usual manner; she was not seen until the evening after the death of the wretch. The suspicion also seemed confirmed by the death of her niece, who died within less than a month of an unusual illness; a death that was attributed to a maleficium, because she had loved that youth passionately, and now, grieving over his death, had recounted that it had happened through a bite that the old woman had offered him. She herself betrayed herself: by afterward threatening the youth's companion, who had been an eyewitness to everything, with the same death if he did not keep silent.

As he reports, when I had returned to Bergamo in 1650, a girl had me asked through her confessor for my help, who told me: she had been visited daily for some time by an incubus, in the form of a clergyman whom she loved, and could by no means free herself from his power; although she resisted bravely 1) Alexicacon Disp. II. No.\u00a0505. p.\u00a0163. 437 and had performed great penances for this liberation. I now instructed her in all acts of faith and trust, advised her to attack the incubus with all kinds of curses, mockery, and derision, and then blessed the room and the bed. I then commanded that in this room, with a lamp burning, in another bed, two other nuns of the same congregation, venerable and mature through their age, should lie down there undaunted and with fresh courage, in such a way that, while one slept, the other knelt watching at the bed and continually observed the one plagued by the demon, whether she showed any movement in her face, around her mouth, or on the rest of her body. If she noticed anything like that, she was to immediately wake the other and command the demon in the name of the Lord to depart from there, and to pull the one plagued by him out of the bed. All together were then to kneel, pray the psalm Miserere, give themselves the discipline, and after that recite the Litany of the Holy Virgin.\n\nBefore midnight of the first watch, the incubus came and began, invisible to the one watching, to press upon the sleeping one; she in turn made some movement with her mouth and face and gave a thin, lamenting sound. The one watching woke her companion; both together now fearlessly seized the sleeping one to pull her out of the bed. But the demon held her back strongly; they pulled harder but could by no means overcome the power of the demon. Finally, the command that I had advised came to one of them; and she commanded the demon in the name of Jesus to depart from there! He now fled, and the three immediately carried out what I had assigned to them. On the following day, when I visited the convent and heard what had happened, I encouraged them to continue fighting bravely against the demon, blessed the room again, and commanded the demon never to dare approach her again. Now, although he showed himself in the following night and even ventured to enter through the door, he did not go as far as the bed.\n\nThe afflicted one saw him indeed in the form of the clergyman whom she loved; but she drove him easily to flight by invoking the name of Jesus. On my part, I repeated my advice on the following day, as before. In the third night, the apparition indeed returned, but invisibly, and only causing some slight noise in the chamber; then he completely left the afflicted one, and she was completely freed with God's help. That was without doubt the most rational manner of treatment. The nun had directed her entire intention toward the object of her love, and he appeared to her as a spiritual vampire"}, "Woman Freed by St. Cajetan from Serpent Demons": {"start_char": 931024, "end_char": 932661, "pages": "290", "keywords": ["- cajetan driving out serpent demons", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "\nIn the moment of the attack, she was pressed upon; the heaviness that she felt, she also exerted outward, and the other nuns perceived this heaviness when they tried to pull the sick one out of the bed. The instructions that the exorcist had given, effective in two directions, uprooted the evil at its root; and it vanished, now gradually making a stepwise lysis. Otherwise, it is St.\u00a0Cajetan whose help is frequently invoked in such cases. In life he was distinguished by the greatest purity, and he tolerated nothing that could cast even the slightest shadow upon it. Therefore he had the property, both during his lifetime and after his death---as proven by many witnesses in the process---of freeing those who had long suffered from the temptation to lust.\n\nAll who had come near him for this purpose attested: he then exhaled the most delightful scent of oranges, which, spreading far and wide, lingered for a long time. But the agrumi are held, on account of their evergreen nature, to be a symbol of virginity. Therefore he also drove out the demons that incited to such things, and his life recounts many instances thereof. Thus there was in Vicenza a respectable woman who suffered from this affliction. After a strong attack she had come near to falling; when the Saint, to whom she had commended herself from the bottom of her heart, appeared to her clothed in light, and drove out the evil spirits in the form of serpents.

This first made her host suspicious whether she might not be subject to the deception of Satan; and he insisted that she consult a pious and learned man. She replied: she had already done so many times, and received various answers; later, however, agreeing, she had, in order to withdraw herself again from this promise, spent 15 days outside the house with a friend.\n\nLately urged once more to approach a bishop who was present at that place on this account; she had finally yielded, had gone to the bishop, and he had directed her to a Dominican, a pious, experienced man proven in the examination of spirits. But she would not follow this instruction; the father would demand a general confession from her, and also, to test her, would withhold communion from her for a long time; moreover, an inner voice had forbidden her to go to him. In the meantime she spoke various suspicious things again. She was without all sin, even without venial; God hearkens to her in all that she desires. She sees the inner man; God unites himself bodily with her, and she often falls into ecstasy outside herself. \\[Page 292\\]\n\nShe said to her hosts: they could attain the same if they would only renounce the imprint of evil with which they were born, and all high-mindedness and all vanity and discord. When it was replied to her: we do all that, she rejoined: You still have a veil before your eyes, I will pray to God that he remove it from you! Suerz now pressed all the more eagerly that she go to the father, with whom he had previously spoken, and she finally consented. He received her kindly; but she was at first somewhat abashed, and said nothing. The father then said: I have heard much of your rare virtues; I hope through you to gain closer knowledge of them for my own good. But she answered: I am a sinner; and to that he: That comes surely only from your humility; I hope you will not hide your graces from me. They are rare, these graces, on account of my sinfulness, said she; and he again: Your ecstasies and illuminations, the seeing through of spirits, the foresight, all that is well known to me; God does not grant such things to wicked people.\n\nShe now came two or three times out of herself before the father; he fell upon his knees and besought God for his help, and then he said to her: O blessed one, you who are so closely united with God, and enjoy his sacred embraces! She rejoined: In that you speak truly! So he spoke back and forth, and plainly recognized that she was exceedingly vain, thought greatly of herself, and had a mighty desire for praise and honor. He said to her now: It seems to me in all this that your humility yet deserves a higher reward; and it appears fitting to me that the body also should share in the enjoyment, as is the case with bride and bridegroom. By these words she was, as it were, transported out of herself, and said: You speak the truth, my father! and no one has yet spoken so aptly therein as you. The father then asked whether God was visible to her, how often and under what form he united himself with her.\n\nShe took pleasure in these questions, and said: she did not see her God, but felt him very well; she rejoiced for full two to three hours in his embraces, and gave things to understand that cannot well be repeated. The father said in response: It sometimes dreams to me that I come into company with many people; do you also have such dreams? She answered: Indeed! and when asked: what then the people did together? she replied: They worship God, eat and drink, and are in good spirits for two to four hours. She now went away very pleased, and promised to come again soon. At home she immediately recounted: such as this she had found none before; she would never have another confessor, he had approved everything about her. Believe me, she added, he will yet learn much from me that is not in his books! for the father is actually a simple man, of no great intellectual gifts, who would easily be deceived. Thereafter she went to him more often, and soon let herself out openly against him: that she believed in another God than the God of the Christians, and in another Virgin. \\[Page 293\\]\n\nShe lived with him as man and wife, she had already told the landlady, and confided to the landlord: that she had already been in this state of grace for ten years. When he expressed that he too wished to enter among these elect, she made revelations to him that would have determined him to expel her from the house, had not the father begged him to have patience with her for a while longer. She now advanced further, and said to the landlord, who complained of inner unrest and uncertainty on the new path: since he had begun so happily, she would not conceal from him that above all he must renounce baptism and the Christian Trinity, pride, vanity, and discord. For among them there existed an entirely different Trinity, which the father did not yet know; and when she had declared herself for this one in her night of birth, the angels of the Lord had appeared to her.\n\nShe also confessed that she was marked; she recounted how she spent the nights sleepless, lingering five, six, seven hours in the work of love with her God. Other joys, in comparison with these, were utterly void, because the powers of God were inexhaustible, and his might penetrated to the heart. On the eve of All Saints' Day she said impatiently to her landlords: Had you done in time as I have taught you; then we would be merry together tonight, on one of the principal feasts of the year. She went to bed early in the evening, and when the niece of the house, who slept with her, said in the morning: You said that you had to go to the feast tonight, and yet you did not leave your bed; she replied: You are still too young to comprehend how that can happen.\n\nShe often recounted how things went at the banquets, and spoke of three orders: the first sought only enjoyment and union with God, of whom there were 36, mostly poor and powerless women; the second desired knowledge, insight, and understanding; the third riches, dignities, honors, goods, and these were mostly esteemed people who dreamed only of ambition. There was also a virgin there, with the Christ-child on her lap; but this would first reveal itself in its glory after the destruction of Paradise. All were now filled with horror against these abominations and blasphemies; the father too had obtained what he wanted; and when she therefore appeared before him again in the confessional, he uncovered for her the abyss of perdition in which she wandered in her delusion.\n\nShe was at first frightened, and became as if stunned; then she began to weep and to accuse herself of sorcery. But the emotion lasted only a short time, then the old hardness returned, and she departed with the words: The hour of my conversion has not yet come; but you will have no cause to complain of me. At home she said that she must have three or four days to consider. But since they no longer wished to tolerate her in the house, she left it; yet she continued to hold conversations that pointed toward conversion. However, since she feared an accusation, she resolved, on the advice of her friends, to preempt it, and now accused the father: that he had sought to seduce her into sorcery, had made her deny Christ, had allowed himself attacks on her chastity, and had given her consecrated hosts in order to commit abuses with them. Confronted with him before the convent, she at first repeated her accusation; but then she suddenly fell at his feet, confessing that she had spoken untruth, and that she was the most"}, "Nun Seduced by Angel Fasting into Incubus": {"start_char": 942773, "end_char": 945927, "pages": "294-295", "keywords": ["maiden seduced by demon as youth", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "\nAs in this case a grossly demonic nymphomania, in the one who deliberately deceived herself, was elevated to the highest union; so has this evil sometimes spread in the opposite direction, from above downward. As I, Brognoli recounts, was staying in Venice in 1664, the vicar general of a bishop from the mainland came to me to seek counsel regarding the following incident.\n\nIn a convent of nuns there was a nun who was greatly devoted to fasting and abstinence, though according to her own will. Her desire and love were moreover directed toward reading profane books that dealt with the transformations wrought by Circe and other enchantresses, or those performed by the ancient gods, by which they changed men into animals, birds, serpents, and spirits. One night, the form of an exceedingly beautiful youth came to this nun, and as she gazed at him in astonishment, he said to her:\n\n\"Do not fear, my dearest sister! Are you not that nun who loves fasting beyond all measure, and have you not devoted yourself to it with your whole heart? Know then that I am the angel called Fasting, and I come to you to thank you and to meet your love with equal love. Once I was a king's son; but in my youthful years, in which you too now still stand, I greatly loved fasting and devoted myself entirely to it; so my father, seeing this with displeasure, rebuked me harshly for it. But I, disregarding his admonitions, persisted in my will; for which reason he, full of anger, cast me out of the house. But the gods whom I revered, and who disapproved of such banishment, took me in and transformed me into an angel. As they now gave me the name Fasting, they added the privilege that I may assume the form of a youth as you see me, so that I never age. Moreover, I am endowed with such swiftness that in an inconceivably short time I move from one part of the world to another, coming and going invisibly; but to those who love me, I become visible. Since the gods have now indicated to me that you have directed your whole love toward me, I come to you now to offer my thanks, to stay with you, and to serve you in all things according to your pleasure. For this reason I have today completed the great journey; so let me sleep tonight in your little bed, if it pleases you; fear nothing in my company, for I am a friend of chastity and modesty.\"\n\nThe nun, now most delighted by this speech and lured by it, took him into her bed. The first night passed well, and he did not touch her. But on the second, he began, as a sign of gratitude and love, to embrace and kiss her; then he did not cease from her by day or by night, and he admonished her never to reveal the secret to her confessor or to anyone else. He served her most zealously and followed her everywhere through the convent and the garden, like a faithful servant and companion. Finally, in the year 1664, when the time of the Jubilee came, the nun was seized by remorse in her heart and disclosed everything to her confessor, who persuaded her to reveal the matter outside of confession to the vicar general of the diocese, so that he might take the appropriate measures to free her from the evil"}, "Demonic Familiarity in Cloister Nuns": {"start_char": 945254, "end_char": 947457, "pages": "295", "keywords": ["- familiarity with nuns"], "verbatim": "But on the second, he began, as a sign of gratitude and love, to embrace and kiss her; then he did not cease from her by day or by night, and he admonished her never to reveal the secret to her confessor or to anyone else.

In this remarkable psychological case, the disordered inclination toward fasting, combined with an equally extravagant one toward the fables of the ancients, merged into one; and as the nun persistently directed her attention there, the combination personified itself in that apparition which she experienced and which belonged to the demonic side of human nature. Since she found herself equipped with beauty and youth, the third sensual element soon entered in, and by an established path an incubus was now made from the abstinent king's son. The evil gains its spread in another way when it breaks through the barrier of personality and then spreads over an entire community.\n\nBy the nature of the matter, such diffusion will occur most frequently in nunneries, where the evil itself takes root most easily; and now in close living together, under entirely similar influences, the spread of what has taken hold is promoted by the most similar disposition.

They had been, says the physician, disturbed for many years by various devilish afflictions; when suddenly in the year 1564 a gruesome spectacle arose among them. They were thrown to the ground, entirely in the manner of the act; during the course of which they always kept their eyes closed, and only opened them afterward with great shame. A young girl of fourteen years, who had been enclosed in the cloister, had given the first occasion for it. She had often experienced these strange apparitions in her bed, and had been discovered by her giggling over them; and although she strove to ward off the haunting with a consecrated stole, it nevertheless returned every night. One had placed a sister in bed with her to help fend off the apparition; but the poor thing was miserably frightened when she heard the noise of the struggle. She was finally completely possessed and wretchedly plagued by convulsions. \\[Page 296\\]\n\nWhen she had her seizure, it seemed as if her vision were impeded; and even when she gave the appearance of being in her right mind, she yet uttered strange and uncertain words that bordered on despair. Several soon followed her lead, and thus the pestilence gained more and more ground; especially when, in their great distress, they resorted to forbidden means. I examined these occurrences as a physician in the cloister on the 2nd of May 1565, in the presence of the noble and sensible gentlemen Constantin von Lyskerken, worthy councilor, and Master Johann Altenan, formerly dean of Cleve. Also present were: Master Johann Echst, excellent doctor of medicine; finally my son Heinrich, likewise doctor of medicine and of philosophy.\n\nI read, on this occasion, terrible letters that the young girl had written to her lover; but none of us all doubted for even a moment that they had been written by the possessed one in her attack. It turned out that the cause of the evil had come from some dissolute young people who, after they had, during ball-playing nearby, arranged a love affair with some nuns, soon thereafter climbed over the walls to enjoy themselves with their beloved ones. The matter had been discovered, and their paths barred; but now the devil, that thousand-cunning artist, poisoned the fancy of the poor things, and conjured up before them the forms of their friends, and made them perform the whole play before the eyes of all the world.

One may make every allowance for her imagination in this, but the event undeniably shows that the buried thing had acted just like the satyrium above, and that this effect could not be a direct physical one: that here too her nature had inverted itself, and that, in her inner being turning outward, she had acquired excitability for stimu"}, "The Mad Love Bond": {"start_char": 962017, "end_char": 962180, "pages": "299", "keywords": ["hilarion's case of love bond"], "verbatim": " nature most noble and most illustrious.\n\nHilarion tells of such a case: where a lover, on the advice of the priests of Asclepius, made use of such a bond, and the"}, "The Venetian Merchant's Daughter": {"start_char": 961604, "end_char": 963316, "pages": "299-300", "keywords": ["seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter in venice"], "verbatim": "Already Jerome tells us in the Life of the holy.

Another case, reported by Brognoli, gives us insight into the progress of the evil, once it has taken root. In Venice, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a merchant was greatly loved by her father's servant, who, in order to gain possession of her, resorted to a sorcerer, who struck her with the maleficium of love. She suddenly began to scream one night: \"I will die if I cannot sleep with this one.\" The elders ran to her, and were astonished at the girl's words, who otherwise was distinguished by modesty.

In the year 1589, there lived in Genoa a youth, who was otherwise well-formed, who suddenly burned with such fierce love toward a woman that he forgot God, and devoted himself only to this his passion. For three months, secret meetings and love letters were exchanged back and forth, until finally the youth fell ill with a violent sickness. Then it was astonishing, what and how manifold filth he spewed from himself in the presence of many witnesses: women's hair, egg shells, cotton, hair and straight pins, nail clippings and bone fragments, various iron scraps in no small number, all mixed with blood. One of the clerics, a Jesuit, exhorted him: that he should no longer allow himself to be bound by such a pernicious love affair; and finally questioned him, whether he perhaps possessed any belongings or letters from her? He confessed: that he had indeed received letters, but had torn them up.\n\nThe clergyman gave no credence to this assertion, and advised his own people to make search in his cabinets; and if they should find anything relating to the love affair, to take it away. As this matter became known to the patient through a secret voice, he demanded the key of the cabinet with terrible outcry: and when he had obtained it, he brought the same, at the exhortation of that same voice, to his mouth, to swallow it, if he had not been prevented therefrom. He then laid it under his pillow, and now lost the light of his eyes. The mother exhorted him that he, now made wise by experience, should give back the key. He therefore sought after it; but as he could not find it, he believed that it had been stolen from him; and he now began to scream and lament even more violently, as he searched the whole bed for it. Meanwhile, the cabinet had been broken open by force, and as two love letters were found in it, they were consigned to the flames; whereupon he immediately recovered the use of his sight, and saw the key lying before his eyes with astonishment.

Her parents had forced her into marriage, but after a few years her husband had died; a physician, Poiret, had now cast a violent passion upon her, and had given her such a philtre. She had felt its effect, but had suppressed it with prayers, tears, and vows. Poiret had now managed to administer a second one to her; various ills had thereupon afflicted her, and her parents had compelled her to send for Poiret; but as she distrusted him, she had dismissed him again. \\[Page 301\\]\n\nThis drove the physician out of his senses with rage; but Elisabeth soon fell into unnatural states. One half of her body showed itself stiffened in frost, and without sensation; while the other was in such violent agitations that, notwithstanding the delicacy of her constitution, four of the strongest persons could scarcely hold her. Now one saw her head (in the sutures of the skull) open itself, then close again to the astonishment of those present; while at another time it swelled up in a monstrous manner. The matter caused a sensation; the physician and his adherents spread about that it was all natural effects; consequences of the patient's cunning and confused imagination. Her bishop therefore had her brought to Nancy; six of the most renowned physicians of the city were called in; they examined the matter thoroughly, and at last gave their unanimous testimony to this effect: among the various symptoms of this illness there were some which could only take their origin in a principle foreign to nature.\n\nThe most insightful clergymen were now consulted by the bishop, and several respected bishops took part when the exorcism was applied. All declared unanimously: the patient was possessed by evil spirits, and only audacity could deny this truth. In fact, she was hurled into the heights with such violence that six persons could scarcely hold her down. She climbed in the trees, from branch to branch, with the ease of the nimblest animals. One saw her, entirely lifted into the air, turning herself about in a wondrous manner.\n\nShe fulfilled everything that was commanded unto her in the Italian, German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues, as we have already heard elsewhere; she read a sealed Latin letter, and pointed out the error of an omitted letter. Countless witnesses were present at all these proceedings. The clamor roundabout grew ever greater, the spirits of the sick testified continually against Poiret; this man at last made preparations for flight, whereupon Heinrich II of Lorraine, otherwise a mild regent, caused him to be arrested, and his trial to be instituted. The greatest caution and circumspection were observed in the matter. Magistrates, whom he had requested from France, joined with the natives to form a tribunal of ninety-four judges.\n\nThe accused found defenders; a doctor of theology wrote a book in his favor; a princess expended great sums for his liberation, and the Infanta of the Netherlands wrote on his account unto the Duke. The woman was not spared: she was accused of a hypocrisy at which the most shrewd wits would come to shame; whereupon her two daughters were also arrested, and she herself shut up on water and bread. All who took her part were slandered. A prince of Lorraine, who was a bishop, was to feed her secretly in his palace with dainties. What she did and said was twisted to the worst sense, she herself overwhelmed with every sort of indignity; her letters were broken open, and men wrote at their pleasure whatsoever they would into them; unknown persons pursued her with loaded pistols, but were disarmed in the decisive moment by a secret terror. In the morning rope ladders were found at her window, and footprints in the sand, and she was poisoned several times; a reward of a thousand pistoles, it was said, had been promised to whoever would kill her. \\[Page 302\\]\n\nShe therefore had to be guarded by watches. The prosecution meanwhile watched over her; the slanderous writings that were spread against her were refuted by the most thorough investigation of every action of her life; the exorcisms that the Duchess had instituted were at last continued at the instigation of the Bishop. The trial proceeded quietly on its course, and after the investigation had reached its goal, the 24 judges unanimously agreed upon the death sentence for Poiret. His friends managed to prevent the execution; the Sovereign ordered a new revision, with the same result; the judgment had to be carried out on April 1, 1622, and he died without showing any sign of remorse. After his death, God willed, for the justification of the judges, that Anna Bouley, the companion in all his crimes, should be arrested in Paris with all her magical documents and brought to Nancy. In the remorse that seized her, she confessed her crimes and gave all testimonies of her sorceries.\n\nThe judges, on their side, not relying on her statement alone, conducted all necessary inquiries; and finally condemned her to death, which was just as edifying as Poiret's had been terrible.

Several who had engaged in the same wicked practices were deterred by these events; some apostates returned to the bosom of the Church, and the court and nobility visibly improved their morals.\u00b9 How the folk legend, however, takes the matter, shows itself in an amusing way in the following tale. My lecturer, P. Syn. Lupus, author of the Commentary on the reserved cases of Bergamo, and on the Edict of St.\u00a0Ing., told me how he had known three men from Bergamo, followers of the priest Simon, who was notorious throughout Lombardy as a magician, and who had agreed among themselves: to demand from the demon a thousand gold pieces for each, and in addition, for all in common, the enjoyment of a beautiful girl.\n\nAccordingly, they invoked the demon, who appeared to them and promised to perform everything if they would surrender their souls to him. They were, however, first to procure some hairs from the girl and lay them on an altar in the forest, near the girl's house; where they were then to sacrifice them to him with incense and worship him as God. They pledged their souls to the demon and then went to the girl's house to ask her for some of her hairs. She refused for a time; but then pretended to consent and cut some hairs from the cow in the stable, which she handed over to them as her own. Immediately they built the altar, put on mass vestments, lit coals in the censer, and invoked the demon, who soon appeared and laid the thousand gold pieces for each upon the altar. But now the cow suddenly broke out of the stable, rushed into the forest; and attacking the magicians with horns and teeth, and leaping upon them with her legs, wounded one after the other, destroyed the altar, and overturned the candlesticks and everything. The people came running up, found the magicians thus badly beaten, and brought them before the Inquisitor; who had them seized, investigated their cas"}, "The Knot-Tying in Poitou": {"start_char": 973450, "end_char": 976304, "pages": "303-304", "keywords": ["nestelkn\u00fcpfen in poitou"], "verbatim": "\nAs for knot-tying at last, Bodin reports the following on that subject. When I was in 1567 at Poitiers, serving as substitute for the royal prosecutor at the great assizes, it happened that several gentlemen were accused before me. When I had now returned home and explained to my landlady the lawsuit in question, just as it had actually occurred---she being a respectable and well-regarded woman---she in turn recounted, as a highly experienced woman in matters of such arts, in the presence of the secretary Jakob von Beauvais, the following. First, that there were fully fifty kinds and manners of nestelkn\u00fcpfen; one, by which one could bind a husband alone. The other, by which one could prevent begetting alone.\n\nThere would also be another kind whereby one loved the other, to be sure, but nothing was forbidden to it in the utmost degree; and another whereby they loved one another most fervently, but when they were to see one another, they would horribly scratch and strike each other. Of such a story it had been told in Toulouse concerning a couple who thus stood together for three years, then without having begotten children with one another. Moreover, the woman said that one could most easily hold back the man with it; indeed, one could hold him bound in impotence for a day, for a year, for all his lifetime, at least so long as the nestel remained entwined.\n\nThere would be people who could be entwined only for begetting, not for mingling; some for whom it would be impossible to effect the entwinement; others who would be susceptible to the matter only before marriage, not after it. She also recounted that one could knot people's urine, which she called nailing shut, from which many of them would then have to die. The aforementioned landlady of ours also told us all the particular sayings and words that belonged to each entwinement; which knotting spells were yet so indistinct and incomprehensibly twisted that neither a Greek, a Hebrew, a Latinist, nor anyone of the more recent nations could have understood them.\n\nPiraitins in his eighth eclogue claims that one should make nine knots; she, however, knew only of one, and indicated of what leather and what color the knotting nestel must be. And since such things had become very ingrained and common in the land of Poitou, in the year 1560 the criminal judge at Niort, on the mere accusation of a young bride who for that reason sued her neighbor that she had knotted her bridegroom, threw the same into a dark tower and threatened her that he would not release her from this prison for her whole life unless she unbound the knotted man. Thereupon the prisoner, two days later, had summoned the young married couple to try it again.

At twenty years of age he had succeeded his father, and forthwith began a senseless extravagance. He maintained a guard of 200 men on horseback; a chapel of 25--30 persons; choirboys, musicians, chaplains had to follow him, along with a great number of other servants, everywhere on horseback, and for them, as for others, he always kept open table. Rich silver vessels, costly garments of gold brocade belonged to this chapel; a portable organ had to accompany the procession everywhere; his chaplains were called, as at cathedrals, deans, singers, archdeacons, scholasters, and one among them bore the title of bishop. \\[Page 306\\]\n\nThey were clothed in scarlet with ermine, had rich stipends, and he had several times petitioned the Pope for miters for them. At the same time he had mystery plays performed at great expense, or rather mysteries, as they were called then. He soon found those who fostered and encouraged his lusts in every way; besides many of lower rank, especially Gilles de Sill\u00e9 and Roger de Briqueville. To cover his enormous expenditures, he naturally had to squander his estates below their value; and not one would have remained to him had not his relatives taken the matter in hand, procuring a royal prohibition against selling any further possession, and a prohibition from Parliament against anyone purchasing any. In this predicament he sought help from chemistry, which was to provide him the philosophers' stone; adepts soon appeared to him: quicksilver had already been fixed, but the philosophical egg broke before it could be hatched. He now sought help from the one reputed to be the possessor of all hidden treasures.\n\nTrusted agents of this master also came to him; a physician from Poitou drew his circles in the forest; the Black One, as he said, had passed by him in the shape of a leopard; that he had remained silent was due to a fault in his preparations. He wished to return home to investigate more thoroughly; richly rewarded, he departed and did not return. A Florentine, Francesco Prelati, great alchemist and magician, took his place; and made use of a book from the Marshal's library. Later in prison he confessed how he had several times seen the demon in the shape of a young man of twenty years, who called himself Baron; how once he had given him a black powder with the command to carry it to the Marshal; and how on another occasion he had shown him a quantity of gold bars, which afterward proved to be merely a heap of sand and a yellowish earth. The Marshal on his side had made a contract in his own blood, in which he promised to give the demon everything he demanded of him, except his life and his soul.\n\nHe had worshiped him for this purpose, offering him sacrifices, incense, alms, and a feast arranged in his honor; and he sealed all this by immediately offering him, as a token of allegiance, the heart, the hand, the eyes, and the blood of a child. Now an old woman was noticed, who roamed about the country and the heathens, approaching the little children who tended the livestock or ran about begging, and flattering them, while always keeping her face half covered with a heavy cloth. She thus lured them to the castle of Raiz, where they then vanished without a trace. At first it was only peasant children and homeless ones who thus perished; but soon, with growing boldness, the city children too came in turn, even as far as Nantes.\n\nBodin recounts on p.\u00a0249, probably from the records: after the werewolf had in this manner slaughtered eight children for the devil, he at last also promised the ninth, his own, and indeed while still in its mother's womb, to kill it for him as a pleasing sacrifice by opening the same. Yet he did not attain to familiar intercourse with him face to face, and he was wont to say: the Unknown must be a common fellow, that he should shrink from associating with persons of rank. This speech of his, now, the sign of the cross that he perhaps made upon entering the circle; or the prayer that he always spoke, especially his Alma Redemptoris Mater; his attachment to the chapel that surrounded him; the secret resolve that he cherished, to atone in the end by a crusade---these were the reasons that his entourage adduced for why no such relation would come about. \\[Page 307\\]\n\nRaiz meanwhile surrendered himself to the most shameful lusts that the imagination can possibly conceive; and so had the bloodthirst in him united itself with this lust, that the unhappy victims of his brutality acquired a true charm for him only in the moment of their death, and out of grim lust he continued what he had begun in despair. He himself killed his unhappy victims with his own hand; their cries, their rattling, their convulsions delighted him, as he strove to increase and prolong them, and to enjoy this lust all the more closely, he would seat himself upon the dying ones. In the tower of Chantoc\u00e9 a whole barrel full of calcined bones of children was found, whose number was estimated at forty, all of whom this Moloch had burned in his glowing arms. According to his own confession, the number of those whom he had thus sacrificed there and in the castle of Machecoul amounted to a hundred; others were found in the privies of Suze, likewise in Nantes, Vannes; so that the total number was estimated at 150.\n\nThey were all sacrificed to the demons Barron, Orient, Beelzebub, Satan, and Belial, while the office of Easter Day was sung to them. Soon after Easter, when he had anew vowed a journey to the Holy Land, but immediately thereafter in Nantes had again defiled himself with the same abominations; he was at last, on the order of the Duke, together with Prelat and some others, arrested. The accusation was brought by the procurator of the Duke, and the promoter of the Bishop of Nantes; six or seven family fathers, whose children had gone to the Marshal and not returned, were likewise complainants. The trial was conducted in the new tower of Nantes, before the Chancellor of Brittany, the Bishop of the place, and the Inquisitor of the kingdom, Jean Merri, on charges of heresy, sorcery, sodomy, and so forth; but before Peter of l'H\u00f4pital, the President, in regard to all that pertained to his competence. He was at first very bold in confronting these; he said: he would rather be hanged by his neck than give account to the clergy, who were all stained with simony and shameful deeds. He knew the faith as well as they, and he wondered that the President should allow them to meddle in such processes.\n\nHe became, however, soon more pliable, and the censors of the church made him confess a part of his shameful deeds; the fear of torture accomplished the rest. He was confronted with Prelati, and the confessions proved Marshal, under tears and sobs, to him: Farewell, Franz, my friend! We shall never see each other again in this world. I beseech God that He may grant you patience and understanding. Be assured that, if you have good patience and hope in God, we shall see each other again in the great joys of Paradise. Pray to God for me, I shall pray for you! On the following day he confessed in public audience all his crimes, and how he had committed an uncountable multitude of other horrors; but he attributed everything to the bad guidance he had received in his youth, which had known no rule but his will and his pleasure.\n\nOn the 25th of October 1440 his judgment was read to him, he was thereupon handed over to the confessor; a procession was held for him, that God might grant him patience, and he was then delivered to the flames on the Magdalene meadow; yet, on accou"}, "The Bernese Child Thieves": {"start_char": 989726, "end_char": 990378, "pages": "308", "keywords": ["- de rais child sacrifices"], "verbatim": "\nSimilar horrors have also occurred elsewhere, and especially children have become the victims of such abominations.

But it still took another year and a half until she finally, in the year 1613, made the more detailed confessions about her misdeeds, which first of all ran thus: that all the maleficia of the convent had really been instigated by her. Then she also made confessions about her murders. She confessed: how she had murdered many children, or disemboweled them alive, in order to sacrifice them to the devil. Others she had strangled, the still-beating hearts of still others she had crushed and eaten with her teeth, especially those born of Christian parents. Many of these children, she said, I have secretly strangled in this city and the neighboring places, and then exhumed the buried ones, and carried them to our nocturnal gatherings.

The last among these, on being asked what drove him, after he had complained of his distress to him, bade him be of good courage, and promised him: if he would give himself over to him, he would give him a master who would assist him so that henceforth he would suffer no damage to his herd from wolf or any other beast, or from any other source. In confirmation of what was said, he promised him the recovery of all the cattle now lost, and in addition money.\n\nHe had accepted the condition, and had said he would present himself at the same place in 4--5 days. Since the cattle had indeed been found, he had also returned to his rider on the third day, who asked him whether he really wished to surrender himself to him. On the question from his side, who then he might be, he had replied: The servant of the great prince of hell; but fear not on that account! They had now concluded an agreement together, renouncing the Christian faith; whereupon he had offered him his left, black, and cold hand to kiss; but he had now knelt before him, and had greeted him---who later called himself Moyse, and forbade him all church attendance---as his lord. \\[Page 312\\]\n\nThis had gone on in such a way for two years, but the art of protecting the cattle had not been imparted to him; only the spirit, as it seemed, had taken care of it for him when wolves perhaps appeared. Soon after being relieved of the care of the herd, he had neglected Moyse, and had again taken part in church services for about 8--9 years; until M. Verdung induced him to renew the pact on the condition that the promised money be procured.\n\nThe meeting took place in the evening in Chastel Charlon in the forest; where many others, with blue-burning green candles in their hands, had gathered. One day Berdung, who also had a spirit named Guillemin, spoke to him thus: if he would only believe him, he would bring it about that he might proceed in his running with any desired speed. He allowed this, upon the promise of new monetary payments, and this one then anointed him, after he had stripped himself naked, with an ointment that he had with him; whereupon he immediately believed that he was transformed into a true wolf. It horrified him when he beheld the four wolf's feet and his wolf's hair; but now in his running he was borne along, swift as the wind, and this could only have come to pass through the aid of his master, who was immediately present at such a flight; although he did not see him until after he had regained his human form.\n\nMichael, anointed in like manner, had moved away with equally desired speed, such that the eye could not follow. If this had continued for one or two hours, then, when Michael had anointed himself and him anew, the human form had returned more swiftly than one might have thought; but the ointment both had received from their masters. When, after such a run, he had complained to Michael of exhaustion, scarcely able to hold himself upright; then this one had replied: this was all nothing, and it would soon pass of itself. Once, however, when he had anointed himself according to the other's instructions, he had seized a boy of six or seven years with his teeth, and killed him; but since he had to abandon him on account of the noise and howling, he had run back to his clothes, where through the other herbal ointment he had returned to human form. \\[Page 313\\]\n\nMichael had accomplished the like, and one day in wolf's form had killed a woman who was putting in peas; but the lord of Chusn\u00e9e had come upon them, and since they had also attacked him, they had not come to their purpose. Both likewise confessed how they had killed a four-year-old girl and devoured her all but the arm; the flesh had tasted good to Michael, although he had eaten but little; but it had in no wise agreed with his stomach. From another girl they had sucked the blood and devoured the neck; an eight- or nine-year-old child Peter had strangled, because it had earlier denied him alms; and after the deed, immediately at the same spot, he had begged alms for the sake of God. Michael had been transformed into a wolf even when clothed, but Peter only when naked; he also did not know how to say what had become of the hair when he regained human form. He had also run with she-wolves, and that with great lust; sometimes too the time of transformation had passed more swiftly than wished and expected. They added: also an ashen-gray powder had been given to them, with which they had rubbed the left a"}, "The Werewolf Trial and Confinement of Jean Grenier": {"start_char": 1005788, "end_char": 1018261, "pages": "314-318", "keywords": ["- lancre visit to jean grenier 1610"], "verbatim": "From another girl they had sucked the blood and devoured the neck; an eight- or nine-year-old child Peter had strangled, because it had earlier denied him alms; and after the deed, immediately at the same spot, he had begged alms for the sake of God.

They added: also an ashen-gray powder had been given to them, with which they had rubbed the left arm and hand; whereby every animal that they touched with it had perished.\n\nThe second case has emerged yet more clearly and distinctly. In the year 1603 there was conducted before the Parliament of Bordeaux, under the presidency of the first president Daffis, a jurist then renowned throughout all France for his insight and ability, the trial of such a werewolf-man from Roche Chalais in the land of Guienne; and the records of this well-conducted trial de Lanere has excerpted in his book\u00b9); from which excerpt the following circumstances stand forth as essential. \\[Page 314\\]\n\nThe ordinary judge had conducted the first examination on the spot, in the village of Paulot, upon the rumor: how there on the previous day a wolf had attacked a young girl, Margaretha Poirier; and how a youth of 13--14 years, Jean Grenier, in service with Peter Combaut, had boasted: that he had been the one who attacked her in wolf form, and would have devoured her if she had not driven him off with a stick. The attacked girl was re-examined by three witnesses, and had usually tended the cattle with Grenier. On such occasions, he had often told her: how he, transforming himself into a wolf at will, had already torn apart several dogs and two children; but that dog flesh was not as good to eat as that of children. One day, while they were again with the herd, a wild animal had thrown itself upon her, seizing her by her clothing at the right hip and tearing it; whereupon she had struck at it with her stick. But the animal had then withdrawn 10--12 paces from her, and, setting itself up on its hind legs like a dog, had looked at her with a furious gaze; so that she had run away in full terror. The animal had been thicker and smaller than a wolf, had also had a smaller head, along with brown hair and a small tail. The third witness, Jeanne Gaboriant, 18 years old, reported on various things he had said. When asked why he was now so black, he had replied: that it came from the wolf skin which Pierre Labourant, who lay chained in a mighty chain, had given him, and had told him thereby: if he put it on, he could transform himself into a wolf or any other animal. He had then done this many times, and had run about each time at the waning moon, on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays, but only one hour of the day, toward evening or morning; theirs, however, were nine, of whom he named some who ran with one another. 1) Tableau de la Constance p.\u00a0252--326. 470\n\nThis seemed sufficient to place the accused in custody; and when examined in it, he confessed voluntarily more than the witnesses had stated. He was the son of the day laborer Peter Grenier, whom he had left three months before because he had beaten him harshly; after which he had wandered about in the area of Courtras partly on beggary, partly in the service of various masters. Once a young man named Peter of the house Tilhaire had found him on the road, and had said to him: in the forest of St.\u00a0Anton there lives a gentleman who wishes to speak with you. When he had gone with him, they had found him dressed in black, on a black horse; and when they had greeted him, he had dismounted, and had kissed him with a very cold mouth; then commanded him to present himself each time he desired it, and had ridden away. This had happened three years before, when he had been 10--11 years old; and they had seen him three more times thereafter. He had let him groom his horse, had promised him money, and had handed him a glass of wine, after which he had gone his way again. But before that, he had been marked by him with a sort of spit that he carried, under the buttocks; where indeed a small, round, insensitive mark, in the form of a seal, was found on him. He confirmed the statement of Marg. Poirier as completely true, and confessed: how once at the villages of de la Doubla he had gone into a house, and had carried a child in the cradle, which he had found alone, behind a palisade in the garden; had eaten as much of it as he pleased, and had left the rest to a wolf that had been nearby. So he named several others with whom he had proceeded in the same way; but without tearing their clothes, as wolves do, rather pulling them off. He ran at the waning moon, 1--2 hours in the day, and sometimes in the night; but also on church festivals, on the day before Pentecost, in Lent, and especially in Holy Week. \\[Page 315\\]\n\nThe Lord of the Forest would then give him, every time he wished to let him run, the wolf's skin and the ointment, both of which he kept with him; and he would immediately wrap the one around himself, and anoint himself naked with the other. Peter de la Tilhaire likewise possessed such a one, and they had run together four times; without, however, killing anyone together. His father, likewise a runner, had taken him along on the run several times, and they had once together killed and eaten a girl near Grillaut. After the running, he found himself very fatigued, and his hands and feet bloody, torn by thorns and thistles. The nail of his left thumb was thick, long, and claw-like; he had had to let it grow thus at the command of the Lord of the Forest. This one did not let him out of his sight as long as he had the wolf's form; but as soon as he, the accused, lost sight of him, he returned to human form.\n\nHe was now handed over to two physicians for examination, and they found him in spirit dull, limited, and ignorant; moreover, of a black-bilious and melancholic temperament; they declared, however, that in their opinion he in no way suffered from the wolf-sickness. At the same time, the fathers of the children whom the accused had named as eaten had also been summoned and confronted with him, and it emerged that they agreed with his depositions with regard to time and place, the form of the werewolf, the wounds, the aid that the relatives had provided, the weapons or sticks that they had carried, the words with which they had shouted at the wolf, down to the smallest details. Once he had selected the tenderest and fattest out of three children, and had recounted how the brother of the father of the three children had driven him off armed, and as he fled, had called after him: je karroumteray bien. \\[Page 316\\]\n\nThe children were presented to the judge; the attacked and wounded one was indeed the plumpest among the three; and Jean Roullier, their father, testified how the brother had truly used those words. They went even further, and had him led through all the villages and houses where he had run, according to his statement; and when in one of them he found the man who had spoken those words, he recognized him at once among many others, and seized him by the arm. Marg. Poirier was also brought forward; he recognized her at once among four or five girls, and she him in turn, and showed the officials and him the wounds at mouth and chin that were not yet fully healed. His father too was heard and confronted with him; the son wavered somewhat in his statements when he saw him, and it was ascertained that misery and imprisonment had made him dull. But after some rest, he stood by his earlier statement against him; which also went to this: that his mother had separated from him because she had once seen him gnaw on dogs' feet and children's hands. The decision of the Parliament was as wise as the conduct of the entire trial was exemplary. The court ruled: the boy, whom the demon had armed against other children, must not be given up as lost; all the more so, since according to the report of the clergy who had taken charge of him, he had already begun to abhor his crime; which was evident in many tears and gave hope of winning him back to God and a better way of life. Considering, however, that he must be removed from the sight of the inhabitants of the villages where he had committed his crimes, and placed in such a situation that on the one hand a nature so neglected and estranged from the fear of God need no longer be feared; on the other hand, however, that it might be enabled to bring him back to better paths, the council has sentenced Jean Grenier: to be locked up for life in a monastery of the city, to be of service to it all that time; and under penalty of death forbidding him ever to remove himself from this place of confinement.\n\nHis father and Peter, called Tilhaire, were detained for further investigation, but after a month's term, however, released. There in his monastery, de Lancre visited him later in 1610, and learned from him still much that was significant. He was then a young man, 20--21 years old, of medium height, rather small for his age; he had wild, small, deeply set, black, unruly eyes, whose expression showed that he was ashamed of his former state, of which he had some knowledge, and dared not look anyone in the face. He had very long, light, more than usually broad, somewhat blackened, and damaged and worn teeth from gnawing around with the animals. His nails were long, and some black from the root to the tip, among them also the thumbnail, which the forest lord had forbidden him to cut; and these thus blackened ones were also half worn down, and otherwise still extraordinary, because he had used his hands in the manner of feet. \\[Page 317\\]\n\nHe was somewhat dull-witted, yet not so much that he would have been senseless on that account, and he carried out quickly what the good Carmelites, who had taken charge of him with love, commanded him. He showed little spirit, and struggled with things that required only plain human understanding; like one who had always spent his time with the herds, and seen nothing of the world. He made no secret of the fact that he had been a werewolf, and that he had run across the land on the command of the forest lord; and he only said that this was not shameful to him, since he had ceased to be such. But he also confessed without concealment: that he still felt a great lust within himself to eat the flesh of children; especially that of young girls was a delicacy.\n\nTo the question: whether he would perhaps still eat such things, if he were allowed? he answered honestly: Yes. Also the clergy told how they, in the beginning of his stay in the monastery, had sometimes seen him secretly devour the removed entrails of fish. He also once had a wondrous skill in going on all fours, and jumping over ditches like the animals. De Lancre remembered thereby another boy from Saint Pa, who had run as fast as a fleeing dog; knew how to turn around so swiftly that one scarcely noticed it, and sprang over the ditches like a gust of wind. Grenier also assured him: how he had had a wolf skin, which the lord had given him in the forest of Droilha, in the marquisate of FronSac, and which he had hidden on the roof of a barn in his village; yet he had not always brought it to him when he had let him run. His father had likewise made use of it, and on that account, and because he had let him grow up so badly, he expressed great aversion toward him; he also never wanted to see him, although he came to the monastery several times. In contrast, he had a quite special pleasure in seeing wolves, and this affection might well be mutual; since in his interrogations he had often testified: how he had always left the greater part of the prey to the accompanying wolves. His forest lord, moreover, he abhorred and cursed at that time, and said of him: how he had visited him still twice at the beginning of his stay in the monastery, which had frightened him greatly. He had promised him much money if he would serve him again; yet he had soon departed again, because he had more often made the sign of the cross against him; which he also still did now and then, so that he would not return. He died, moreover, still in the same year 1610, at the begin"}, "The She-Wolf Transformation and Distant Attacks": {"start_char": 1024529, "end_char": 1025150, "pages": "320", "keywords": ["michael's wolf transformation"], "verbatim": "the wolf running again coincides with the Sabbath vision.

He then cast her down at the feet of the exorcist; she rolled about there terribly, and clasped his knees several times, while the Magnificat was being sung in the church. Suddenly she stretched out her arms, which then stiffened together at the hands; and thrown upon the altar step, and leaning her head against the feet of the one performing the exorcism, she turned the profile of the latter toward the window for some of those present; and these now saw the figure of a cross upon the forehead, incised into the first and second skin, from which fresh and red blood welled forth. Since the Protestants present said that she could have imprinted this mark upon herself in her convulsions with a concealed iron in the form of a cross, which nevertheless seemed impossible given the stiffening of her arms; a repetition of the act followed later, shaping itself slowly before the eyes of the spectators.

Nozat, secretary of that commission; where Father Surin,---whom the most holy Archbishop of Tours had urged in a letter to conduct the exorcism in such a way that it would lead to an edifying result for the English lord Montagu,---earnestly exorcised the prioress of this convent, in the presence of that lord Montagu, and of the lords Killegren and Seandrel, both English gentlemen, as well as several other respected persons. \\[Page 323\\]\n\nWhen he now pronounced the exorcism over the kneeling woman, she leaned backward onto her heels; and as she held her left arm, in the sight of all those present, up in the air, we, along with other bystanders---namely, Monsieur de Morans, vicegerent of Monsieur de Poitiers, the Fathers Anginot and Bachelerie of the Society of Jesus, Father Luc, a Capuchin, that English gentleman, Monsieur du Fresne, a citizen of Loudun, and Father Surin---saw, on the upper part of the hand of the aforementioned prioress, bloody letters forming themselves, which combined to form the name Joseph. Therefore, we, the aforementioned procurator of the king, have written down this our verbal process and signed it, and had it signed by those present as testimony to the truth, after the court clerk had read it aloud.

Haan. An innocent, pious, twenty-two-year-old woman, of melancholic temperament, was seized in the evening of November 8, 1684, with shortness of breath, and in the night with sleepiness; and in the morning, upon rising, she saw two blue spots in both hands, and from the wrist to the bend of the elbow the arm marked with various cracks; over the elbow, however, inscribed with letters, especially N B, and interspersed with the sign of the cross. The next morning, after she had been at a wedding, she found the number of crosses---longer and shorter, deeper or shallower incised---increased by new ones on the neck, the breast, down to the abdomen; and within seven days the entire skin from the head to the heel was covered with them, and rough to the touch.\n\nThe face had at first remained untouched, but in the end it too was marked, though only lightly. On November 11, she had moaned in her sleep and wrung her hands; she had therefore been awakened, and needles were found thrust into both hands; which later played a role in various visions, along with an old woman who demanded them from her and struck her. Later, other needles had to be pulled from the soles of her feet, and on November 16 she was found outside her bed under a bench. In between, then, in the third, fourth, sixth, and tenth nights, new crosses were impressed upon her, then the signs of the planets, their aspects, and those of the simplest chemical preparations, all of which she knew well and with which she was accustomed to occupy herself for her instruction. The affliction diminished gradually until January 21, 1635; only that, as she was sewing at her neighbor's on that day, on the right a cloverleaf, on the left a trefoil, with the year 1635 lightly but clearly depicted, appeared. On both, the year showed a heart pierced with arrows, and beside it the image of a fool, with the inscription: Fool!

A moment later the brothers would be as if smitten by a breath, and feel an inner motion that increased to the point of hemorrhage; yet so that, when the attack had passed, they felt their strength restored, as if they had never lacked anything. Often it seemed to them as if they were beaten by invisible but still palpable hands; often as if they were pierced through the belly. They ascribed these things neither to the devil nor to actual spectres, but to wicked people. The seer insisted that he had positively recognized the apparitions as persons still living and even related to them; and the strangest stories were adduced in proof.\n\nThey had at the outset sought diverse medical help, but found none anywhere; what wonder, since they sought to drive out sorcery by sorcery, and went to those who were reputed to practice such arts. These assisted them on several occasions by sympathetic means, but only for a short time; because, as they alleged, the helpers were better paid by the others. What opinion I should draw from all these accounts as to the real ground of the matter I did not know. I regarded the two younger brothers, David and Friedrich, as hysterical; for their condition, especially that of the latter, pointed to a high degree of suffering. They otherwise appeared to be anything but timid, superstitious people; so that, since I noted they were Protestants --- among whom such things, especially in that district, occur even more than among Catholics --- I was inclined to ascribe the whole affair to a play of the imagination; yet on the other hand their calm narration, their ingenuous answers to embarrassing questions which I put to them, utterly disabused me of that view.\n\nAfter I had at last deliberated, and after I had to some extent explained to them the meaning of the church benediction, I gave this to them repeatedly once or twice a day. They testified that they felt easier, indeed they seemed entirely free from their plague. I therefore dismissed them in Easter week with a letter to the pastor who had sent them to me; in which I begged him, in consideration of my ignorance concerning the true nature of the affair, to make on the spot inquiries into the relations of the family, into the circumstances of the people among whom they had been raised, and in general into everything that might throw light on the matter; also himself, notwithstanding the general prohibition of exorcism, at least to employ the exorcismum probativum.\n\nAt the beginning of June the brothers, to my no small astonishment, returned a second time and brought with them a letter from the pastor, who wrote that he himself had gone to their parental house in Bischofsheim; that he had there examined and investigated all the circumstances, but had discovered nothing significant as to the cause of the matter. He had had the brothers examined by physicians, and these, as the enclosed certificates showed, had detected no bodily disease. Twice he had written to the Vicar General for permission to perform the exorcism; but the latter had only answered evasively. He had now blessed the house, and it had indeed been freed from all haunting; the half-dead cattle were now well too; only the three brothers continued to be tormented, and he therefore repeatedly begged me to apply the exorcism. The medical testimonies ran as follows --- first, that of Dr.\u00a0K\u00fchn: the three brothers had, several years before, suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage and had been treated by him; but the prescribed remedies had been without effect, because the causes of the ailment could not be sufficiently ascertained. \\"}, "The Malefice Accusation Against Louis XI": {"start_char": 1132992, "end_char": 1142923, "pages": "353-356", "keywords": ["- witch accusation salem", "witch trials"], "verbatim": "[Page 353\\]\n\nTestimony was given against one named Cory: that her spectral shape brought them a book to sign, and that she bit, pinched, and strangled them. In the examination she confessed that she had a yellow bird, and that a black man whispered something in her ear. A child of about five years was accused: that all were tormented upon whom it only cast its eyes; it bit the tormented ones in the process, who showed the marks of its little teeth on their arms. On April 11 there was a public examination before six magistrates and some clergymen. The afflicted complained against many, with terrible screaming and gnashing of teeth. Especially against one, Mistress Proctor, the screaming was most vehement; and when her husband came to assist her, screaming was raised against him as well. The afflicted usually fell down upon seeing the accused, and they were then made to recite the Lord's Prayer, and searches were also made for witch-marks, as one was believed to have been found on a certain Bishop.\n\nThe accused were always to sign the book, and then they would receive relief; one of them had allowed herself to be induced to sign through her pains, and her affliction had abated. But now she, the former afflicted one, became a tormentor; for her specter appeared to another person and pressed for a signing. One of those thus haunted by her once pointed to a spot where she stood; another who was present, though he saw no one, struck there with a rapier, and now the afflicted cried out: You have given her a thrust in the eye! The struck one soon confessed thereafter: that she had become a witch through the book, and now tormented the maid; but in the process had received two wounds, one in the eye, and a larger one on the side, of which the scar was found upon examination. On May 14, 1692, Sir William took over the government; the matter took a more serious turn, and the witches were put in irons; whereupon it was said that the afflicted felt better and were freed from their torment.\n\nA month later Bridget Bishop was executed, who always maintained her innocence. On July 19 five others followed her in death. Rebecca Nurse, one among them, had at first received a verdict of not guilty from the jury; at this, first all the accusers in the courtroom, and then all the afflicted except her, raised such a terrible screaming that all those present were horrified by it. The jury now assembled for more mature deliberation, the result of which was then guilty. All five defended their innocence to their last breath. On August 10 five more were executed, all of whom steadfastly denied their guilt.\n\nAmong them was a clergyman, Mr.\u00a0Burroughs, who delivered such a moving speech from the ladder, in testimony of his innocence, that many could not restrain their tears. But the accusers said: the black man dictated to him what he should say. John Willard was another of their number, who had earlier arrested many others; but because he became unwilling to seize ever more others, they cried out against him as well. He fled forty miles from Salem, but was recaptured, and those in the paroxysm knew exactly the time, and said: Now Willard is captured. \\[Page 354\\]\n\nIn September Giles Corey gave himself death, because he observed that the jury freed no one. Soon after that, when eight others were executed, the cart at the hill would not move properly; the afflicted said: the devil was holding it back. Captain Alden sat fifteen weeks in prison, and then escaped; likewise Philip English and his wife; their property was confiscated. In October some of the accusers, who boasted of seeing spirits, were summoned by J. Ballard to Andover, to tell him who was tormenting his wife. The people fell into convulsions after their fashion; then they named the persons whom they saw sitting at the head, and others at the feet of the afflicted.\n\nGradually more than fifty persons were also accused there. Some of those examined confessed their guilt, and added circumstances that authenticated their statements. They agreed therein with the accusations of the afflicted and with one another; they gave the time of their covenant with Satan, and their motives for it; they confessed how they had flown through the air on poles to the Sabbath, how they had mocked the sacraments there, and signed themselves into the book; and they even showed the wounds from which the blood had been taken for it.\n\nThey spoke therein of the toads that they had suckled, and showed the sores here as well; a turn of events that, as we have seen, is peculiar to the English school of witchcraft. The confusion grew ever greater; many elders believed their children were witches, many men held their wives to be such. The spirit-seers became more numerous, and they said: they saw the spirits of the murdered hovering over those who had killed them. Thus they spoke of Justice Bradstreet, who himself had committed thirty or forty suspects to prison, that he had murdered nine of them; he saved himself by flight. A dog was soon afflicted; the seers said: the brother of the fugitive was riding it. This one took flight, and the dog was killed. Another dog met the same fate, because they were seized by paroxysm when he looked at them.\n\nMeanwhile, among the accused were also many of the very best reputation, whose Christian disposition no one could doubt; and the number of the accused in general became so great that one could not imagine them all to be guilty. Also the protestations of the nineteen executed had had their effect. Thus one came to consider whether the whole thing might not be Satan's work, who thus deluded the afflicted? The clergy, at the request of the authorities, held a meeting, and here, among other things, the question was put to them: whether Satan could not appear both in the form of innocent and godly persons, as well as in that of guilty and godless ones, in order to deceive those whom he had afflicted? and they answered that he might do so. Now one began to reflect; to be sure, in January 1693 twenty-six were still examined, but only three were convicted, and none more executed. Soon the convicted obtained a reprieve; on April 25 one confessed himself guilty, and yet the jury pronounced him not guilty. \\[Page 355\\]\n\nAnd now, after the storm had lasted sixteen months, nineteen at the gallows, one voluntarily deceased, over fifty had confessed to witchcraft, over 150 still sat in the prisons, and more than 200 were yet under accusation; after the judges, like the best of the people, had been reviled, they finally desisted. The accused were set free in all the prisons, the fugitives returned, and peace was restored. With it now came the reactions as well. Since everything had proceeded from the house of the clergyman Parris, and he himself had been a strong zealot in the matter, many withdrew from his congregation and submitted a petition against him: that he had given credence to the accusations of the devil. He acknowledged his error, to be sure, but the accusers did not rest until he was removed.\n\nA day of fasting and repentance was proclaimed, to atone for the congregation. On it, one of the judges stood up in their midst and publicly confessed: that in the recently occurred events he might have erred in many points, and he humbly begged forgiveness. Six of the accused women, who had confessed their guilt, signed a document in which they, among other things, recounted: We were brought to the afflicted persons, who, as they said, fell into their paroxysms upon our arrival. Mr.\u00a0Barnard then prayed, and our hands were laid upon them, and the seized ones now said: it would become better for them again, and we were guilty of their torments; whereupon we were immediately seized and sent as prisoners to Salem.\n\nWe, however, who knew ourselves to be entirely innocent of all that, were exceedingly dismayed, astonished, and confused on account of the sudden assault; so that we almost lost our reason. Since our best friends, beholding us in such a state, believed there was no other means to save our lives, they persuaded us, out of love and pity, to confess that what those others said of us was true. But those were only confessions that were suggested to some of us by others, who said: we were witches, and they knew it, and we knew it likewise; and they knew that we knew it. Since we had now almost lost all understanding, all reason, and all mental faculties, we were not able to judge of our condition; and the most that we said was only an assent to what they chattered to us beforehand.\n\nWhen we were afterward a little composed again, and they told us what we had confessed; then we certainly said again that we were innocent, and that we knew nothing at all of such things. --- One cannot depict more touchingly and emphatically the state of mind of countless ones who stood in court in such accusations, nor more aptly portray how people, often without malice, impose their delusions upon one another. The twelve jurors likewise signed a document in which they declared: \"how they had not been able to comprehend or withstand the mysterious deceptions of the powers of darkness; and how they therefore feared, along with others, though unwittingly and unintentionally, to have loaded upon themselves and the congregation the guilt of blood.\n\nThey therefore pleaded with God that He would not impute this guilt to anyone; but all whom they had unjustly offended, they humbly begged forgiveness.\" That was now good and praiseworthy; but the executed were not thereby brought back to life. The entire narrative vividly illustrates how the good folk had entered the enchanted forest, and became all the more entangled in it the further they advanced. If we consider in this the view that was taken during the investigation: that the demon had caused the confusion; then one sees that he made use therein of two kinds of people as his instruments. \\"}, "Queen Joan's Arrest for Sorcery": {"start_char": 286602, "end_char": 287526, "pages": "86", "keywords": ["- on johanna thomana for sorcery"], "verbatim": "[Page 86\\]\n\nThe trial lasted through August, during which the lay judges, their hands laid upon the Holy Scripture, declared: As we desire---may God and His holy Word prosper us for good and for salvation---so in this matter we could find nothing otherwise than that Johanna Thomana had been the cause of the mistreatment of the servant in the service of the merchant Johannes, who is reported as possessed; and we can see and discern nothing else than that she is in truth guilty of diabolical sorcery. She confessed, and was executed on 11 September. One sees that the lay judges had judged according to their conscience; and one must believe that they had previously verified all the factual circumstances that underlay the case.

Once, after watching for a while the most strenuous efforts the toad made to get out, it suddenly turned upon him, rose up, swelling itself in an extraordinary way, lifted itself up on its legs to a great height; and then blew, without moving from its place, around itself. The enraged creature looked at him with eyes that, imperceptibly, seemed to become quite red and fiery, so that in that very moment a weakness came over him which made him swoon. A cold sweat ensued, and a flux set in, both of the bowels and of the urine; and his condition was such that his people thought him dead and lost.\n\nThe account proves, if not with certainty the physical harmfulness of the animal, at least the injurious effect produced by the deeply rooted belief in its poisonous nature. Thus it will be the most apt symbol in the northern countries to express the inward-closed, poison-swollen, treachery-breeding power of Evil and of witchcraft. Just as doves and other birds, lambs, hares, stags comported themselves tamely toward the saints, so the toad will in particular be the beast of the monsters. It will furnish a suitable ingredient in the poison-kitchen, and appear as the most fitting form into which the witch herself is metamorphosed, or in which the evil spirit hides itself. Therefore the toad has always played a large role in the witchcraft realm. Peter Grey of Toulouse already relates: an unhappy priest from the diocese of Soissons had asked a witch in what manner he might most effectually take revenge on his enemies, and she had advised him: to baptize a toad under the name of John, and then cause it to eat a consecrated host. After that he was to tear it apart, and might prepare from it a poison that would bring death to all his enemies; which indeed happened. The affair was discovered, and she was handed over to the flames. That took place in the year 1460. Therefore it is these creatures that form the flock of the Sabbath. There they are herded by children at a brook, to whom a white rod is given for the purpose. The animals are clothed in red or white velvet, have a small bell at the neck, and sometimes on the feet; and witnesses testified that they had seen the daughter of the Lady of Martibelsarena dancing at the Sabbath with four such animals; she carried one so clothed on her left shoulder, an unclothed one on the right, and two similar ones on her fists, like a huntsman his hawks. \\"}, "The Withering of Richard III's Arm": {"start_char": 839217, "end_char": 841214, "pages": "261-262", "keywords": ["- emerging from heart and arm"], "verbatim": "[Page 261\\]\n\nOne of the oldest facts of this class, of which reports exist, is that which occurred in Lyon. Gaufried, Abbot of Altatuba, reports in the life of the holy Peter Tarantaise---which he, at the command of Pope Lucius, was commissioned by the abbots of C\u00eeteaux and Clairvaux to write: At the castle of Lugdunum there was a pious man who had a daughter bewitched by a woman, suffering from a desperate illness, who could endure neither her husband's presence nor even his sight. Her mother had therefore summoned a known sorcerer to her. He had examined the matter, declared her bewitched, rubbed tree bark, and herbs incantated with words, and administered them to her in a cup; finally, he also gave her a bite in the arm. The woman now partook of her ailment, but from that time on it was as if needles were pressing out from her heart from time to time. She then suffered violent pains, until through the bite in the arm---which did not scar over---needles were driven forth by a secret force. More than thirty of them had thus emerged one after another; when a famous abbot, whom Gaufried, because he was still alive, hesitates to name, passed by on his way, and under the hospitable roof of the father was received, saw the sick woman, and heard her misery recounted by the distressed father.\n\nThe account was immediately confirmed by the evidence of the eyes, as the woman anew felt a needle painfully; in a short time it had advanced to the opening, and soon some blood, then the needle itself, appeared. It was soon pushed further forward, and now a lay brother in the abbot's retinue approached, grasped the protruding one, and drew it out bloody, to preserve it for all time to come as a witness to what had occurred. The abbot betook himself to prayer, and touching the wound, said in the power of faith: henceforth neither iron nor steel shall come forth here. It happened thus, but the matter had only changed, because the power of the sorcery was not yet entirely broken. \\"}, "Sorcery Accusations in the War of the Roses": {"start_char": 939269, "end_char": 940157, "pages": "293", "keywords": ["brief accusation of sorcery then hardening"], "verbatim": "[Page 293\\]\n\nShe lived with him as man and wife, she had already told the landlady, and confided to the landlord: that she had already been in this state of grace for ten years.

She now advanced further, and said to the landlord, who complained of inner unrest and uncertainty on the new path: since he had begun so happily, she would not conceal from him that above all he must renounce baptism and the Christian Trinity, pride, vanity, and discord. For among them there existed an entirely different Trinity, which the father did not yet know; and when she had declared herself for this one in her night of birth, the angels of the Lord had appeared to her."}, "The Fall of Man and Divine Judgment": {"start_char": 1103940, "end_char": 1108721, "pages": "344-345", "keywords": ["the fall of man and divine judgment"], "verbatim": "Then, however, the office of the judge divides into a twofold: one conclusive, directed against the herd of the contagion, and one protective and preservative for those exposed to the contagion; which then leads us over to these, since it may not easily be accomplished without the clergy. For it has namely fallen to the theologians, above all, to instruct the judges and the physicians concerning the degree of influence that the demon can gain over human nature.\n\nWhat power does he possess by nature, what has he acquired for himself in addition, and on what can he, over against the Christian church, lay claim? These are questions whose discussion must precede every accusation of alliance with him. The first witchcraft trial is, after the first Fall, brought and decided before the judgment seat of God. The first-created tribal heads of the race had passed by the well of the water of life, and had drunk from the magic well. The dragon had beguiled them with cunning, and they had concluded the alliance of servitude with him.\n\nThe woman had first believed him: that, where she ate, she would become clairvoyant, and like the Elohim in discerning good and evil; powerful over both, and therefore by no means obligated to death. Thus, in eating at the table of the Sabbath of its fruit, she had committed an outrage against the Lord, and brought the husband to the same deed through partaking with her. Now God, the all-discerner, sits in judgment, and the inquisition begins. The accused are summoned; they are themselves the witnesses of their guilt, for since they have become clairvoyant, their fear and their shame must loudly proclaim that they have now taken evil into themselves. \\[Page 345\\]\n\nThe man shifts the blame onto the woman, this one onto the dragon; to him, as the first instigator, the judgment is therefore pronounced first of all. The curse strikes him amid all the animals; he shall not stand upright, but shall wallow on his belly and eat dust all the days of his life. To the bond that he has knotted with the woman, the enmity between his seed and hers shall set itself in opposition. The heel, the outermost part of the one, is given over to him; but she, in return, shall trample his innermost and highest. To the woman is imposed the toil and the pain of childbirth, and she is given into subjection to the man; to this one, however, a toilsome life on the earth made thorny for him, until he returns to her from whom he was taken.\n\nThus was the judgment held, as only God could hold it, with complete insight into the matter at hand; the punishments, however, not like ones casually alighting on the individual, but springing from the offense itself; hence also not confining themselves to the individual, but inhering in the whole race. It had wholly fallen prey to death, which was awarded in common to all the condemned; and indeed it was not merely the bodily death, but also the spiritual one that was consigned to it; namely, the fall and the reprobation, of which the former is only a sign full of meaning. After the times had run their course, a second judgment was held. Because to the seducing spirit, in a contemplative beholding of the present, there also belongs a will that is similarly firm, constant, and unchangeable; thus the fall and reprobation were irrevocably fixed for him. But because to the seduced ones, united in body and soul, there inhabits a discursive mode of thinking, and thus also a will that is mobile in like manner; therefore history was allotted to them for expiation, under favorable assistance. In its unfolding, the enmity set between the seed of the woman and the seed of the dragon worked its effect; the blood purified itself in the one race to the degree that it poisoned itself in the other; for this separation was the task of the ancient time.\n\nThe chosen people had therefore separated itself from the other peoples; in it, pride and hypocrisy again drove to the left, just as humility and piety tended to the right. With the latter stood God; the other side was the dragon's side; but they believed in him more than in God, because they took his illusory image for the image of God. When at last the opposites had come to their simplest expression, when on the one side God had hidden himself in the Incarnation, on the other the dragon had disguised himself in possession; then the hour of judgment had arrived. But this time it appeared as if not the true God were going to judge over the evil one and his followers, but the reverse; the evil one had summoned the tribunal, his followers sat on the judges' seats, and it seemed as though the reprobate were to pronounce judgment over the one who reproved.

Hell rejoiced; the gray bonds of the left had triumphed over the fellowship of the covenant on the right; the ancient prophecy had been brought to shame: for the seed of the dragon had crushed the head of the seed of the woman, since the slayer of the serpent had himself been entwined and slain by the serpent's own coils. Then the wonders of providence suddenly became manifest. Sin, brought forth through the misuse of freedom and stepping in between God and the creature, had also split soul and body apart within it, and thus carried death into them.\n\nThe restoration could only take place by God, through union with the creature preserved in the same temptation, casting out the divisive sin, and that creature now going with freedom into death, thereby atoning for and expelling the sin that had intruded between body and soul. The moment of death, which Hell in its judgment pronounced over the victim, was therefore the instant of its defeat; the wounded heel had only brought about the physical death, but the resurrection shattered the dragon's head; the prophecy was fulfilled, the spiritual death was averted for all who held to the Victor. But the act was also exemplary, enclosing within itself the whole history and its future; therefore in this resurrection was also prefigured the destruction of physical death at the end of the atoning history and the restoration of all things"}, "The Confessions of Trois Echelles": {"start_char": 1111233, "end_char": 1112781, "pages": "346-347", "keywords": ["- confessions of child killing"], "verbatim": "He no longer has the might to infect entire peoples, so that other peoples must be mustered against them to ward off the pestilence.

Here it was not the infamous criminals who testified mutually against one another; rather, it was the victims of their infamies who, through the manner in which they were struck by them, had come to clairvoyance in the realm of darkness; and now with sharpened eyes tracked down their enemies in their very hiding places.\n\nThis kind of witness-proof was not subject to the objection that made the previous one entirely unusable, and it seemed there was nothing substantial to object against it. We shall consult experience on this, and we choose an event that took place far away across seas, in a Protestant land, among entirely unprepared people. In the year 1602, in New England, in Salem and Dover and the region around Boston, a series of events occurred that cost many people their lives. Two years earlier, in the house of a resident there, Goodwin, a young girl, otherwise of good character, had fallen into obsession; Cotton Mather had taken her into his house and made a report about it known. She had stated that, when her paroxysm approached, someone brought her an invisible horse. She then jumped onto a chair, positioned herself in the posture of a rider, and began to kick and stamp and gallop. She spoke with invisible company that wandered about with her, and listened to their answers. After two or three minutes, she seemed to imagine that she was at a distant place with the witches at an assembly; after which she later, on her invisible horse, returned again, and soon thereafter came back to herself, and told all sorts of things about the Sabbath and the people who had been there.\n\nOne sees: it was a demonized somnambulist who had directed her intentions toward the Sabbath and executed them; Mather had experimented with her in various ways, and many eyewitnesses had be"}, "The Salem Witch Trials of 1692": {"start_char": 1131240, "end_char": 1146528, "pages": "352-356", "keywords": ["salem witch trials 1692", "witch trials"], "verbatim": "She then jumped onto a chair, positioned herself in the posture of a rider, and began to kick and stamp and gallop.

Now it happened that at the end of February 1692, various young persons belonging to the family of the preacher Parris in Salem, and still several others in the neighborhood, began to behave in a strange and unusual manner. They crawled into holes and under chairs and benches, made strange and distorted gestures, spoke wondrous things, and fell into paroxysms of various kinds.\n\nA day of fasting was held on their account, and now the thus afflicted named various persons who, as they said, hovered before their eyes in their paroxysms, and who were the ones inflicting the torments. An Indian woman in the house, who had previously baked a cake to discover the witches, was the most severely blamed; she was beaten and threatened, and now confessed that she was a witch, and that the Devil wanted to force her to sign a book which, according to other testimony, was red, of considerable thickness, and a cubit in length. Meanwhile the number of sufferers had risen to ten; but the number of the accused was far greater still. \\[Page 353\\]\n\nTestimony was given against one named Cory: that her spectral shape brought them a book to sign, and that she bit, pinched, and strangled them. In the examination she confessed that she had a yellow bird, and that a black man whispered something in her ear. A child of about five years was accused: that all were tormented upon whom it only cast its eyes; it bit the tormented ones in the process, who showed the marks of its little teeth on their arms. On April 11 there was a public examination before six magistrates and some clergymen. The afflicted complained against many, with terrible screaming and gnashing of teeth. Especially against one, Mistress Proctor, the screaming was most vehement; and when her husband came to assist her, screaming was raised against him as well. The afflicted usually fell down upon seeing the accused, and they were then made to recite the Lord's Prayer, and searches were also made for witch-marks, as one was believed to have been found on a certain Bishop.\n\nThe accused were always to sign the book, and then they would receive relief; one of them had allowed herself to be induced to sign through her pains, and her affliction had abated. But now she, the former afflicted one, became a tormentor; for her specter appeared to another person and pressed for a signing. One of those thus haunted by her once pointed to a spot where she stood; another who was present, though he saw no one, struck there with a rapier, and now the afflicted cried out: You have given her a thrust in the eye! The struck one soon confessed thereafter: that she had become a witch through the book, and now tormented the maid; but in the process had received two wounds, one in the eye, and a larger one on the side, of which the scar was found upon examination. On May 14, 1692, Sir William took over the government; the matter took a more serious turn, and the witches were put in irons; whereupon it was said that the afflicted felt better and were freed from their torment.\n\nA month later Bridget Bishop was executed, who always maintained her innocence. On July 19 five others followed her in death. Rebecca Nurse, one among them, had at first received a verdict of not guilty from the jury; at this, first all the accusers in the courtroom, and then all the afflicted except her, raised such a terrible screaming that all those present were horrified by it. The jury now assembled for more mature deliberation, the result of which was then guilty. All five defended their innocence to their last breath. On August 10 five more were executed, all of whom steadfastly denied their guilt.\n\nAmong them was a clergyman, Mr.\u00a0Burroughs, who delivered such a moving speech from the ladder, in testimony of his innocence, that many could not restrain their tears. But the accusers said: the black man dictated to him what he should say. John Willard was another of their number, who had earlier arrested many others; but because he became unwilling to seize ever more others, they cried out against him as well. He fled forty miles from Salem, but was recaptured, and those in the paroxysm knew exactly the time, and said: Now Willard is captured. \\[Page 354\\]\n\nIn September Giles Corey gave himself death, because he observed that the jury freed no one. Soon after that, when eight others were executed, the cart at the hill would not move properly; the afflicted said: the devil was holding it back. Captain Alden sat fifteen weeks in prison, and then escaped; likewise Philip English and his wife; their property was confiscated. In October some of the accusers, who boasted of seeing spirits, were summoned by J. Ballard to Andover, to tell him who was tormenting his wife. The people fell into convulsions after their fashion; then they named the persons whom they saw sitting at the head, and others at the feet of the afflicted.\n\nGradually more than fifty persons were also accused there. Some of those examined confessed their guilt, and added circumstances that authenticated their statements. They agreed therein with the accusations of the afflicted and with one another; they gave the time of their covenant with Satan, and their motives for it; they confessed how they had flown through the air on poles to the Sabbath, how they had mocked the sacraments there, and signed themselves into the book; and they even showed the wounds from which the blood had been taken for it.\n\nThey spoke therein of the toads that they had suckled, and showed the sores here as well; a turn of events that, as we have seen, is peculiar to the English school of witchcraft. The confusion grew ever greater; many elders believed their children were witches, many men held their wives to be such. The spirit-seers became more numerous, and they said: they saw the spirits of the murdered hovering over those who had killed them. Thus they spoke of Justice Bradstreet, who himself had committed thirty or forty suspects to prison, that he had murdered nine of them; he saved himself by flight. A dog was soon afflicted; the seers said: the brother of the fugitive was riding it. This one took flight, and the dog was killed. Another dog met the same fate, because they were seized by paroxysm when he looked at them.\n\nMeanwhile, among the accused were also many of the very best reputation, whose Christian disposition no one could doubt; and the number of the accused in general became so great that one could not imagine them all to be guilty. Also the protestations of the nineteen executed had had their effect. Thus one came to consider whether the whole thing might not be Satan's work, who thus deluded the afflicted? The clergy, at the request of the authorities, held a meeting, and here, among other things, the question was put to them: whether Satan could not appear both in the form of innocent and godly persons, as well as in that of guilty and godless ones, in order to deceive those whom he had afflicted? and they answered that he might do so. Now one began to reflect; to be sure, in January 1693 twenty-six were still examined, but only three were convicted, and none more executed. Soon the convicted obtained a reprieve; on April 25 one confessed himself guilty, and yet the jury pronounced him not guilty. \\[Page 355\\]\n\nAnd now, after the storm had lasted sixteen months, nineteen at the gallows, one voluntarily deceased, over fifty had confessed to witchcraft, over 150 still sat in the prisons, and more than 200 were yet under accusation; after the judges, like the best of the people, had been reviled, they finally desisted. The accused were set free in all the prisons, the fugitives returned, and peace was restored. With it now came the reactions as well. Since everything had proceeded from the house of the clergyman Parris, and he himself had been a strong zealot in the matter, many withdrew from his congregation and submitted a petition against him: that he had given credence to the accusations of the devil. He acknowledged his error, to be sure, but the accusers did not rest until he was removed.\n\nA day of fasting and repentance was proclaimed, to atone for the congregation. On it, one of the judges stood up in their midst and publicly confessed: that in the recently occurred events he might have erred in many points, and he humbly begged forgiveness. Six of the accused women, who had confessed their guilt, signed a document in which they, among other things, recounted: We were brought to the afflicted persons, who, as they said, fell into their paroxysms upon our arrival. Mr.\u00a0Barnard then prayed, and our hands were laid upon them, and the seized ones now said: it would become better for them again, and we were guilty of their torments; whereupon we were immediately seized and sent as prisoners to Salem.\n\nWe, however, who knew ourselves to be entirely innocent of all that, were exceedingly dismayed, astonished, and confused on account of the sudden assault; so that we almost lost our reason. Since our best friends, beholding us in such a state, believed there was no other means to save our lives, they persuaded us, out of love and pity, to confess that what those others said of us was true. But those were only confessions that were suggested to some of us by others, who said: we were witches, and they knew it, and we knew it likewise; and they knew that we knew it. Since we had now almost lost all understanding, all reason, and all mental faculties, we were not able to judge of our condition; and the most that we said was only an assent to what they chattered to us beforehand.\n\nWhen we were afterward a little composed again, and they told us what we had confessed; then we certainly said again that we were innocent, and that we knew nothing at all of such things. --- One cannot depict more touchingly and emphatically the state of mind of countless ones who stood in court in such accusations, nor more aptly portray how people, often without malice, impose their delusions upon one another. The twelve jurors likewise signed a document in which they declared: \"how they had not been able to comprehend or withstand the mysterious deceptions of the powers of darkness; and how they therefore feared, along with others, though unwittingly and unintentionally, to have loaded upon themselves and the congregation the guilt of blood.\n\nThey therefore pleaded with God that He would not impute this guilt to anyone; but all whom they had unjustly offended, they humbly begged forgiveness.\" That was now good and praiseworthy; but the executed were not thereby brought back to life. The entire narrative vividly illustrates how the good folk had entered the enchanted forest, and became all the more entangled in it the further they advanced. If we consider in this the view that was taken during the investigation: that the demon had caused the confusion; then one sees that he made use therein of two kinds of people as his instruments. \\[Page 356\\]\n\nThe first group consists of the afflicted: their actions were driven by malice, or at the very least, no suspicion had ever been cast upon them; they were clairvoyant, experienced their paroxysms, were struck down by them upon seeing the others, and their numbers grew through the ever-wider spread of the affliction.\n\nThe others were the tormentors. On their side the evil, probably with the Indian woman in the same house as Parris, had taken its beginning. Mather writes later, in his history of New England, the whole confusion to the Indian pawwaws or sorcerers, who had sent their spirits among the Europeans. That woman, who wandered about in the kitchen, formed according to him then the transition; and from her the evil passed in pursuit to the ever increasing number of the others. The allegedly acting and the suffering formed two rows; but in their midst stood deciding the red book in between. Who signed belonged to the first, who refused to the others; and if one of these decided upon the signature, he, like that woman, immediately entered the other row, and became spectral.\n\nThe evil also passes over to children, even spreads among the domestic animals; one of the two dogs places itself on the side of the afflicted, the other joins the tormentors. Now the question arises: Can one of the two rows give legally valid testimony against the other, without accusing itself? The left could only, if seriously repentant, direct its testimony against itself. The right, the afflicted, are possessed according to the presupposition; but there is no infallible sign by which one could distinguish the possession through immediate incursion of Satan from the obsession through mediation of a third. But if the first were the case, then the thus possessed could not testify against the others that they had obtained Satan through their mediation; these could rather with greater probability give testimony against them that they, the first-possessed, had transferred the devil onto them. But if even an obsession had taken place, two cases are possible.\n\nThe left had indeed sent Satan to the right; but this would have been received with conscious consent on the part of the possessed. The ones would then be possessed like the others, there would be only the difference of giving and taking, like that of incubus and succubus in possession; the movements in the neighborhood arose from the community of both, and one would have had the equal right to strike both dead, as was done to the two dogs.\n\nOr the taking possession happened without foreknowledge of the seized; then the accused could reply: You see the devil in you only in our shape, your faith is thus deception, and your testimony false. In all these cases therefore no reliance could be placed on these statements; all advantage was however on the side of the evil, in whose interest the two lines, as the third, that of the judges, worked. For what concerns the first, the more were arrested, the so much greater number became afflicted; and the attacked always complained of new ones who frightened them, and with the number of the confessing the multitude of the defamed increased without end; the judges however were drawn ever deeper into the blood-guilt.\n\nFirst the magnitude of the evil awakened the healthy understanding to counteraction, and the entanglement became now evident. The circumstance that the animals were drawn into complicity reveals: that a demonic disease in two forms here raged; and it is from what lies before us not to be ascertained how the relation of guilt to misfortune in that evil"}, "The Water Ordeal of Five Suspects in the Seine, 1696": {"start_char": 1152788, "end_char": 1153831, "pages": "359", "keywords": ["the water ordeal of five suspects in the seine 1696"], "verbatim": "If they were guilty, they floated; whereas sinking was supposed to indicate their innocence.

The Good and Secure Practice\n\nThere is no lack, neither in ecclesiastical nor in secular courts, of examples of the most blameless administration of justice in such cases. We select from them only one, the case of del Vaulx in Stablo, because of its rounded completeness, and because the judge himself recounts it from the records. Chapeauville, canon in Li\u00e8ge, reports the following about this legal proceeding. In the year 1595, Johannes del Vaulx, a member of the old and famous monastery of Stablo, had been imprisoned by his prior on suspicion of poisoning and other crimes; which, when it came to the knowledge of the abbot and administrator of the monastery, prompted him to send me there.\n\nI saw the man, who by God's grace had grown weary of the demon's tyranny, and who, in the first conversation with me and the prior, opened up his entire life to us with many tears. For when he had tended the herds of his elders, and his boyhood had already been stained with abominable crimes, after his fifteenth year had arrived, he had seen an old man in long and seemingly clerical garb walking through the forest, who asked him: whether he would serve him and obey him? He would, as a reward, bring him to high honors in the state that he himself chose, to which he had then boldly agreed at once. \\[Page 363\\]\n\nAfterwards, he appeared to him in other and ever other monstrous forms, and also pressed into his shoulders two marks, which we examined; then carried him to the nocturnal assemblies, over many places, and provided him with poisons, with which he killed the cattle of the elders and of others, and also, in addition, human beings; and then accompanied him on his studies to Trier. On his advice, he then took the habit and immediately the orders of the priesthood; and removed the prior along with other order clerics, in order to gain the priory, by poison. But he had still many participants in his crimes and malefactions.\n\nWhen I reported this to the prelate, he resolved: to have the case judged in the legal manner. He therefore sent the reverend Mr.\u00a0A. Stregnart, suffragan, and me with a notary once more to Stablo; we interrogated him on all individual articles, and recorded his statements in writing. Since we noticed during the interrogation that the demon had taught him many pagan and heretical errors; we instructed him in the doctrine of the one and triune God, of the good and evil spirits, of immortality, of the future life, as well as in some other fundamental doctrines of our faith. The prelate wanted: that a thorough examination be conducted with him, so that, if he were brought to true repentance and stood by his statements --- but he accused more than 500 accomplices ---, these testimonies might have all the greater credence.\n\nAfter weighing the confession and the accusations made, the prelate dispatched a commission to his principality of Stablo; whereby he transferred to his suffragan A. Stregnart, to me his general vicar, then to Father Oranus, pro-chancellor of his council and assessor of Li\u00e8ge, as well as to Mr.\u00a0Molempeter, advocate of the fisc, all authority: to judge over the whole matter, to pass sentence, to execute the judgment; and if necessary, to call in the ordinary and feudal judges, knowledgeable in the laws and customs. In consequence thereof, we set out at the beginning of 1500 for Stablo, in a carriage which broke in two in the middle on the way; so that we had to cover the rest of the journey on horseback. We arrived still in the evening at the monastery, and visited the prisoner, who, upon our greeting, without returning it, at once brought forward excuses regarding the incident with the broken wagon.\n\nNot his demon, he said, who had never done him any harm, had caused it; but another evil-minded one had committed it. At the break of the following day, he was examined and interrogated on the articles fixed by the fisc, and he persisted steadfastly in his first confession, not only naming his accomplices, but also specifying precisely: to which sodality they belonged; whither he had been nocturnally abducted with them; what criminal acts had been practiced there, what had been done in honor of the presiding demon; in what order the banquets had been held, the minglings had taken place, and the enchantments of humans, cattle, and fruits had been performed. \\[Page 364\\]\n\nThe names, status, and circumstances of the accused persons were thereby determined with the utmost precision. But we, in order to test the consistency of his words, and to close the mouth of slander, waited some days before visiting him again; then reminded him of his salvation, and warned him that on this account he should beware of falsely accusing anyone. Thereupon we read to him his statements and accusations again, but in reverse and confused order; so that we placed those whom he had put in the first row, say, under the second and third, and vice versa. But he then insisted: that he had not said so, that the words had not been correctly recorded; that the matters stood thus, whereupon he repeated his earlier statements in their order.\n\nWe held it thus more often, for he had accused both clergy and laymen. Thus he said: that he had often visited the Trier assembly, where D. Vlaet, electoral councilor, who was burned there as a sorcerer, had presided; and that he had also had at this place a beautiful and charming girl, a fisherwoman, as his beloved, who after every assembly presented him with fish. After we had heard all this most wondrous from him, we nevertheless interrogated him still more often in formal sessions, treating him mildly and inquiring of him in every way the truth about his life and his deeds; but we found him in all things so steadfast and consistent with himself that we dismissed all suspicion of madness in his mind.\n\nOranus, who now, as I write this (1616), lives at 76 years of age in great vigor, and I myself, we visited him out of Christian love moreover still often in the room wherein he lived; we questioned him often about everything that we had learned in part from writings, in part from his confessions. But he always adduced weighty reasons that proved that what he had confessed had not occurred through deceitful demonic impressions, merely in the imagination, as we suggested and as it seemed probable to us; but rather truly, really, hypostatically and personally encountered him, and he indicated certain signs by which he could recognize when he had actually attended the assemblies and committed this or that, and when merely in the imagination.\n\nWhen we had communicated the records to the prelate, and he recognized more and more the importance of the matter, he commanded us: to open the instruction of the process against the accused, both clergy and laymen; which then throughout the course of this year, up to the tenth of January of the following, was done with equal diligence and equal attention. It had been impressed upon us: not merely to lay hands on old women and men from the common folk, but also against the notables of the place, the mayor named Kannerlink, the judges and the pastor, as well as some religious persons distinguished by age, spirit, learning, and judgment. On the 10th of January 1597, after an advocate and syndicus had been assigned to the prisoner, the articles of accusation of the fiscal were read to him before the assembled court, along with the responses that he had made and maintained thereto thereafter; whereupon he clearly, frankly, and persistently declared and confessed: that he could make no change in the admitted sorceries, nor in the accused persons, or render any retraction, without placing the salvation of his soul in danger. \\[Page 365\\]\n\nSince the fiscal now urgently pressed for the pronouncement of judgment against the confessing accused, the terms set for the verdict were prorogued nine times on account of the importance of the matter; and just as often the guilty one was reminded of the peril of his previous life under the dominion of the devil, and how he had mocked the almighty God, his service, and his religion; he should therefore take care not to rob himself of all hope of salvation through empty and fabricated confessions, or false and slanderous accusations. He said again and repeated himself ever: that he could change nothing in what he had previously confessed, or retract anything whatsoever without lying and perjury. He hoped only for a merciful judgment; and that was his sole, fervent desire, that after renouncing the devil, reconciled once more to the almighty and merciful God, he might obtain his grace. The syndicus, dissatisfied with this, demanded that the clergy of Stablo, who, infected by the poison and still lying sick, be interrogated thereon. Aegidius Harsetanus, the prior, Mauritius of Offl, Quirin of Generet, Cornelius Neufforge, and Paschasius Lymburg were thereupon examined, all of whom testified: how they indeed considered themselves harmed by the poison that their fellow brother Del Baulr, or his companions, had placed in various places in the monastery.\n\nThe syndic now proposed: to proceed according to the records, and to condemn the guilty to be interrogated under torture; so that the confession regarding his accomplices might thereby be proven, and gain greater evidentiary force. This exhortation was made in the presence of the accused, who merely implored the mercy of the Almighty God. Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted: In the matter of J. Vilars, syndic of the Abbey of Stablo, plaintiff, against H. J. Del Vaulr, a member of that monastery, accused of sorcery, which matter remains pending before us, J. Chapeauville, commissioner specially appointed by His Highness; upon the counsel of those learned in divine and human law, to whom the state of the case has been communicated, it is resolved and pronounced: The aforesaid accused shall, before proceeding to the full resolution of his case, be rigorously questioned, and further interrogated under torture. Given on the 19th of March 1597.\n\nWhen this decree became known, amid the bitterness of many of those accused of sorcery, the rumor spread: that we had been dealing with a deranged and senseless man. In order to dispel this rumor, we summoned the lords Ludwig von Viset, prior of Malmedy, a man of proven and tested truthfulness; Hubert von Verlemont; Gabriel Neufforge, steward of Stablo; Remigius Ultrapontanus; Wilhelm Rane, podest\u00e0 of Malmedy; Adolph von Rahier, the schultheiss of Bodeur; P. von Noirfalli, schultheiss of Chenron; as well as other clerics, noble and esteemed men, officials and magistrates, among whom some were also suspected of sorcery. In their collective presence, J. Del Vaulr was now repeatedly questioned anew regarding the confessions and accusations. He always responded undauntedly, steadfastly, and aptly to everything put before him; so that he corrected all the errors and perverse narratives that we had intentionally fabricated, as well as the objections of the suspects, who made them vehemently against him; and, providing good reasons from all sides, he entirely refuted the opinion of his mental derangement.\n\nYet with this, his adversaries were still not pacified, but rather spread about: how, during the time of his imprisonment, he had written letters to the lords de la Bourlotte and de Goberville, as well as to D. de Wils, in which matters were contained that pointed to madness: in that he called them his nephews; and therein promised to do away with all enemies of the Catholic king through his arts and his secrets, and more of the like. \\[Page 366\\]\n\nWhen earnestly questioned, he replied firmly and calmly: that at that time he had played the fool and the delirious, pretending kinship, and spoken of the fall of the king's enemies, so that he might be released from prison on the grounds of madness; on this statement he persisted during three and four interrogations. After all this was concluded in judicial and customary manner, he said, when the acts were repeated from the beginning and translated into the language of the country for those ignorant of Latin, repeatedly: all confessions and accusations written down here are entirely true; and everything he stated therein about persons was truly done and committed. Then he was confronted with J. von Frounille, the pastor of Stablo, whom he accused of sorcery. When D. Oran, extremely experienced in these legal matters, wondered at the categorical denials of the pastor, Del Vaulr removed all his wonder in my presence by explaining to him the secret of silence among sorcerers. A solemn oath is repeated annually over this in all gatherings, and it had not long been taken in that of Stablo; at which he had been present and had recognized the said Frounille very well.\n\nNow the syndic of the court demanded: that all his statements and references, and the confessions of the accused, be read out again, and then the latter, under invocation of God, be questioned on oath and under threat of eternal damnation: whether he persists in his oft-repeated confession, or has anything contrary to testify. The accused, after the punishment for perjury had been solemnly explained to him, answered firmly: all his confessions and accusations are entirely true, and he can and will retract nothing of them. With this testimony the syndic would not be satisfied, but now moved for the application of the rack, not to elicit further confession, but to confirm the one already given; so that the guilty of the crime might have no cause to complain. The accused, when all his testimony was read out to him again, insisted upon it, calling God to witness under oath.\n\nProceedings now advanced to the rack; the accused testified under torture, as the articles of the fiscal were presented to him one by one, at peril of his salvation and damnation: that all and every one he had named had been accomplices in the sorcery; that he had seen and recognized them in the assemblies, and had committed and carried out with them everything he had stated. Earnestly reminded again to consider maturely all that he had said and confessed, and to accuse no one guiltlessly; after prayers and exorcisms had also not been omitted over him, he confessed openly and firmly: everything said and confessed is the pure truth, and no one is slandered or unjustly accused; this he testified on the mercy of God Almighty, to which he, after revoking the vows made to the demon, betook his refuge, and awaited forgiveness for his poor soul, which had hitherto been in a state of despair. Finally, the improbability of so great a number of accomplices and confederates was set before him; which we did to test his reliability, but he nonetheless stood by his word. After common prayers and new exorcisms, he was again urged to say nothing against the truth; under repetition of the solemn oath he remained by his testimonies and accusations, and avowed: that he would hold to them until the end of his life. \\[Page 367\\]\n\nAfter all those present had unanimously reminded him once more of the consequences of perjury and the dangers of false accusation, and he had sworn for the second and third time that he had said nothing against the accused persons except what he himself had seen and heard; he was released from the torture and led to the hearth, unharmed in his limbs, for the torture had been only mild. We had also seen the marks on his shoulders at that time, and tested them with a needle, which we drove deep into them without his feeling any pain from it. Since all this had now thus taken place, the fiscal requested a legally valid transcript of what had occurred, and declared, after receiving it, that he would and must make use of it not only against the accused but also against every other person, as testimony and foundation for every investigation. He further moved that the defendant be summoned for the seventh hour of the second of April, in order to hear his judgment in proper form from the mouth of the commissioner and judge D. \\[something\\] v. Chapeauville. The notification of this summons was thereupon attested by Henricus Harsetanus, the cleric, with his own handwritten signature.\n\nThe judgment read as follows:\n\nWhereas thou, F. Del Baulr, priest and abbot in Stablo, art convicted not only by many reports, witness testimonies, and public rumor, but also by thy oft-repeated confession, of having denied the faith and religion to which thou didst profess thyself at baptism, not merely with thy mouth but also in thy heart and soul, and in opposition thereto of having dedicated thyself to the demon, the enemy of the human race; whereas thou hast worshipped him at the nocturnal assemblies repeatedly; hast also concluded a pact and vow with him in order to commit maleficia, to obtain honors, pleasures, riches, and other earthly goods besides; and, to confirm the pact, hast obtained his marks on thy shoulders; whereas thou hast caused the death of several fellows of the abbey of Stablo, namely the lords Antonius von Salm, the prior of this monastery, Perpetuus, Aegidius Warsegnius, Anton Harsetanus, Heinrich de Rahier, Leonard Fronduille, Corbelius Neufforge, and others of the lay estate, namely Nicolaa, the widow left behind of Heinrich von Houfalize, the wife of the foreman of the same place, and J. v. Morimon, citizen of Stablo, by means of poison which the demon gave thee; and furthermore hast committed many other abominable crimes with demonic succubi, as well as with married and unmarried women; for which thou deserves not only to be deposed from all offices and degrees, but truly degraded and handed over to the secular arm, according to the ordinance of the holy canons.\n\nWe, therefore, in order that such crimes, under the pretext of thy priestly order and monastic vows, may not remain unpunished, but that thou in this life shalt undergo a punishment to some satisfaction for thy sins and vices, for the reparation of the scandal, as an example and terror to the wicked, and for the edification of the pious: do hereby decree by this our final judgment that thou be stripped of all office and every dignity, declared worthy of actual deposition, and handed over to the secular arm; as we now in fact do strip thee of thy offices and dignities, degrade thee, and hand thee over to the secular arm; while however beseeching the judges and officers of the secular jurisdiction that they, insofar as the law permits, may abstain from bloodshed.\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\nGiven on the 2nd of April 150; in the morning at 8 o'clock. \\[Page 368\\]\n\nAfter the reading of this judgment, the degraded and stripped of his dignity was handed over to Prochancellor Oranus and Fiscal Advocate Molempeter, whom the most worthy Suffragan had appointed for this purpose; who now, with the involvement of some notables, wise assessors, and honored persons, after reviewing and carefully weighing the records, decided: J. Del Baulr should be executed with the sword, but then buried in consecrated ground in the churchyard of the monastery. The reason for the mitigated punishment was: because he had been in a state of accusation for five years, and during this time had been confined in a dark dungeon, living on bread and water; and what is more, had proven through his tears and sighs that he felt remorse over the past.\n\nWhen his judgment was read to him, as he knelt dissolving in tears, he thanked them for the mitigated punishment; and asked the Prior that the ration, which according to custom was distributed to the poor for forty days after the death of every m"}, "The Clairvoyant Visions of Del Vaulr": {"start_char": 1189109, "end_char": 1197553, "pages": "369-371", "keywords": ["- and execution of del vaulx"], "verbatim": "ocedures. Del Vaulr had gazed into the distance, and seen the accident with the approaching judges' carriage, and communicated his vision, before anyone informed him of what had occurred. He was thus clairvoyant, all his statements therefore rested on visions that had come to him; whereas what he reported about the state of his own inner being referred predominantly to clear, lucid intuitions. His soberly reflecting self stood in an entirely different relation to his mystically beholding self than the latter did to the equated spheres of other personalities; and the inner spiritual activities followed entirely different laws in their effects.\n\nHad the visions all been realities, then to be sure these differences would have balanced out again in the general lawfulness of nature, and the unity of the whole human being would have absorbed the differences within itself. He himself regarded them as a rule to be real, and in translating them into the language of ordinary life had noted certain signs by which he believed he could distinguish the truly real from those that were only apparently so. But these signs were not infallible, not even for him himself; as Oran related to his friend and Delrio: he was nevertheless sometimes uncertain whether everything had not altogether merely transpired in the vision.\n\nThus in this daemonic vision, with the conviction of its ideality or reality, it is precisely the same as in the higher mystical one regarding the insight into its relation to truth and deception; whose uncertainty we learn from Maria of Agreda, who despite the long years of apprenticeship and the most earnest discipline in which she held herself on the path of her progress, yet sometimes became doubtful whether deception had not beset her. If in this kind of visions nothing at all blameworthy has shown itself, if all signs have declared themselves for their authenticity; if they have been indubitably accompanied by the infused higher light that awakens and sharpens the inner higher instinct, the discerning spiritual conscience, so that it separates deception from truth with all certainty; then, as we have seen above, the Church gives its assent: in such a way, however, that it holds the seer himself obligated to ascribe belief to the content of his vision, according to the measure of his conviction; but by no means compels others to the same agreement, as it demands such for its doctrines, but rather recommends them only as credible, as subsidiary support of the faith, for acceptance; leaving the measure of assent to each, and only rejecting unconditional repudiation. Should it now be otherwise with the daemonic vision? Del Vaulr had, with all the certainty that can enter in this domain, the conviction of the reality and truth of his own; and the court had to allow this conviction to stand, insofar as it concerned himself. \\[Page 370\\]\n\nBut otherwise it was constituted with regard to that part of them in which other actual human beings were drawn into the circle that she enclosed. Here his conviction, against the denial of these people, could not make itself valid; because they were not obliged to accept his visions as infallible truths. The court, therefore, could grant to the accusations from this source---however well they might be judicially confirmed---no other validity, especially in questions where life and death were at stake, than a mere subsidiary one, which could indeed support an accusation but by no means establish it. In truth, what are visions other than beholdings into the interior of things, which now represent themselves symbolically; because the hitherto seen exterior is now only a shell and expression for the newly attained and emerging interior. One could easily imagine that a magnetic somnambulist might have the visions of summer and of winter.\n\nThe center of the first would be the sun at the summer solstice. From this center she would see the streams of light and those of warmth descending toward the earth; these would set the electric currents in motion in her vicinity, which, now conjoined with the propelling ones, would quicken the three lower elements---air, water, and earth---so that they in turn would awaken the hidden germs of life, which now would burst forth at all the nodal points of the earth. As all those outer movements now arouse corresponding inner ones, and unfold themselves in the now flowing streams, the earth would then cover itself with green before her eyes, and in the midst of the thus unfolding vegetation the animal kingdom too would soon develop itself to her, each according to its time.\n\nThat would be a wild swelling, flowing, surging, waving, weaving, flaming and blazing and radiant life; to behold it from its outermost extension to the innermost fountainhead in closest proximity, but in all its members, all plant and animal genera, all natural forces and faculties, expressed only in symbols. The center of the second vision would be the winter pole of the earth, which, in the remoteness of the sun, has selfishly enclosed itself. From this center the binding, congealing forces of darkness and cold would take their origin; they would, if dealing with freedom, murderously destroy all animal and plant extensions down to their germs, and then, burying these germs in the congealed earth, frost them over with rime, pelt them with hail, and cover them with snow; even the element of air would, wingless and bound, lay itself down around the rigid waters for winter's sleep: for everywhere the magnetic force would only rule, and the ancient night would at last enclose everything in her gloom.\n\nThe one would be the summer dream of life of the earth, summed up in one intuition; the other her stony and iron winter sleep, felt in the innermost root of death. To these natural visions there must correspond two others, beheld in the interior of the spiritual realm. For the seer might behold the daylight side of humanity in general, or of a society friendly to him in particular, that is turned toward the sun of eternity, how it, connected with this its center, receives into itself its vivifying effluences; how the forces and faculties, touched by them, according to their orders and hierarchies, become ensouled and exalted in the warming ray, flowing: so that all spiritual pulses beat more strongly, all energies tense themselves more powerfully, all virtues, purified and transfigured, express themselves in their effects with joyfulness. That would be the vision of a superterrestrial Sabbath, held on the bright heights of the earth, and bringing before intuition the inner connection of all good on earth, and its deepest origin from the primal source of all blessing. \\[Page 371\\]\n\nWhat, then, can the vision of the Sabbath mean, which is held upon the midnight-dark heights, other than a sight of the inner spiritual intercourse that exists between the night-side of the conjoined ones and the root-like evil, which through its influences demonizes all the forces of this side; so that, while all the self-willed passions of the most radical ones are bound together, these operate in every one through the power of all. That such a connection exists, given the continuity that prevails through all realms of being, is beyond doubt; here only what hides itself in invisibility in ordinary life is brought to light for contemplation; so that the entire web of attracting and repelling forces comes to the fore.\n\nThe form of the entire vision is also here a symbolic one; all vices appear, according to their kinds and species, in great images; all their connecting threads with the heart, which beats in them all, are concrete, demonic personalities; all the accessories have their own peculiar significance, and the inversion of all the distorted, mirror-reflecting forms is the ruling law. The interpretation of these symbols is, like that of the images in the second vision, a matter that demands great insight and experience. That the crimes which appear in the vision have concretely and really taken place is by no means a necessary condition: for just as the seer himself throughout appears personally withdrawn from the realm of action; so too do his images throughout express only in a general manner how the orders to which this or that person belongs, in their present disposition and position, find themselves driven to act in relation to the conditioning world-powers, and under ce"}, "The Arras Waldensian Witch Trials": {"start_char": 1198704, "end_char": 1237670, "pages": "372-383", "keywords": ["salem witch trials 1692", "witch trials"], "verbatim": "and without love, written down from the events of the day on the spot. In the city of Langres, in Burgundy, Robinet de Baulx from Artois, who had passed himself off as a hermit, had expiated the charges against him with death by fire, and his statements had run as follows: many men and women were his companions in the Waldensianism, the local name at that time for heretical being. Among others, he had accused a prostitute from Douai named Deniselle, and J. la Vitte, called Abb\u00e9 de Pessens, thereof. The inquisitor in Arras, Peter le Brousart, had learned of this, and first had Deniselle arrested, and then also la Vitte, after he had learned of his residence in Abbeville, and had them locked up in the episcopal prisons. \\[Page 372\\]\n\nThe vicars of the bishop, P. du Hamel, J. Thieubault, J. Pochon, and M. du Hamel, to whom J. du Bois also joined himself, had interrogated the first one several times on the rack; where she then confessed her participation, as well as that she had seen the others take part. This one, while arrested, had attempted to cut out his tongue, but it had not succeeded for him; however, he was laid on the rack, even though at first he could not speak, where he then had to write down his confessions. He testified again against others whom he had seen at the Sabbath: two men and four women, among whom again three joy-girls. These were immediately arrested; but since the matter, through the multitude of the accused, seemed to be spreading far and wide, most of the investigators were of the opinion to give it no further pursuit and to release the prisoners.\n\nBut Master J. du Bois, dean of Our Lady in Arras, opposed this proposal, and the suffragan of the bishop, Brother Johann, joined his view. They went to the Count of Estampes at Peronne, who immediately came over to Arras and commanded the vicars to do their duty; otherwise they would have to answer to him for the consequences. Accordingly, the arrested ones were now again laid on the rack and otherwise questioned, and their confessions were sent by the vicars to Cambrai; where the doctor of theology, Gilles Carlier, a seventy-year-old man, one of the most eminent clerics of the Christendom of that time, as dean of the main church, as well as M. Nicolai as canon, resided; these were consulted for their advice in this matter. Their opinion is said to have been that, if the arrested ones recanted, they should not be subjected to the death penalty the first time; unless they had committed murders or abused the body of our Lord.\n\nBut Master Johann and the dean du Bois were of the opinion: All who had taken part in the Waldensian rite must die the death; also all who would be accused by them, if, in case of their not confessing, they were convicted by rack or in other ways, with witnesses. They gave themselves all effort to make this their opinion prevail, and I have heard the dean himself say: the third part and more of Christendom is infected by the Waldensians: he knows much of it, which he cannot say, and if he were permitted to speak it out, one would be horrified by it. All who had been accused thereon were real participants, and those who were not could not be accused. If objections were made against this view, whether by clerics or laymen, those who did so were called: such must be immediately taken into custody as suspected of Waldensianism. \\[Page 373\\]\n\nThe same also said: if it came to pass that some of the guilty were led to the stake, then it was not to be doubted how the devil would tempt them to that, that in the hour of death they would retract everything they had confessed and admitted, so that they would immediately be damned to hell. In all this he was supported by M. Jehan, bishop of Varut, who had been grand penitentiary in Rome in the year 1450; for which reason one also believed that much had become known to him. He also had such an imagination that, if he only looked at people, he judged and declared whether they had been in the Waldensians or not. For this reason he also held: bishops and even cardinals had been in it; and there were so many of them that, if they could draw a king or eminent prince into their interest, they would be powerful enough to rise up against those who did not belong to theirs, and to do them all injury and shame.\n\nBoth said also: as soon as anyone should be accused of this crime, no one might take his part; no one, be it father, mother, brother, sister, or whatever relative, under penalty of being himself regarded as an accomplice; moreover, those belonging to the Waldenses, if they learned of their accusation, might not escape the investigation by flight. Accordingly, they arrested yet another new accused person, and had the vicars once more admonished by the Count of Estampes to hasten the process. The vicars therefore assembled all the esteemed clergy of the city, together with the most skilled advocates, laid before them the records with all the depositions from the seven accused, and then proceeded, after the assembly had been heard on the matter, to the execution.\n\nAll the condemned were brought to the scaffold, save one who had hanged himself in the dungeon, and the mitre with the figure of the devil was placed upon them; Father le Brousart delivered a sermon to the kneeling ones, and thereupon set forth to them what they had done and perpetrated. They had, he said, anointed a very slender rod and the palm of the hand with the ointment, and had then flown over cities and forests to their meeting place. There they had found richly laden tables, there the demon in the form of a goat, a dog, a monkey, sometimes a man; they had worshipped him, and dedicated to him either their soul or a part of their body; and with burning lights in their hands, had kissed his behind. They had immediately spat upon the crucifix and trodden upon it, and the abb\u00e9 de la Biche had been the guide of all the newly received.\n\nThey had at the same time pointed their behinds at the heavens and the firmament, in mockery of God. And after they had eaten and drunk their fill, carnal mingling had followed, in which the demon had taken part in the form of man and woman: sodomy and bestiality and all the stinking vices that the speaker would not name had been committed therein. Toads, fed with the consecrated host, then burned, mixed with the bone-ash of hanged men, moistened with the blood of children, and compounded with herbs and other things by the abb\u00e9, had formed the ointment. The Church had been forbidden to them; they had been permitted to take holy water only with the words: May it not displease our master! \\[Page 374\\]\n\nThe demon preached to them: there is no other life than the present one; for they have no soul. After he had thus reproached them and more, he asked each one in turn whether all this had not indeed come to pass so? All, even the abb\u00e9, affirmed it. Thereupon they were severed from the Church as infected members, and handed over to the secular court; and their property was confiscated for the sovereign, their movable goods however for the bishop. The four women were sentenced to death by fire in Arras; but when they heard the sentence, they cried out like desperate ones to Master Gilles Flameng, who was just then present: Ha, false traitor! thou toldest us we should only confess what was dictated to us; we should then be let go, and have no other penance to perform than perhaps a pilgrimage six or twelve hours distant.\n\nThou knowest, abominable one! that thou hast deceived us. They said moreover: they had never been in the Waldensian sect; what they had confessed had been extorted from them by torture, or lured from them by the promises of that M. Gilles and others, and much more besides. But that availed them nothing; they were led to the stake. They prepared themselves Christianly for death, but maintained to their last breath that they knew not what the Waldenses were; which words gave the people much to think and talk about. The same happened with the demoiselle in Douay, where she was executed.\n\nEven the abbot of Depuysens held the same speeches, and said: he died without guilt; but his last words were: *Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat*. He was 60--70 years old, was a painter, well regarded in many places because he was a singer and a poet. He had also composed ballads in honor of the most holy Virgin, and thus had become valuable to many. But whenever he had sung a holy song, he had always doffed his little cap at the end and said: With the permission of my Lord. Some had attested to this; I do not know what there was to it. Six men, among them Knight Robert le Fosne, governor of Arras, and seven women, among whom again several joy-girls, were immediately arrested in Arras. But the matter now soon spread elsewhere as well.\n\nIn Amiens, on the basis of the statements in Arras, several were likewise taken into custody; but the bishop let them go, and said: he would do the same with all of them; for he did not believe that they did or could do what they said. In Tournai, likewise, 3--4 persons had been locked up; Master Jehan Taincture, doctor of theology, wrote on this occasion a good treatise on the Waldensians, which I, however, have not seen. The prisoners were released after some imprisonment. In Arras, meanwhile, proceedings had continued; two of the richest men of the city had had to wander into the bishop's prisons; finally, Payen de Beaufort, a noble knight, one of the old bannerets of Artois, about 72 years old, was also seized. He had been warned earlier, but he had answered: and even if he were a thousand leagues away, he would come to answer for himself; he feared nothing on that account. \\[Page 375\\]\n\nHe had come to Arras; his kin had adjured him, if he knew himself guilty, to withdraw. But he had sworn the most solemn oath, and consigned his soul to damnation if he knew what Waldensianism was, and had taken part in it. Yet he was arrested on that same day, and wished to be led to the Count of Estampes; but the latter refused to hear him, and had him taken to the episcopal prisons. Jacques Guillemeau, his brother-in-law, who was accustomed to heal fevers with incantations, when he visited him there, was likewise detained as an accused. Meanwhile, the trial of three men and double that number of women had been completed; on the scaffold their deeds were likewise recounted to them, which this time consisted in practiced lust with the demon.\n\nAll questioned, they confessed the truth of these accusations, except for one of the women, who denied everything. Two, who had steadfastly persisted in their initial confession without wavering, were sentenced to imprisonment; all the others, led to the stake, died---as much as one could see---in Christian composure, but persistently denying all participation. Again, A. Sacquesp\u00e9e, one of the richest citizens and aldermen of Arras, and two others were brought in. Martin Cornille, receiver of the county, and Willaume Le Febvre, a rich man, fled, and were pursued by the count as far as Paris. M. Anton had earlier replied to the urging of his friends to flee in the same way as the knight of Beaufort. The count, for the interrogation of the new prisoners, had further strengthened the commission by adding new members; among them was Philipp H. von Savinses, a strict man in these matters; also the Duke of Burgundy had attached his confessor, the Bishop of Salins, an eighty-year-old man, and Baldwin, knight of Nogent-l\u00e8s, governor of P\u00e9ronne. Two others were now taken into custody, and Arras thereby became so notorious in all of France and elsewhere that the merchants lost their credit, and no one would receive travelers from there in the inns.\n\nNo person dared to leave the city either, out of fear of being seized as a Waldensian; indeed, the people, as soon as anyone so much as stirred, immediately accused him of Waldensianism. The Vicars therefore made it known: no one should have fear, for no one would be arrested who had not been seen by 8--10 witnesses; although it was later learned that it had indeed happened on the testimony of 2--3. The Vicars now invited the fugitives to present themselves in person and to give account and answer to the charges laid against them.\n\nThereupon appeared Wilhelm Le Febore, the son of one of them, with a notary from Paris, early in the morning before Jean Pochon, one of the same, in the church, and appealed against them in the name of his father. After the protestation had been made, both mounted up and rode to Paris; where his father surrendered himself into custody in order to answer the charges of the Vicars. But they were overtaken by the men of the Vicars and brought into custody; a fate that many of their friends shared with them, those who had known of their intention. They were first released only after they had renounced their appeal, but the fugitives were excommunicated as Waldensians.\n\nMessengers had been sent to Amiens for more clerics and their counsel on behalf of the Lord of Beaufort and Master Anton; but no one came except Master Martin and the Inquisitor of Tournay; the others excused themselves on account of their age and other circumstances. \\[Page 376\\]\n\nBut it was said: the matter, hitherto unheard of, seemed to them grave and weighty; for out of 100 people, in and outside Arras, not one, it was said, believed that the accused had taken part in the Waldensian rites and actually carried out what they had confessed. The Vicars therefore turned, in accordance with the request of the prisoners, to Philip, Duke of Burgundy, in Brussels, for counsel on what they should do in the matter. He summoned from the University of Louvain the most eminent and renowned teachers, as well as from all over the land.\n\nTo them were laid out the processes of both those who had confessed and those who had not; for there were some who did not confess, no matter what was done to them. What they judged, I have not seen; but it was said: they had been very much at odds. Some had opined: the Waldensian rites were not real; others had held them to be a pure illusion, and judged that the people believed they were doing what they did not in fact accomplish. Others said in turn: it was all reality; they entered into it body and soul, and whoever once surrendered himself to the enemy permitted him all power over himself.\n\nThe Vicars now took their leave of the Duke, who gave them with him Toison d'Or, his chief herald, in whom he placed all his trust, to be present at the interrogations. For although those from Paris and elsewhere said: he was having the rich people arrested in order to seize their possessions; he nevertheless wanted to know exactly what the truth of the matter was, in order to decree what was necessary.\n\nOn 14 August 1460 they returned to Arras; and whatever the counsel of the legal experts may have been, from that time on no one was arrested any longer on the charge of Waldensianism, although countless people were still accused; the prisoners were also treated better, and up to September only 4 processes were decided, and laid before the Duke and his legal experts in Brussels.\n\nIn the meantime, papal bulls, procured through the fugitive Martin Cornille, were brought in; by which Pope Pius transferred to the Dean Carlier of Cambrai, Gregory Nicolat, canon and official there, and the two Vicars of Arras, Pierre du Hamel and Master Jehan Thienbaut, the right to pass judgment in such matters.\n\nAbout that time in Mantes, Noel Ferre from Amiens was burned, who had testified much against those of Arras; and how he had been at the assembly where the burning of the town of Pernes had been resolved.\n\nOn 12 October the delegates from Brussels returned, with them Master Adrian Collin, president of the chamber of the Duke of Burgundy in Douai; before whom the prisoners were interrogated once more.\n\nThe vicars now assembled many clerics and laymen, laid the records before them, and on the following day pronounced the judgment over Beauffort, Tacquet, Cariens, and Aubry. Before an innumerable crowd that had gathered from a radius of ten hours' journey, the accused appeared with the mitre on the scaffold. The Inquisitor of Cambrai now first charged Beauffort: how he, persuaded by evil women from the fellowship, had himself carried on the anointed staff to the Waldensians; how he had paid homage to the demon there, but instead of his soul had given him only four hairs from his head; how he had then kissed the paw of the ape, and recognized an unnamed woman. He had been twice more in the assembly, and had heard the devil preach: how men had no other souls than the beasts, and when they died, all was dead; and how he had let himself be forbidden by him the church and all churchly things. \\[Page 377\\]\n\nHe then asked the defendant: whether it was not all so? To which this one loudly and clearly said, \"Fa!\" and begged for mercy. Since Beauffort was without mitre, the speaker thereupon explained to the people: he owed it to the circumstance that he had confessed everything without torture, and never recanted. Tacquet, as he then continued, had taken part more than ten times, had consigned his soul, had promised never to betray one from the sect, and if he did so, driven by torture, to recant it before death. Cariens had moreover killed four children, from whom the salve had been prepared, and the harmful powders. Asked: whether it was not all true? he had replied: everything he had just spoken was nothing; as for what he had confessed, he had been forced to it by torture.\n\nHugnet, the fourth in the row, had nine witnesses against him; but whatever torture had been inflicted on him, he had always denied it, and even now, when grace was offered him if he confessed, he had replied: he knew nothing, and recognized nothing. He had, as it was said, been put to the torture more than fifteen times, sometimes twice in one day; he had been led to a nearby castle, and told: he should be forthwith beheaded if he did not confess; he had only repeated what had already been said. Once at nighttime he had attempted to flee from the prison, but had been recaptured; and that was counted against him as guilt.\n\nBeauffort was now declared a heretic, apostate, and idolater, and sentenced accordingly to seven years' imprisonment; however, he was to be publicly scourged on the shoulders with rods while clothed. He was further to pay 5,000 gold thalers, of which 76 made a fine mark, into the alms box at Mechelen for the war, and smaller sums to named hospitals and church foundations. Tacquet was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, to scourging, and to smaller fines. Cariens, who had already earlier been under investigation for the faith, and in whom no sign of repentance had become visible, was handed over to the secular sword. Huguet, who heard his judgment kneeling and weeping, was condemned to twenty years' confinement on water and bread.\n\nYet the rumor ran: he had, as a former servant of the bishop, been much favored by the vicars. Many said: there were so many Waldensians in the church, at the courts of the powerful, and elsewhere, that it was a wonder. It was also believed that the Antichrist had already been born; he would soon rule, and all Waldensians would form his following. Yet in Paris, Amiens, Tournai many had been arrested, men and women, but released again without harm being done to them. Cariens was burned, but beforehand declared all innocent upon whom he had testified. The vicars now set free all those who had not been brought to confession by torture, twelve in number.\n\nAgainst all of them witnesses had testified; they were interrogated under torture, some so often and severely that they were crippled; but they had persistently denied. They had to, before being released, swear their innocence on the Gospels; and for this, bring forward 4---5---7 honorable witnesses who likewise swore to their belief in the accused's innocence. They then still had to pay the court costs, and were mostly banished from the county. Only the Inquisitor P. le Broussart and the vicars of the bishop handled these releases; none of the others who were present at the interrogations took part in them, or were called upon to do so. \\[Page 378\\]\n\nMartin Cornille, who had fled but now sat in the prisons of the Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on, was now absolved by them from the excommunication that they had issued against him. A song that was found on the streets now harshly assailed the authors of the persecution. But on the following 16th of January 1402, a court messenger of the Parliament of Paris appeared in Arras to inquire into the injustice that had been done to the lord of Beaufort, as he had entered a complaint; as indeed Tacquet and others had also submitted complaints on this account; and also to make inquiry into the appeal that Beaufort had lodged with the Parliament before his interrogation.\n\nPhilip, his son, had brought the messenger there; both now went, along with the other three brothers and 30 friends, well armed to the vicars; and since these out of fear did not show themselves, the court messenger demanded the keys to the dungeon; and since the jailer refused them, he took them by force, freed the lord of Beaufort, and summoned the vicars to the 25th of February as the day on which they would have to stand to right before the Parliament in the matter of the appellant, whom he took with him to Paris. On the 1st, the vicars de Hamel and Thiebault betook themselves to Paris; but the matter was postponed, and they returned home. There they received letters from their bishop in Rome, who ordered: to set Huguet Aubry at liberty, which was accordingly done. Martin Cornille also returned, whom the Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on, after some investigations, had set at liberty.\n\nIn June the matter of Beaufort was finally heard before the Parliament, and on this occasion M. J. de Popincourt, parliamentary advocate and legal counsel to the plaintiff, said in open session among other things: how, as often as a prisoner was brought in on account of Waldensianism, he was told: if he did not confess what was said to him, he would be burned; only in the case of an open confession would he be let off with a small pilgrimage. If he then refused this, he was put to the torture until he confessed whatever one wanted. He said further: when the lord of Beaufort was brought in, and had sworn against Dean du Bois that he had not been in the Waldensianism; the dean had knelt before him and most urgently begged him: to confess, otherwise no one could save him from death by fire and the confiscation of his property.\n\nPity for his children alone moved him to this urgent plea, the fulfillment of which would procure him his freedom again within four days. When he replied that he would then have sworn falsely, the dean countered: he would give him absolution. By this and by more he had then been induced to make his confessions. Later he had also been compelled to pay considerable sums to the Duke, the Count of Estampes, the Bailiff of Amiens and his lieutenant, without having been sentenced to do so. The Parliament pronounced the plaintiff free from the prison sentence imposed upon him, had the three still under arrest in Arras brought before its bar, and set them likewise at liberty.\n\nBecause of a fourth \\[accused\\], Le Febvre, witnesses were examined, and after he had cleared himself before the Archbishop of Reims and the Bishop of Paris, he too was likewise set at liberty. The same happened with the last of the imprisoned, Hotin Longs. Before this had taken place, the Dean of Arras, M. J. du Bois, while on a journey to Corbie, had been seized by a mental illness, and he had been brought to Paris as if out of his senses. He stood in the reputation of a good cleric, was still young, and many lamented him. \\[Page 379\\]\n\nOthers said again: it was God's punishment, because it had happened on his instigation that inquiry was made into the Waldensians, and some burned; he had also taken the most pains to prove the reality of the matter. Those who said this did not believe in the air-flight in this Waldensianism. Although he came to his senses again, there was yet no security in it, and he had to keep himself always in his chamber. Finally he became bedridden, and then his body opened in many wounds, and he had much to suffer. Some said in this connection: he had been poisoned or bewitched by the Waldensians. In February 1461 he died in full possession of his faculties, and certainly made a good end.\n\nMeanwhile, in Burgundy, M. de Jehan, the Bishop of Barut, had been arrested in his birthplace, in order to learn from him what had actually determined him to stir up the matter with the Waldensianism in Arras. But soon he fled from this prison, and was, as he himself said, saved in a wonderful manner. He went to St.\u00a0James in Galicia, and on the return from there he remained behind in France as confessor to the wife of Charles the Seventh. M. Paille, who had likewise taken part in the affair, withdrew from Arras to Paris; similarly Gilles Flameng to Douai; and it was said: it had been because they were all not gladly seen in Arras.\n\nThe process between the appellants, the heirs of the sixth of Beaufort and all those prosecuted on account of Waldensianism, and the defendants, the Duke of Burgundy and his ecclesiastical and secular judicial authorities, before the Parliament, meanwhile went its course. In the eighth year of King Charles VII, in the year 1491, the judgment was finally pronounced, which decided: that the said appellees had acted badly and abusively, had spoken, imprisoned, fined, proceeded, sentenced, and executed; and that the said appellants had rightly appealed. It then cassates all these processes, as well those conducted in the ecclesiastical as in the secular courts; the acts shall be torn up and destroyed, all made confiscations annulled and rendered void, the defendants personally condemned to make compensation, to the costs of the process, and moreover to a fine of 6500 Paris livres; of which 1500 francs shall be taken to establish a daily mass in perpetuity, for the souls' peace of the executed, in the cathedral of Arras; also a stone cross with an inscription shall be erected on the place of execution. The ecclesiastical courts of Arras were forbidden, in future processes, to make use of any extraordinary executions and cruel tortures. The sentence was solemnly proclaimed on the place of execution, a sermon held upon it, and on that day all work in the city had to be suspended.\n\nOne sees, this affair is just as instructive through its errors and blunders as the previous one was through justice, prudence, and thoroughness. Moreover, in order to pass a just and not hasty judgment upon it, we must first transport ourselves into the time in which it occurred. It was the middle of the fifteenth century, whose beginning had seen three popes at once on the chair and three emperors on the throne; only the outward expression for the weakening which the unity in church and state, amid the increasing power of multiplicity, had suffered in the wake of the earlier struggles between the two powers. \\[Page 380\\]\n\nThe ecclesiastical unity had fallen in Avignon into the power of French politics; that of the state in the emperor into that of the ever-increasing estates of the realm through constant encroachments; the consequence was a dissolution of the entire common and ecclesiastical order throughout all the European realms. In the church, therefore, the beginning of the newer heresies with Wycliffe and with Huss, and in their wake the Hussite wars. In the hierarchy, the disruption of the inner wholeness and cohesion, the rebellion of the members against one another and against the unity; at the councils of Constance and of Basel, the prelates and the lower priestly orders in strife. After the restoration of the see in Rome, constant struggles of its occupant with the unruly territorial nobility.\n\nIn the state, a similar dissolution of the old enclosed feudal state into its elements; the territorial lordship in conflict upward and downward, armed brotherhoods of equals against those higher and lower in rank, the struggle of feudal law with the public peace, of the old manner of warfare with the new, the gradual complete dissolution of the central authority. Between England and France in particular the great, centuries-long struggles over the succession, and in their train the great civil wars in both feudal states, that of the white and the red rose in England, Burgundy and the overlord in France; in both realms at last the unity, with the Tudors and Louis XI, triumphing everywhere; the world traversed by condottieri, Armagnacs, Landsknechts, black mercenaries; brazen outrage, violence, the impotence of the administration of justice prevailing throughout all Christendom.\n\nIn the wake of this fermenting dissolution of all elements of civil order and the prevailing savagery, then the greatest immorality; Venus the wandering strumpet dug out as the first among all the gods of heathendom; all cities filled with courtesans, even at the church assembly of Constance an incredible number of them, in the city where it had taken its seat; as Nider relates, on account of the presence of the many princes and their retinues, as well as the numerous craftsmen. In all this, France-ravaged Italy, standing closest to the contagion from the East in any case, going ahead with a good example; and out of the midst of this loathsome corruption, as the scourge of avenging Nemesis, the venereal disease developing itself. Added to this now the fall of the Greek emperorship, which had occurred beyond the straits.\n\nBehind the storming Ottomans then at last Gog and Magog unleashed in Timur and the Mongols; Europe, and the sink of all vices in it, threatened with an inundation from the East, and these floods already breaking on the borders of Bavaria. Such was the state of European society at that time. Was it surprising, in this hopeless state of affairs, if serious minds came to the opinion: the world, now grown hoary with age and decrepit, was hastening toward imminent dissolution; the time was approaching that had been foretold by earlier prophets who had foreseen their agony in visions, and now it was inclining toward the end.\n\nHad Christianity visibly lost its power, while the power of evil had strengthened itself everywhere; then the time of the Antichrist had arrived, to whom dominion was given for two times and half a time, and who should unite and assemble all his own under his sign. He was already born, this adversary; all signs seemed to proclaim his nearness, and the people believed, as we have seen, in his presence. What the coming times should behold in the light of day must now prepare itself in the veil of night; there he must recognize his own, enter them in his registers, and exercise them in all villainy. \\[Page 381\\]\n\nAt the courts he had begun this work of his; from there he had proceeded to the aristocracy; what de Rais had practiced in Brittany, what Lady Fowlis had practiced in Scotland, had not remained unknown; what had occurred in Avignon in the vicinity of the Prince of the Church, what doctrines had gained entry into the College of Cardinals, and what morals had arisen from them, which had later even raised Alexander VI to the throne: all of this had remained no secret; Master Jehan, Bishop of Barut, had seen it all quite close at hand as Grand Penitentiary. It was no wonder, then, that what had earlier circulated concerning immediate pacts of men with the demon, what had haunted here and there in the licentiousness of the age that recoiled before no crime, that it, heaped up and multiplied, should suddenly coalesce in anxious minds into the dread image of the Waldensians or Vauderie.\n\nTo the Bishop of Barut was joined the dean, M. Jacques du Bois, at that time a man of twenty-four years, of good repute, of whom that threatening song itself spoke: \"Chascun cuidoit que iu keusses proph\u00e8te, --- Sage comme un Salomon ou Sibille; --- Mais si du sens quy oneq feust en ta leste, --- tu a voulu semer une tempeste, --- tu beueras ton brassin ei brouct; --- Er sy seras des premiers \u00e0 la feste. --- Folie fait quy folie com met.\"\n\nBoth, studying the Apocalypse in the course of the world at that time, may long since have arrived at the suspicion of a secret connection between a part of it and the demon; the ever-increasing audacity in crime of the century must have confirmed them in it more and more. Now had come the deposition of Robinet de Vaulx, born in Artois, who had testified against the Demoiselle and the Abb\u00e9 la Vitte, the former a Sister of Joy, the latter---as it appears---a brother more than merely merry; and the word Vauderie, which at the surprising confusion immediately brought to their minds the Manichaeans, the worshippers of the demon, had been acknowledged by the Demoiselle at her arrest. Now they had found the trail, which they needed only to follow in order to find their view confirmed all too fully.\n\nThat the hermit had probably made his deposition under torture could, given the reverence that this faithless instrument---which the ecclesiastical courts should never have accepted---enjoyed at that time, by no means lead them astray. It was applied against the two prisoners as well; the gate of the secret had been burst open, and the mystery of iniquity now lay exposed before them. That a woman of the Vauderie, as the reporter says of her, and a frivolous cleric and wandering singer, designated by popular wit with the mocking name \"de peu de sens,\" were little suited to serve, in a matter of such weight involving life and death, as foundational witnesses, had not occurred to them. If doubts arose in them, the torture, applied also against other arrested persons, immediately dispersed them. \\[Page 382\\]\n\nIf suspicion fell upon the instrument, then voluntary confessions appeared, either tricked out by promises, or also---since the matter lay in the intentions of many at that time and surely lacked not all foundation---here and there called forth by remorse, or also brought about by the simplicity of the afflicted in order to save themselves, coming in to pacify; and they found support again in the general belief around them. The surprise on account of the discovery made was, it seemed, so great that immediately the spectral image of the pact with all its terrors stood before them: how it possessed a third of the human race, how bishops and cardinals belonged to it, princes without doubt as well, and how only the Mighty One was still lacking to it, in order at its head to carry out all the plans of the abyss.\n\nSince the poor testimony given by the Veltnerin was joined by that of the witnesses brought forward by her, who had been in Waldensia---a testimony which, even if given voluntarily, could only ground a suspicion of innocence---; the error thereby increased, and it was firmly established: All must die who had been denounced by four such witnesses. Whoever spoke against the system thereby rendered himself suspect of the vice; and it was soon likewise considered proven that no one could be accused unless he had truly made himself guilty of it; for which reason the contradiction to an earlier confession, made in the face of the flames, must also be invalid, because the demon had driven him to it.\n\nThus there developed a system of terror, before which nothing could stand once it had come within its scope; and this reached its height in the delusion of M. Jehan, who believed he could already recognize guilt or innocence from the physiognomy. No age may deem itself entirely secure from the possibility of falling prey to such errors; and should the present one, in the consciousness of its enlightenment, harbor such presumption; then one might remind it only of that twofold doubled attack of the disease which has befallen it in our days. The first at that time, when the Jesuits were supposed to be regicides from bloodlust, corrupters of morals and custom through their discipline, state-endangering conspirators from habit, accumulators of wealth from insatiable greed.\n\nThe order knows how to recount how the fixed idea of the delirious patient played its tricks on it; and since the attack, the specific smell will not yet depart from the nose of the Jesuit-sniffers. For the second and third, the attack has returned in the Revolution, once in the heads of the terrorists, who have armed their political virtue-logic with the guillotine, and subsidiarily assigned fire and water as helpers to it; and on the other side in the opposite siren idea of their battle-victims and the higher estates: that all this had already long ago been prepared for them by the dying Templars, and carried forward through secret societies, come to outbreak only in our days. And when finally, fourthly, the demagogic machinations emerged, how far, one believes, might this mania also have led, which could by no means lack defensible grounds, if torture had been at the disposal of those seized by it? All these examples show how dangerous it is for men, most dangerous for those who are of good will in it, to engage in such treasure-hunting in the depths of the human world of thought, in which God alone knows the way. \\[Page 383\\]\n\nIn the present matter of the Waldenses, it was the preserving instinct which, in the opposition of the vicars against this terroristic doctrine, first made itself felt; but the strict observance then still overcame the mildness. That emerged again in the opposition of the chapter lords of Cambrai and several bishops, but could likewise not make itself felt against the first zeal. Only the council of the prudhommes of Duke Philip of Burgundy in Brussels brought about a turning point. That the investigators had been sincere was proven by the circumstance: that they extended the investigation, without distinction, to the poor as well as to the rich and powerful; but that also brought about a swift conclusion to the matter. The Parliament of Paris took an interest in the affair.\n\nThe thirty years which the process lasted are filled, to a great part, with the perfidious, violent, but snake-cunning government of Louis XI and the fall of the House of Burgundy, and the death of Charles of Lorraine; circumstances which, as can scarcely be doubted, exerted their influence on the course of the legal proceedings. But as it has ever been in such matters, the Parliament has judged rightly, and Nemesis has not neglected to collect the debt fallen due to her.\n\nFor however little the age may have esteemed blood in its feuds and struggles, the shed blood cries out to heaven and demands its atonement. Not the mercy that leads man in good disposition toward a good end justifies him alone; if he does not cooper"}, "The Witches' Conspiracy Against King James I": {"start_char": 1245070, "end_char": 1246899, "pages": "386-386", "keywords": ["- testimony against gaufredi"], "verbatim": "ith James I in the year 1591.\n\nAt that strange witches' conspiracy which had formed against him, he took great pleasure in being personally present at all the investigations and proceedings. The main figure in the whole affair was Cunningham, usually called Dr.\u00a0Fian in the records, a schoolmaster near Tranent; as it appears, a dissolute man, but, as emerged, one of great strength of soul and firm nerves. The knotted cord was first placed around his head, and he confessed nothing; gentle persuasion led equally little to the goal; finally the Spanish boots were applied to him, and when, after three tightenings, pressure was brought to bear for a confession, his tongue failed him. Later he signed a confession in which he admitted guilt for directing witchcraft against the king and uncovered the scandals of his life. But in the following night the apparently penitent man attempted to escape, was indeed recaptured, but now sought to deny everything previously confessed.\n\nJames, in view of his stubborn obstinacy, devised a new torture himself: the nails were torn from him with pincers, and under each two needles were driven in up to their heads. But amid these pains he did not flinch, and confessed nothing; the boots were applied to him again, and drawn so tightly that the legs burst and blood and marrow spurted out, so that they were crippled forever. However it may have gone with his confession, it agreed in all circumstances with that of Agnes Sampson, whom Spottiswoode describes as a worthy, truthful matron in her statements, and who had declared herself a witch. From Janet Bowman's pyre in the year 1572 to the end of James's reign, another 35 witch trials up to 1625 are recorded in the records of the court, and Archbishop Spotswood relates that the greater part of the winter was always spent on the "}, "The Death of Sir Lewis Bellenden from a Demon's Appearance": {"start_char": 1247029, "end_char": 1247146, "pages": "386-386", "keywords": ["grunting of many swine in demon appearance", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "s.

The people were in despair, and attributed their misery and the unfruitfulness of the years to evil arts and to the witch-folk. In the officials of the time, among whom the distress now also awakened gold-greed, they found all too willing help to render this their belief pernicious to many. Through the whole diocese, all cities and villages, there now ran---as an eyewitness relates---accusers, inquisitors, judges, minions, and executioner's assistants, who seized all suspects and burned them in great numbers; for scarcely one escaped who had once been accused. \\[Page 388\\]\n\nSoon the terror spread also into the city of Trier, and soon spared not even the former blood-judges themselves; for Dietrich Flade, rector of the university and city schultheiss, who had led a great multitude of those unfortunates to the stake, was burned in 1586 according to the rules of his own judicial procedure. Him followed in death two mayors and several senators and judges. Canons of several chapters, pastors, rural deans had the same fate. In two villages at about the same time only two women remained; for the fury of the people and the madness of the judges had only ever increased; so that scarcely one remained whom suspicion had not struck. The notaries, the actuaries, and the innkeepers enriched themselves meanwhile; the executioner rode like a courtier on a high horse, clad in gold and silver; his wife vied in finery with the nobles.\n\nThe children of the condemned wandered forth, their goods were confiscated. There began to be a shortage of field hands and vinedressers; hence the unfruitfulness. Scarcely, men thought, had a worse plague ever raged in the archbishopric, or a madder foe wreaked havoc, than these trackers, who struck so many for whose innocence there was manifold likelihood. The persecution lasted several years; many of the superiors boasted of the multitude of pyres they had erected. Impoverishment was the consequence: now laws were given and enforced against the abomination, and now it died out, just as the war died out with the exhaustion of the money, so the fury of the witch-judges. In scarcely seven years, from"}, "The Demonic Possession of Magdalena von Palnd and Louise Capelle": {"start_char": 1255499, "end_char": 1269636, "pages": "389-392", "keywords": ["five demons possessing magdalena", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "In scarcely seven years, from 1587--93, 365 persons were burned from 20 villages near the city.\n\nIn all this the Antichrist was indeed present, although perhaps more in the judges than in the judged: and so men easily came to the belief that he must really and personally have been born. That introduced a new error into the matter. The exorcists, aware of their power in the obsessions brought about by magic, came upon the idea of making use of this power to compel the demon against his will to bear witness to the truth, and thus to spy out the secrets of his realm through himself.\n\nFor the first time, to our knowledge, use was made thereof in the matter of the Count of Gaftedy: Magdalena von Palnd, his betrothed, had, against his will and at the age of fourteen, entered the convent of the holy Ursula, and had placed herself under the obedience of Father Romillon, a former Calvinist. As she thereupon fell into a possession, the peace of the convent was suddenly disturbed thereby; for five of the sisters residing there soon found themselves likewise possessed. Among them was one in particular who was most affected by it, Louise Capelle, from the county of Avignon, likewise descended from heretical parents, originating in St.\u00a0Remi, near that county; a simple, pious girl skilled in household tasks. Magdalena was for a long time unsuccessfully exorcised in secret, but then taken to St.\u00a0Baume, and there given over to continued exorcism to Father F. Dompt, a Fleming, Doctor of Theology at Louvain and a Dominican. With her had come Louise, to manage the household, who at that time was not yet suspected of possession; which, however, soon betrayed itself through tone and glance; while Magdalena, in her attacks, was repeatedly lifted into the air to tear her from the exorcist who held her. \\[Page 389\\]\n\nOn the eighth of December 1610, the spirits of Louise named themselves: first Verin the superior, and then Gressil and Sonnillon, his subordinates. On the day of the Conception of Mary, Verin began through her mouth to deliver a great eulogy of the blessed Virgin, concluding it thus: that he spoke not out of love for her, but compelled by fear of God, who is able to call forth all things from nothing. Catherine of France, an ecstatic sister, brought Magdalena there during this speech; and now Verin, upon beholding her, began to call out to the stronger demon who dwelt in the one present: \"Though thou art my master, yet one greater than thou wills that I now speak in thy presence.\"\n\nThen this one rose up raging in Magdalena, bellowed like a bull, and threw her shoe at the speaker's head. But Verin continued to deliver to her an eloquent exhortation to repentance and renunciation of the evil one, which closed with the exclamation: \"Wonder, unheard-of wonder, that the devil himself saves souls, and serves them as physician and surgeon!\" Magdalena, who might have seen collusion and deceit in this scene, remained unmoved; the bystanders prayed the Psalms for her, and this seemed to bend her hardened spirit. She burst into tears, and throwing herself down before the others, declared herself a perverse and wretched creature.\n\nNow the ice was broken, and the work of conversion proceeded on its course. Verin pursued it with great insistent eloquence; and one of the possessed laid to heart for the other everything that could possibly be helpful to snatch her from the power she had hitherto served and lead her back to heaven. When the priest offered the Eucharist to both possessed ones with the words: \"Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi!\", the spirit cried out from Magdalena: \"Well for you a lamb, for us a roaring lion!\" When the priest commanded him to adore his God, he replied: \"What, should I adore this God, this God should I adore? I will not do it, I shall never do it, in defiance of thee, O Christ; in mockery of thee, O Mary, and of thee, O Magdalena, who art mine!\" Verin now cried: \"Ha, wretch, accursed one, like me! Thou hast no power over Magdalena, who will take the Lord as her bridegroom.\" \"No,\" screamed the other, \"she is my bride, and I will prove it.\"\n\nSo the spirits quarreled with one another; but the one belonging to the neophyte always drew the shorter end, yet avenged itself on her by from time to time calling forth the most violent paroxysms: it threw her to the ground, stirred up the most furious convulsions in her, and made known to the whole world through her mouth her most secret sins, which only her confessors knew, and at night it plagued her with incubi. Meanwhile Verrin continued his instruction in the Christian doctrine; at every section confirming the truth of what was said with a solemn oath. He held before her how she had three times renounced her God, who now might yet have mercy on her soul: O Magdalena! if the stars of the firmament could express thanks, if the leaves of the trees could understand these words, if the stones of St.\u00a0Baume had a voice, they would all praise God for it; for your sins are many, like the sand on the sea. The hard heart of the sinner slowly softened; she had frequent relapses into impatience and despair; terrifying visions frightened her sorely; the demonically ecstatic girl did not cease, with great eloquence, to press upon her again and again. \\[Page 390\\]\n\nNow she confessed herself once more before all those present, who had come streaming together from far and wide, as a sinner worthy of hell; and she laid herself down before the church door, begging the passersby to trample her as the most wretched creature with their feet. She now gave the signs on her body, one of which proved visible upon examination; and during the exorcism a number of spirits went out from her, though this did not lift her obsession; just as with Louise, after the departure of the two lower ones, Verrin had remained behind. Her torments returned in between with renewed strength; she was lifted up high by the demon, she lost---especially when she wanted to go to confession---often her sight and hearing for several days; imagination and memory were often bound to her, her whole body sometimes swelled up; her eyes became like burning lamps, distortions ran over her face, and for 15 days Asmodeus defiled her every evening under the exorcism, by calling forth the most obscene movements in her, during which she always believed she saw Louis Gaufredi.\n\nDuring these proceedings, Verrin had testified several times: that it was Louis Gaufredi, at the church of the Accoules in Marseille, who had seduced Magdalena; that he had made her renounce her baptism and her share in paradise; that he had given her the demon, and possessed her handwriting. He had cried out like one in despair that the living God forced him to this testimony, and he swore: that everything he had said was true, and he had laid a solemn oath upon the altar sacrament thereon. The priests, who had been witnesses to this, had remembered the church precept: to warn the sinning brother three times, and therefore had him admonished three times.\n\nOnce it had happened orally through Brother Franciscus; then in writing through a more urgent letter, which they wrote to him as eyewitnesses and earwitnesses of the oath, and in which they promised him that if he came to St.\u00a0Baume and there converted himself in quiet; then his sins should remain hidden, as if he had laid them down in the confessional. In the third, they had urged the Capuchins in Marseille to send three of their own with the guardian, and to bring the final admonition in a second letter to him. But the Capuchins did not want to involve themselves in this matter without prior consultation with Father Michaelis; all the less so, since the demon from another possessed woman in Aix had said and sworn: that Gaufredi was no sorcerer, and that Magdalena was not afflicted by any malevolent spell.; which Verin immediately declared to be a cunning trick of Lucifer, and the spirit of Magdalena confirmed it.\n\nVerin, for his part, now allowed himself to be commanded by the exorcist to go himself to Marseille for the conversion of the sinner, and Louise felt that he departed from her like a wind; she truly remained free of him in his absence, however with the feeling of pain from the maleficium. Thus he went a second, third, and fourth time, always fruitlessly, and on that account broke forth into curses against him: because he surpassed all sorcerers in wickedness, therefore he was the head of all sabbaths. Cain and Judas were innocent in comparison to him, and the demons themselves were of the opinion that hell was not sufficient to punish him. He had abjured God and all angels and saints; now God made use of that to which he alone had not abjured, namely the demon, in order to convert him. The time of the last and worst heresy had come; all of France was already infected by it. \\[Page 391\\]\n\nMeanwhile, Gaufredy had nevertheless resolved to go to St.\u00a0Baume in the company of two Capuchins and Father Michaelis, and he arrived there on the evening of the 21st of December. It was decided to leave the exorcism of Louise to him, and Father Michaelis delegated his authority to him for that purpose. Verin began with a prayer in which he most urgently and heartily besought the Lord for grace for him; which moved the hearts of many, but did not please others, who believed that he should not be allowed to speak, and that he must be interrupted. But he continued and asked his exorcist Gaufredy: Is God almighty or not? The one questioned replied: This one is almighty. Then the other asked: Has the Church the power to command the demons? He answered: She has this power. Then he posed the third question: whether the demons could be compelled to tell the truth, and whether the oaths of the demons, sworn in all form and solemnity, were valid or not? He answered: They are valid, and God can compel the demon to tell the truth. Verin now said: Take good note of what he has admitted; but turning to him: Then exorcise me! It was done, and at the end Verin adjured him anew to renounce magic and to turn to God.\n\nHe then swore by the holy sacrament that all was true which he had said earlier, and Magdalena swore the same with a double oath. Then he said further that he must be guarded in St.\u00a0Baume. The imprudent one had now ensnared himself; but on the following morning, dissension broke out among the clergy, which had already stirred earlier. Father Michaelis and the Capuchins excluded Father Romillon and the Dominican father Franciscus Dompt from their council, and in the course of the day the latter was told: he was proud, disobedient, ambitious, and striving after vain glory, and in all this sought only himself. Others judged again: he was all too credulous; still others judged differently.\n\nLouise too was treated contemptuously, and Verin said that day to Father Romillon: she would follow another calling, and did not deserve this treatment. He also broke the silence imposed upon him against Father Michaelis. The Dominican father threw himself, in the presence of the other Capuchins, at the feet of Father Michaelis, and begged permission to return to his province, however not with complete humility: yet he wished to withdraw himself from the matter, because Father Michaelis would not listen to him, but rather to those who maintained: Verin must not be allowed to speak; Louise was not possessed, and the whole affair seemed more from the devil than from God. In this uncertainty they nevertheless continued; on the following evening Father Michaelis exorcised, Gaufredy renounced magic, and Verin said Amen. Later he cried: Adam, where art thou? Out of the depths call to God thy Lord, and he will hear thee!\n\nHe compared him, in the following days, when the struggle within him seemed to persist, to a man mortally ill who had lost his memory. He also said: the Antichrist had already been born, of a Jewess with an incubus; the magicians were his forerunners, and God wished to prepare His Church for the impending dangers. Meanwhile, Father Michaelis conducted tests with the two women, in order to convince himself and the councilors of the Parliament of Aix, who had taken cognizance of the matter, whether they were truly possessed. Berrin said on that occasion, when silence was imposed upon him: O Michaelis, God looses me, but you bind me. \\[Page 392\\]\n\nGaufridy meanwhile renounced his written pacts, but the spirits cried out: it was not earnest with him, and he was only playing the Pharisee; holy on the outside, full of filth within. He sharply rebuked the exorcists for demanding signs from him; he must indeed, as they said, be the Bridegroom of the Church, but she too must obey her Bridegroom, who had resolved to give her light through him; they, however, imposed silence upon him. When he caught sight of Gaufridy, he began to bark, like a dog in the presence of a wolf nearby, and announced to him: if within eight days his sincere conversion did not take place, he would be burned to ashes. They say Louise is bound in her imagination; but the earth would have to swallow her, and you would have to deliver her to the flames, if she were not possessed, and if she had not sworn those many oaths of her own accord.\n\nMeanwhile, he always refused to speak in a foreign tongue; God would not have it, he would give no signs; for if he sent an archangel in his invisible form, they would say: it is the devil; but if in his visible form, it would be said: it is a man. On the tenth of January, finally, some of the more prominent men of Marseille came to St.\u00a0Baume, in order to lead Gaufridy back to their city. Silence was imposed upon Verin, from the Dominican Al\u00e8s what he had written was violently taken away, and he himself was arrested for a few hours; everything stood against him, and wherever he turned he encountered mocking words, scorn, humiliation; and they even threatened to have everything that had happened declared null and void, as if undone, by the synod and the Bishop of Marseille! Upon closer investigation, however---which ensued because the Parliament had taken the matter i"}, "The Demonic Possessions in the Brigittine Convent": {"start_char": 1269684, "end_char": 1280816, "pages": "393-396", "keywords": ["- possession in quercy convent 1491"], "verbatim": " women's real possession, and the papers were returned.\n\nThus what had begun in 1610 at St.\u00a0Baume continued in 1613 in the Netherlands. There, in a newly founded Brigittine convent, the three nuns Francisca Bolline\u0219ia, Catharina Fourner, and Perona Imberta had fallen into obsession; and at the request of the bishop of the diocese, the provincial of the Dominicans had appointed the same Father Dompt as their exorcist, to whom a Minorite, Father F. Michaelis, was assigned as assistant. They betook themselves to the place; at first the spirits were rebellious, but in the end they were subdued, and unanimously testified to Maria of Sains as the originator of the malefice. When questioned, she denied everything; but when the spirit of one of them revealed that she bore the marks of the demon, she confessed and herself indicated the places of these marks. At first she had to be compelled to these confessions by exorcism, but soon she did so voluntarily. Besides the three, all the others in the convent likewise suffered various afflictions, and she had been the primary originator of all these evils; despite the extraordinary reputation for holiness in which she stood, suspicion had soon fallen upon her; she had been locked up, but at that time had confessed nothing. Now she revealed that she had brought it about through a double malefice, in order thereby to destroy the young foundation. \\[Page 393\\]\n\nShe confessed still countless other crimes of this sort; also how the exorcists had long since been well known to her, inasmuch as she had seen them in St.\u00a0Baume, whither her demon Astaroth had carried her. We have already mentioned earlier what statements this resolute woman, who recoiled from no atrocity, had made; and how she herself had not shrunk from maltreating the Heavenly ones. While she continued unceasingly to make new confessions concerning the demons who obsessed her, she visited, according to her account, the Sabbath without interruption; and she always brought new signs with her, which the investigation conducted each time confirmed. Among other things, she also began to speak of the Antichrist, in which the three other demons assisted her. He was not begotten through man's agency, but through the demon; the earth had never produced a creature equal to him in wickedness. He travels through the air and performs signs and wonders. Maria de Sains knows him and has seen him in the synagogue, where he received baptism.\n\nNow he is in his boyhood years; born in Babylon, raised in Capernaum in the land of Judea, he will one day rule the whole world from Jerusalem. But before his thirtieth year, he shall not be recognized in his full significance; then he shall reign a little over three years, and numerous heralds shall go before him. Beelzebub has declared him to be his son, and they call him Creator of Heaven and Earth, also Christ, King and Messiah. Gaufridy has administered baptism to him in his official capacity, Magdalena Palud and Maria de Sains were his godparents. Before his mother they kneel on the Sabbath, and say Ave etc., and she follows immediately in rank after the princes of the demons. She wallows in all prostitution, yet is called the Flower of Beauty.\n\nOn feast days he is brought to the Sabbath; there, said Marie, he kissed and embraced me and said: I was exceedingly beautiful, had beautiful smooth hair, and amiable and shining eyes; of all this he spoke like a grown man. Many will cling to him when he makes himself known, and everything that is written about him in the Apocalypse will be fulfilled. What now happens secretly among the sorcerers will then happen openly; nothing will be impossible to him, and his own will therefore believe him omnipotent. His sign will be the form of a goat; pressed upon the forehead among the more noble, upon the hand among the lowly. On the Sabbath they bring him, in celebration of his birthday, their gifts just as in the Epiphany to the Lord, and pay him homage thereby, and the prince of the magicians celebrates the day with three masses. \\[Page 394\\]\n\nA half year before his birth, however, in the year 1609, a boy was born to Magdalena; begotten by Gaufridy, according to the opinion of most, so that he might become the forerunner of the Antichrist; his name is Adocucy: and more beautiful and lovable than he himself, he will be raised with him in the Orient. When the time has run its course, this one will rise up against the Church; more will believe in him than have believed in Christ; the Jews will see in him their Messiah; he will transplant all the torments of Hell to earth, and apply them against the Christians; all heresies long since extinguished will revive, and Rome will fall. In place of the destroyed churches he will build new synagogues for himself, and they will honor his image there as they do him himself, and sacrifice Christian children to him; but he will secretly worship Lucifer, who will be loosed in this time, in which all vices will count as virtues, and will be preached as such by the magicians. He will perform signs and wonders, raise the dead, heal the sick; his images will speak like living beings, but many martyrs will lose their lives in these times. To him as guardians and watchmen and companions, however, Maria de Sains has borne two boys, and the nun Simona two others; they are strong as Samson, powerful and noble above all others.\n\nThe Simona who is here in question, like Sains, born in the city of Lille, had entered with her into the local Brigitten Convent; her accomplice in all her schemes and intrigues, she had also accused herself of the same things simultaneously with her. Since she was still a novice, they had therefore taken away her habit for that reason; but during the year in which she was kept locked up in the bishop's prison, she had confessed nothing. She was then released at the urging of her superiors and relatives, and had gone to Valenciennes; where she hired herself out as a maid, and thereby kept her whereabouts completely hidden from everyone. A man from Lille had fallen in love with her there, and offered her his hand; she consented, but since she needed the consent of her superiors for it, he went to obtain it; with the prohibition, however, on her part, to reveal her whereabouts to anyone.\n\nBut he did not keep his secret to himself, it became known through the women; Father Domptius, who was very interested in questioning her likewise about these matters, brought about her arrest. On July 29, 1613, he came, accompanied by two commissioners assigned to him and Maria de Sains, to Valenciennes; where they visited the arrested woman, who, however, denied everything. Maria, meanwhile, insisted on her accusation; if this one were not a sorceress, there would be none in the world. She was confronted with her; but since she always persisted in her denial, they decided to call upon the possessed ones to speak. Simona, however, replied: they might come, she did not fear the devils. The possessed ones were called forth, and now the same play began as in St.\u00a0Baume: Tevtathan spoke through the person of Perona and Maria and sought to bring her to confession, also urging the commissioners to apply torture; but although the three possessed ones testified against her with one voice, she remained unshaken. \\[Page 395\\]\n\nMaria now indicated the locations of her marks with ink; she meanwhile kept crying out \"Ah\" and \"Woe!\" because she believed she was being examined; but when later actually probed, the indicated spots proved bloodless and insensible. When she objected: that when she herself had just examined one spot, blood had flowed, Maria, called in, said: \"Last night you received a mark on your hand in the synagogue\"; she indicated the spot, and it was found to be such. Great, eloquent apostrophes to the arrested woman now followed; but Simona was not moved by them. She said: she did not consider herself guilty of what they demanded of her; Maria replied, so it had been with her too, only when she had affirmed the questions had her memory returned. Simona answered: she would not say \"yes\" until she had true knowledge of what she was to affirm; all their speeches now appeared to her like dreams. Thereupon Maria: so it had often happened to her too; but the father had then asked her: whether her marks were likewise illusions? Maria tried many more means on her, confessing herself as the worst sinner; they brought Simona into a church and exorcised her at midnight, the hour of the Sabbath; the spirits joined in speaking, and swore vehemently; Simona remained unmoved.\n\nOn the following day Maria reported: the hour of the Sabbath had been shifted to three o'clock in the morning; both of them had been there, and Simona had brought three marks. They were found, exactly as she described, on the left arm. One of the possessed women now swore a solemn oath: that she was a sorceress, and now the same three questions were put to her as to Gaufridy. She affirmed all of them, yet maintained: the possessed one did not speak the truth regarding her, and finally said: she would no longer answer the spirits henceforth; when they had talked themselves out, they would fall silent of their own accord.\n\nThe demons now press upon the silent one, presenting to her: what God has done for her, how all the saints of heaven have interceded for her; how her hardness of heart, in thrusting away all this grace from herself, has infinitely heaped up the measure of her sins, and will finally, at the approaching downfall of the world, make her a child of perdition. This at last seemed to break her stubborn spirit, and she began to weep. All those present urged her on, she wept more violently; the Dominican placed the Sacrament upon her head, and still weeping she cried out: I will say no more, I say no more no!\n\nThe demon drew nearer to her and said: The eternal Father receives you, the Son pleads for you that he may receive you, all the saints unite their supplications. She, entirely dissolved in lamentations, said: I am a sorceress, truly I am such a one. The demon spoke through the mouth of the Perona: By this God who created the angels and cast us out, do you deny that I am Beelzebub, the prince of the demons, who has so often marked you? She replied: I know you, I say it with displeasure, God's power compels me to it. Now follow in sequence the confessions, during which the demons of the possessed assist her helpfully and refresh her memory; yet on the second day already, when asked if she persisted, she said: I dare not contradict, but if I agree, then everything seems to me like a dream; and it comes to me as if I were speaking lies. \\[Page 396\\]\n\nIn between, she herself gave signs on her body, confirmed the statements of the others regarding the manner of the Sabbath, regarding the birth of the Antichrist; she shared sermons that Beelzebub had delivered there; she censured the doctrines of Binsfeld with the saintly condemnations, and corrected the statements of this saint, whereby again the demons helped, and Simona and Maria sang Latin hymns of praise to t"}, "The Demonic Possession of the Louviers Nuns": {"start_char": 648012, "end_char": 653933, "pages": "197-199", "keywords": ["stages of demonic possession", "possession", "demonic possession"], "verbatim": "[Page 197\\]\n\nThen the invoked spirit appeared to him, talked him out of his scruples against a pact, and concluded such a one on the condition that, in return for the threefold surrender of his soul, his body, and all his actions, he would render him threefold service: to make him the most honored of all priests in Provence; to grant him 34 years of life without illness or other affliction; and to inflame in his name all women whom he breathed upon with love for him. He now goes to Marseille and obtains there, at the church of the Accoules, a benefice. The fame of his holiness soon fills the region; all women crowd to his confessional, and he now finds opportunity to apply the magic of his breath, more than a thousand times, as he says, and rejoices as all around bursts into love for him. The wife of the innkeeper Perrin was brought so far that a palpitating heart announced to her his approach from afar each time; another, named Bouchette, and a third, named Pintade, likewise became, one after another, victims of his lusts. But preeminently the three daughters of a nobleman, Mandals de la Pallus, and among them especially the then ten-year-old Magdalena, had aroused this lust of his, because his reputation had granted him free access to the house. Since the girl had taken him as her confessor, he had already in this relation allowed himself many liberties with her, and a deep melancholy had developed in her from such intercourse. She often lived on an estate near the city, and he too went there back and forth. First he breathed upon the mother, so that she too was won over and led the daughter to the seducer; whom he himself likewise so often made to feel the power of his breath, and whom moreover he assailed multifariously with other magic, until she, meanwhile advanced in age, yielded herself to him. When he once found her alone on the country estate, he induced her to accompany him to a cave near the estate, where he promised to show her great wonders. There they found many men and women engaged in dancing around the goat. Magdalena at first felt a great terror, but Goffredy gave her courage: they were only her friends whom she saw gathered here, and whose company she henceforth should belong to. \\[Page 198\\]\n\nHe had previously told her: for her sake he had called upon all the demonic powers to his aid; and since he had now won everything in her, he wished to unite her in the bonds of marriage with the prince of the demons, so that she might find herself united with him and one another in him, with all the greater security, indissolubly. She, who had already previously acknowledged the principle that the spiritual fathers had the right to dispose over their spiritual daughters, also took a liking to this proposal. This was now concluded and carried out in this assembly. She was baptized with sulfur, salt, and urine; she now renounced, from her whole heart, from all her powers, and from her entire soul, her God and her faith, and signed the renunciation with the blood from the little finger of her right hand, which he had incised. Six or seven written vows followed this first one, to draw the already tied knot even tighter. She was then marked on her head, on her heart, and on various other places; and now all those present danced around her jubilantly, and in general acclamation they proclaimed the newly received one as the princess of the Sabbath; which she from then on regularly attended in this capacity. Goffredy himself had already belonged to it since his pact; they had appointed him there as prince of the synagogues of France, Spain, England, Teutschland, Turkey, thus of Europe and a part of Asia; and as such he had visited the Sabbaths of all these countries and presided over them.\n\nHer master thereupon gave her the demon Asmodeus as her attendant, so that he might serve her, guard her for him, and preserve and increase in her the love for him. Things had thus proceeded for a time when the bizarre thought came to her: to enter the convent of the holy Ursula, which flourished under the care of the priests of the Christian Doctrine. Goffredy opposed this plan with the utmost vigor; but since he could not become master over it, he threatened to unleash the powers of hell against the convent. She remained three years with the Ursulines in considerable calm, only that on Wednesdays and Fridays, the critical days when the Sabbath was held, a black melancholy would take possession of her, which made her unbearable to herself and to all the world. She is now, after her reception, possessed by five demons, and beside her Louise Cappel by three; and the otherwise so peaceful convent becomes full of the noise and contortions of the possessed, so that terror and horror seize the superiors.\n\nHere too it is visibly apparent: that a somnambulistic predisposition lay at the foundation, which a bad priest had turned toward the demonic, and finally heightened to possession. The means he first employed was the breath, that aura in which so many natural connections are forged; in the ecclesiastical so often the conductor of the spirit from above and of his gifts, therefore also in the anti-ecclesiastical of the spirit from below and of his curse. The melancholy in early youth marks the first stage of the evil. This is heightened with persistently maintained sensuality, until the demonic witches' sleep with the entire scenery of the Sabbath has developed itself, and the second stage is now fully formed. Now the incipient partial possession emerges, and with it the third stage, where Asmodeus has taken possession of those organs to which the actions of sensuality are also directed. Finally the fourth stage has begun, when, in an impulse of return, those earlier melancholic attacks, still chained to the Sabbath time, have likewise returned, and now at last the full fivefold possession with all its manifestations sets in. \\"}, "The Possession of the Ursulines in Loudun and the Trial of Urbain Grandier": {"start_char": 1303514, "end_char": 1342809, "pages": "403-414", "keywords": ["the possession of the ursulines in loudun and the trial of urbain grandier"], "verbatim": " the liberation. The bishop died from the exertion and vexation.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with this story in Normandy, another highly remarkable event occurred in Loudun, a small town that separates the provinces of Touraine, Poitou, and Anjou from one another without ever having belonged to any of them. There, Urbain Grandier was the first pastor of the town at St.\u00a0Peter's, and moreover capitular at the foundation of the Holy Cross. He was one of those characters who, wherever they may be found, appear destined by nature to rule; for he combined great talent with an equal energy of will, and a rich vein of life dwelt in him within a tall stature. He was an outstanding preacher, knew how to express himself with grace and ease in social intercourse; a firm and penetrating spirit made itself known in all his utterances; thus he soon became a phenomenon in the little town. But he lacked the religious and ethical foundation upon which these gifts could develop. \\[Page 403\\]\n\nA great inclination toward lust had been given to him as an additional trait, and he soon allowed himself to be mastered by it. Sixty unimpeachable witnesses testified in his later trial to all the adulteries, incests, sacrileges, and other godless acts that he committed in his church, in the vicinity of the Sacrament, without distinction of time of day, at every hour and in every moment. In order to gloss over this licentiousness before his conscience, he wrote a treatise against celibacy, which was found among his papers along with various obscene poems under investigation. The old men whose daughters, and the men whose wives he dishonored, became furious against him; and he now turned the entire cutting sharpness of his character against them, instead of doing anything conciliatory.\n\nThe complaint of the injured parties was lodged with his bishop in Poitiers; he was arrested in connection with it, and by the judgment of the officialate on the third of January 1630 was interdicted for five years in the diocese, and forever in Loudun. He appealed to the archbishop of Bordeaux, who acquitted him; however, with the advice to exchange his benefices. But he instead made his entry into Loudun with a laurel branch in his hands; he pressed his hard-won right to the utmost point, held the cold point of mockery toward his enemies everywhere, and involved them one after another in quarrels and lawsuits of every kind. Thus he became the tyrant of the place, an object of fear and terror to the weak and of irreconcilable hatred to the strong.\n\nWhile the Catholics were thus averse to him in this way, and many did not attend his church, the Huguenots had taken his side. Loudun had been their stronghold in the earlier wars, and many of the Calvinists who lived there at the time judged not without reason that Grandier belonged in his innermost conviction to their sect, and that only the inevitable threatening loss of his benefices had held him back from openly joining them.\n\nThey therefore took his side without hesitation; it is true that in times when their confession lay wholly prostrate and Richelieu ruled with absolute power, these were dangerous allies. Thus stood things around him in the ordinary course of the world; but they had yet another side. Every person has a spiritual sphere of influence about himself, which, however, only extends in the inner circles, but in ordinary life, incorporated into the outer sphere of existence and enveloped by it, makes itself felt only through it and within it.\n\nBut if that interpenetration is partially suspended; if, without their being wholly separated from one another, a division nonetheless arises, and an overstepping of the inner over the outer occurs, whether in giving or receiving; then the intensive effects also disentangle themselves from the extensive ones, and spiritual rapports develop from the earlier physical sympathies and antipathies. Grandier, relying on his personal superiority, secured against the aversion of his fellow believers by the affections of their opponents, outwardly, as it seemed, unassailable, should yet not escape the fate of all pride, and Nemesis lay in wait for him on these night-shrouded paths. A convent of the then still new order of Ursulines had been established in Loudun since 1626. \\[Page 404\\]\n\nFourteen girls, all from good families, noble and non-noble, altogether of blameless life, had come together in one house; and, under the direction of a director, eked out, in their poverty, the continuance of their community through a pension school which they had founded. Things had proceeded in the usual tracks in this nascent convent, when the director died; Grandier, proposed as his successor, was rejected by the superior, and in his place Mignon, one of his adversaries, was chosen by the convent. The convent had been somewhat earlier disturbed by nocturnal apparitions, as the opponents said, or by the caprice of some nuns. Now disquieting signs began to appear, which were at first taken for symptoms of female illness and quietly sought to be dispelled.\n\nThe signs multiplied and became ever more unequivocal; the physicians had to be dismissed, and exorcists called in for aid. Dark rumors first flew through the town; soon the whole truth became known: fourteen nuns showed themselves possessed in the convent; the people took their children back, and while want and distress now entered among the nuns, they were regarded by some as those who had forsaken God, by others as fools and hysterical visionaries. The seal with which the nocturnal world is closed had been broken open for them; the first thing they perceived there was the magnet toward which the little town had long been accustomed to turn in hatred and love.\n\nTheir negatively demonic state sought about for an object on which it could complete itself; and found it in Grandier, brought into close rapport with them by his scoundrelly nature, pride, and hypocrisy. The relations of the sexes, which by day had friendly or hostile brought the female town into connection with him, had also here, conducting through the night, exerted their influence. For months the nuns saw him every night at their bedside, ceaselessly inciting them to evil; their statements gained credence when it was seen how, despite their bitter poverty, they remained blameless and fulfilled all the duties of their station with zeal and exactitude. In the exorcism the spirits named him unanimously as the one who had bound them in obsession. Into the mass of passions that had accumulated in the town, the igniting spark had now been cast. From the hearts the conflagration spread swiftly to the heads; everyone took sides for or against; Grandier and his closer adherents naturally did not remain idle, and great ferment began to stir in the little town.\n\nWhen the royal councilor Laubardemont arrived in Loudun to carry out the decree that ordered the demolition of all fortresses in the interior at the castle there, he found the entire city in the most violent agitation, which his mission only further increased. 619\\\nUpon his return, he made his report on this to King Louis XIII, and the latter instructed him, in late November 1633, to select thirteen of the most honest and skilled judges from the jurisdictions in the surrounding area, and with them to decide the matter without appeal. It happened as the king had commanded, and Grandier was provisionally arrested. In such exceptional courts, politics is to sit in judgment alongside the law. But that is an evil alliance, where one of the allies indeed represents the accused, while the other, speaking in the name of the whole, places the reason of state into the scales. \\[Page 405\\]\n\nIn times when this politics has not yet fully emancipated itself from conscience and morality, it will not demand of the judges that they declare the innocent guilty against their conviction; but it will nonetheless always, in doubtful cases where the verdict wavers, not hesitate to intervene subsidiarly and tip the scales. Grandier's case had become a party matter, and this had precisely provided the occasion to allow that alliance to enter the court as a counterforce. The more his party reacted, the more it had to increase the power of the political element. The conscience of the judges found its reassurance in the fact that, as soon became evident, Grandier's case had from the outset been ethically utterly lost; and the trial, conducted in the ordinary civil forms, had to lead to his ruin.\n\nThus the investigation into sorcery soon took a ominous turn for him, and it could be foreseen that it must lead to an evil outcome. However much the defeated party reviled the verdict, it did not dare to cast suspicion on the integrity of the thirteen judges; it reproached them only with all too great credulity: a reproach that, in a certain sense, but different from how it was meant here, was not entirely unfounded.\n\nThe commissioner Laubardemont began by taking the depositions of the witnesses; among them also those who had previously been frightened away from their testimony. The possessed were separated in houses, and then interrogated in their calm periods; the speeches that they delivered during their paroxysms, which the exorcism, performed each time by the Bishop of Poitiers, brought about, were to count only as indications for the further investigation. Their entire lives were subjected to the sharpest scrutiny; never did the statements of 20 individuals conflict on a point.\n\nThree and a half months of continued exorcism had demonstrated with evidence that they were truly in a state of obsession, for they had shown all the signs that the Church requires to determine the judgment on it. With regard to the understanding of languages, M. de Launoy de Razilly, who had long resided in America, gave testimony that he had spoken with the possessed in the language of some native tribes of that country; that they had answered him quite appropriately, and had also revealed to him several things that had occurred there. Some noblemen from Normandy testified that they had put questions to Sister Claire of Sazilly in Turkish, Spanish, and Italian, and that she had answered them satisfactorily. M. de Nismes, Doctor of the Sorbonne, one of the almoners of the Cardinal of Lyon, had posed his questions in German and Greek; Father Vignier, Superior of the Oratorians, likewise, for an entire afternoon, in the latter language: both had been completely satisfied. \\[Page 406\\]\n\nThe Bishop of N\u00eemes had commanded Sister Clara in Greek: to lift her veil and kiss the grating; she had obeyed, and done much else besides, so that he said: one must be a fool or an atheist to not believe in her possession. The doctors likewise questioned her about Greek expressions of their science known only to the initiated, and received clear answers. In the same way, the possessed obeyed commands that were given to them only inwardly. The Prior of Maillezais conducted such a test; he whispered in the ear of Canon Fernaison how he wished the possessed one, in the missal that lay at the grating, to place her finger on the beginning of the Mass of the Blessed Virgin, and the words: Salva, sancta parens lege. The exorcist, Mr.\u00a0von Morans, who had heard nothing of these words, now commanded her to follow the intention of the Prior. She fell into strong convulsions, spoke blasphemies, named the Prior, whom she did not know, by name, and after repeated commands, took hold of the missal, saying: I will pray, and now averting her eyes, placed her finger on the large S at the entrance of this Mass.\n\nA verbal record was taken of this event. As Mr.\u00a0von Milli\u00e8res knelt praying during the exorcism of Sister Clara, she asked him: whether he was praying a De Profundis for his wife? which was indeed the case. Sister Louise of Nogaret testified to the Marquis de la Mothe: that she had revealed to him the state of his conscience. Father Surin, whose truthfulness even the most vehement opponents never dared to question, testifies: how Johanna, the superior, revealed to him many hundreds of times the most secret things, and how a priest of his order directed an inner command to the demon, then revoked it inwardly with a second, and so on up to the seventh, and then he called out: Obediat ad mentem. The possessed repeated the first command and then said: but the Lord does not wish it, and so she continued with all six one after another; whereupon at the seventh she finally said: so let us then carry this out, wherein he had remained standing! In the same way, they came to the commands of the exorcists from distant places.\n\nThey astonished these by the quick answers they gave to the most difficult theological questions on grace, the vision of God, the angels, and the Incarnation, and indeed in the expressions of the School. They looked into the distance as they looked into the inner depths of souls: and while the superior Johanna, according to his testimony, revealed to Father Surin the secrets also of those whose guidance he had undertaken at his earlier residence in Marennes in Saintonge; the parliamentary councillor of Brittany, Kerioles, likewise made an experience of this gift that was decisive for his life. This man was sunk in all vices, without any religion or any faith; a raging atheist and of such rabid defiance that, when a thunderstorm rose in the sky, he directed the muzzle of his pistols against it, and once when the lightning struck his room, he, surrounded by fire and flames, while all his people cried for mercy, alone poured himself out in mockery and scorn. \\[Page 407\\]\n\nAll his thinking was forever directed only toward doing evil, and even more evil than all others; and he had once resolved to become a Mohammedan among the Turks, only so that he might have the opportunity to inflict all conceivable harm on the Christians. As all his thinking and striving were directed only toward atrocities and vices, so he also came to Loudun for such a goal and end; in short, one might well, in Surin's words, scarcely have seen a more despairing and vice-ridden man than this one. Immediately upon his arrival, he poured out his mockery over the nuns, and declared them all and sundry to be foolish. But God knows how to lead things to His end, and saved this bondsman of Satan through him himself.\n\nRight at the first exorcism, where he was present, the possessed revealed to him his most secret affairs, which no one could know except himself; so that he was most profoundly shaken. He returned a second time, and was now so moved and turned within himself that he performed terrible penance, and from then on led a holy life. The spirits confessed that it was the holy Virgin who had snatched him from their hands. He sold his position, later became a priest, and converted his house into a hospital. More than fifty doctors, one after another, declared in authentic verbal processes that what the possessed performed physically surpassed all the powers of nature.\n\nAt the command of the exorcists they went immediately, without their pulse changing in the slightest, into the most violent convulsions; the face became frightful to behold; the tongue protruded black, thick, hard, and covered with pustules from the mouth, without this hindering them in the least from speaking clearly. They supported themselves solely on their stomachs, placed the palms of their hands on the soles of their feet with their arms twisted or threw their heads back to their heels, and in this way ran quickly and much about. They remained awake continuously, and fasted sometimes uninterruptedly for 5--6 days; without this being detrimental to their health, but rather seeming only to strengthen that of the weaker ones.\n\nThey often fell suddenly asleep; in the case of Francisca Filastreau one then heard, with her mouth tightly closed, many voices quarreling about which of them should speak. One saw several times the Elisabeth Blanchard, in her convulsions, holding herself with her feet upward and her head downward on a chair or window without support. The superior Johanna, according to a verbal process, once hovered two feet above the ground. Lying full length, they were lifted up like statues without the slightest movement on their part. Many became flexible like a lead strip, so that one could bend them into any form, which they then retained. Others stretched their legs so far apart to left and right that their perineum touched the ground: the body held straight upright, the hands folded. In the case of the superior, the distance of one foot from the other in this position was seven feet, although she was only four feet tall.\n\nOn May 9, 1635, Monsieur, the brother of the king, came to Loudun to witness the events that were causing such a sensation throughout all of France. On the following day he went to the church of St.\u00a0Ursula, where Elisabeth Blanchard was to receive communion. She was possessed by six spirits, one of which, called Ashtaroth, soon stirred, and now, conjured by the exorcist, soon made her fall into convulsions: so that she, twitching and rolling about, crawled to the feet of the priest, who placed the holy Sacrament on her lips, at the same time commanding the demon: to undertake nothing irreverent against it, or even to moisten the host in any way. \\[Page 408\\]\n\nThe possessed woman was immediately thrown to the ground, bent backward three times so that she touched the ground with her feet and the tip of her nose; whereby it appeared as if she wanted to rub the host on the earth, as she came so close to it that only the thickness of the paper separated them.\n\nWhen the exorcist hindered the execution through his repeated prohibition, the demon raised the girl again and blew upon the host that was visible on his lips; it moved like a tree leaf in the breeze, oscillating between the lips. When the exorcist now adjured Beelzebub to ascend into her face, the throat swelled extraordinarily, became hard, and one felt a throbbing in it. Thus one of her spirits after the other was adjured to make itself visible, and each obeyed, distorting the face in a manner peculiar to it into something gruesome; whereby Astaroth, under the left armpit, produced a large swelling with violent throbbing, to the astonishment of the prince's body physician.\n\nHe then ascended, driven from there by the exorcist, into her face, and caused the host to fall onto the paten; where it was found, upon close examination by the exorcist's finger, entirely dry. The lips of the possessed were also in truth so parched that they peeled off, and the skin appeared entirely white. The exorcist now wiped her teeth with a cloth and brought the host to one of the upper row, where it, touching the jaw with only a part of its circumference, again hung there for a long time; despite the most violent shakings of the entire body, the strangest contortions of the mouth, and a violent blowing that the spirit produced. She was now commanded to swallow the forms, which happened immediately.\n\nThe exorcist now asked the body physician himself to examine the girl's mouth, to see whether the host was still present. He did so, by running his fingers along the gum to the throat, and thus convinced himself that nothing was present in the mouth. The girl was now allowed to drink water, and her mouth was examined again afterward. Upon the command that the exorcist now directed at Astaroth---to bring back the host---one saw it immediately thereafter on the tip of the tongue. The same test was repeated twice more. The prince was likewise an eyewitness to most of the above-mentioned phenomena, and had a detailed, authentic testimony drawn up about them, beginning with the words: Nous Gaston fils de France Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, certifions etc., under the 11th of May 1635.\n\nThe judges, under these circumstances, could not deny their belief in the truth of the obsession; they also prepared themselves churchly for their judicial office with earnestness, and examined the process for 40 days; Grandier was confronted with the witnesses, and these stood by their statements. He, for his part, denied everything, all the accusations made were lies or imaginings, and he had never engaged in magic. In doing so, he displayed the firmness of his character, and conducted himself throughout the course of the affair with cool blood and great composure and presence of mind. Since he denied the truth of the nuns' possession, he was called upon to conduct the exorcism himself. \\[Page 409\\]\n\nThe Bishop of Poitiers gave him permission and authority; he put on the stole, the possessed were brought into the choir of the church, and now a terrible scene began. He started the exorcism with Sister Catherine, the most ignorant of all, whom he adjured in Latin. But all the others were now seized at once, and began to howl and scream. Sister Clara was the loudest of all, and went at him; he therefore desisted from the former, and turned to her, who, however, without paying attention to him, spoke confused nonsense. The superior stepped in between, he now addressed her again, but had previously said: since she understood Latin, he would speak Greek to her. The response he received then was: Thou art cunning, for thou knowest full well that it is the first condition of the pact not to speak Greek; he had rightly replied: O pulchra illusio, egregia evasio!\n\nNow he was told: he should exorcise in Greek, but first write down what he intended to say. But the possessed ones fell anew into rage, raged and howled, suffered convulsions, accused him of sorcery, and offered to break his neck if it were permitted; but this, as was natural, the exorcists prevented. He himself remained calm and composed amid all the clamor, looked the possessed ones firmly in the eye, spoke of his innocence, and boldly requested only this: that they allow the demons to break his neck, or merely to make a mark on his forehead if he were truly guilty; yet none of the possessed might touch him in the process.\n\nThe exorcists brought the raging ones back to calm, and now a chafing dish was brought in to burn four documents of Grandier's that the possessed had submitted. This was done, but now the previous scene repeated itself with double the intensity; the confusion became indescribable, the screaming so piercing, the bearing so frightful, that the assembly---honoring the sanctity of the place---could pass for a true Sabbath. Grandier alone remained unshaken and expressed no astonishment, even though the raving ones threw all his sins in his face, which he in turn denied, renouncing Satan and declaring: that he was, in defiance of him, still a Christian, and more than that, a priest; at times he even joined with the assembled people in singing hymns. This continued, the fury against him increasing from time to time, and he would have been torn apart had the bystanders not prevented it and led him out of the church. On that day they had all the trouble in the world to calm the nuns again.\n\nOne must not be astonished at this rabid uproar and this tumult of the powers of hell in human nature. Grandier, a man vigorous in outward life but morally decayed toward death within, unworthy as he might always have been as a priest: now confronted the demonic forces, armed with all the power and authority of the Church, in order to exorcise them. The nuns, as such belonging likewise more closely to the Church, of blameless conduct in their free moments, quiet and good-natured by nature, who carried within themselves the full subjective sense of the man's entanglement---sober though it was---in the demonic, now heard the words of exorcism from his mouth. \\[Page 410\\]\n\nIt had to turn out as when a drop of water falls into red-hot molten copper; their own demonic element had to rise up in wrath and explode terribly. But the entire event could lead to the trace of the whole error and make it comprehensible: that here opposing spheres, which could never understand one another, had come into conflict; and that therefore none could give testimony against the other. Grandier was well aware of his crimes and the untenability of his inner foundation; since every sin entwines itself with the demon, he---as a priest though he was---must know himself to be entangled and confused with him as well. But his sins were of a prosaic nature, committed in clear deliberation, and thus the bond was of like kind; but of actual sorcery he knew himself to be free, and he did not consider it possible that such a thing could be proven against him. Hence his cool-headedness and composure, which now had to explain the nuns' accusations as a work of lies and the malice of his enemies.\n\nThe possessed, for their part, were free from all deliberate deceit; they beheld what they uttered with full, subjective conviction of its truth; for the inner side of the man was turned toward their own inner being, and they merely bore witness to what they found inscribed there. But the language in which it was inscribed was a symbolic one, which they, in reading it, had only to translate into the ordinary tongue. The entanglements into which he had fallen with the demon on his path, however, led directly, on their paths, back into their own inner selves; for the same demon had also seized and ensnared them, albeit in a mystical manner; and the same phallic symbols, which appeared frequently in that process and expressed the connection in their intuitions, returned also for the other relations, and they interpreted them in their mystical language. And just as he, on his side, found their accusations---taking them according to the letter---unfounded, and therefore declared them to spring from infamous malice; so the others, in turn, misunderstood this denial of his, and they marveled and were outraged at the shamelessness that dared to deny what lay so clearly and openly before their eyes, even to the point of tangibility.\n\nThus the matter became ever more deeply confused with every step forward, until it reached utter inextricability; and it could not be expected of the judges that they, alone, should peer beyond the spiritual horizon of the time into the inner recesses of these entanglements. They had the choice: either to declare an entire convent, along with all who had taken part in the affair, as accomplices in a grievous, devilish deception; or to find guilty the one whose evil character they knew full well. If the nuns had recognized him---whom, according to their assurances, they had never seen---at the very first confrontation; then they could not know that this might, at most, be explained by natural clairvoyance.\n\nThey had no experiences yet to show that the convulsions which seized the obsessed upon the mere mention of his name gave no conclusive testimony to his objective guilt. If one of the spirits of the superior Johanna had indicated the spots on his body marked by five signs; and now eight physicians, sent to search for them on him, believed they had truly found only two---one on the shoulder, the other on the scrotum---because the needle, driven in there thumb-thick, had produced only a dull pain, and no blood had followed---; then they could not know that even these signs, if they were indubitably present, led into error. \\[Page 411\\]\n\nThe coincidence of a scar on his thumb with a few drops of blood on an attached prescription gave free play to every interpretation. The judges, assembled for the last time, pronounced all unanimously: \"We convict, and declare the said Urbain Grandier guilty and convicted of the crime of magic, witchcraft, and possession caused by his actions, in the persons of certain Ursuline nuns of this town of Loudun and other secular individuals; together with the other cases and crimes resulting from this.\"\n\nAlthough no court of today, even a thoroughly Catholic one, would render such a judgment in this case; yet one may fully credit the reporter when, in the *Relation veritable* p.\u00a043, he says: they had felt a complete satisfaction in their consciences at their verdict. Before his execution, he was to be put to the torture in the usual manner, in order to discover his accomplices. But he utterly denied having any such; even in the midst of harsh torment he said only that he was no sorcerer, but otherwise he had in truth committed greater crimes than this. When asked: what crimes? he replied: such as arise from human frailty; adding: it would have cost him more to confess these than that of which he was accused.\n\nWhen they prepared to lead him to his death, he refused every consolation, and pushed away the crucifix that was offered to him. Thus he mounted the pyre; it had been granted to him that he should first be strangled before the flames consumed him; but these seized the rope before the executioner could carry out the deed. So he fell into the flames, which mercilessly devoured the unfortunate man; he who had not the comfort of a clear conscience, and who spurned the consolations of religion because he believed himself abandoned by it.\n\nAs he had fallen into the conflict between unbridled sensuality and the duties of his station; so in its train had he fallen into the other, between the inner and outer world, which then entangled him in the third, the external one between Catholics and Huguenots; and now he was torn asunder, as the opposing whirlpools that had seized him pulled him apart. His contemporaries found the judgment of the judges not unjust; only fifty years later, after judges and witnesses had long since died, did Aubin, an exiled Huguenot, write his book. Grandier had here fallen as a victim of the powerful Richelieu, against whom he was said to have written a satire; Laubardemont was the instrument of the minister, Mignon and Barr\u00e9 were the infamous mountebanks who had trained the nuns in their arts; the Bishop of Poitiers and all others who had otherwise taken part in the affair were in agreement; all the rest, Monsieur and the court at their head, weak, credulous fools; all this set forth with bold courage, without further warrant of the facts, and argued through with great intellectual sharpness in a rationalizing manner.\n\nIt was the protestation of the ruling exclusive understanding, directed against the equally exclusive inner vision; the rational times that now followed allowed no other word to arise in this matter, and for them it rested in the manner in which this their spokesman had presented it\u00b9\u207e. With the death of Grandier, moreover, the matter of the possessions in the convent was by no means settled; they continued for a long time after this catastrophe in all their violence. The act had been of too tragic a nature for the surroundings who had taken part in it to entirely escape participation in this character. \\[Page 412\\]\n\nTherefore an uncanny spirit went among them, striking to the right and to the left at whatever it encountered. The civil lieutenant Louis Chauvet had taken Grandier's side in the trial, especially in the beginning of the exorcisms, and one of the possessed had later accused him too of sorcery. Terror had now become his demon, and he fell into a state in which he was never again seen fully in his senses thereafter. The surgeon Mannoury, who had examined the accused for stigmatization with the probe, was once going home at night after his death, and suddenly recoiled: Ah, Grandier! what do you want from me? The apparition did not leave him until his own death, which occurred a few days later. Father Lactance, one of the exorcists, felt, while he was occupied with the exorcism, brought upon himself manifold reactions; he soon lost his sight, his memory, then again his senses; he suffered now from heartache, then again from temptations in the spirit; he likewise fell ill a few days after Grandier's death, and died after having endured great demonic assaults.\n\nFive years later, P. Tranquillus, a man of saintly demeanor, died of the same affliction. Everything that had previously transpired over two years in Loudun around him repeated itself in him; without it being able to shake him inwardly, and it did not cease from him even later. When he was supposed to preach at vespers, the tumult became so severe that he did not dare to step forward; his confessor now adjured the demon to release him; immediately he ascended the pulpit and preached for the last time in a way that carried all his listeners away; only with the last unction did the demon depart from him, and seized a brother who was present. All the terrors of hell that had been unleashed in that conflict, while all human passions raged around them, must of themselves have exercised a destructive effect upon sensitive souls; but party spirit, forgetting that friends and enemies alike experienced this influence equally, and that it had itself declared the whole affair a play of human depravity, now unhesitatingly believed in the full truth, in order to recognize therein the work of retributive Nemesis.\n\nIn any case, the idea of such retribution has no application to Father Surin, who did not come to Loudun until four months after Grandier's death. Soon he too found himself there in that interchange with the spirits of Jeanne previously described; so that once, in the presence of the Bishop of N\u00eemes, one of them, during the exorcism, threatened him vehemently from the face of the possessed; then suddenly vanished from there, but instead manifested itself in him through pressure on the breast and loss of speech. Driven out from there by ecclesiastical means, it appeared anew on the face of the superior in all its hideousness, while the father on his side again found himself entirely free. \\[Page 413\\]\n\nThis repeated itself on one morning perhaps up to the eighth time; he was struck as if by an arrow, suddenly thrown to the ground, so that he cried out, and they had to touch him with the sacrament at the places where he felt the demon, in order to free him again. Concerning his inner state during this, the sufferer expressed himself in a very remarkable manner in a letter to his fellow order brother P. Dumesnil in Rennes, dated May 3, 1635. There he says among other things: I cannot explain to you what takes place in me during this time, and how this spirit unites itself with mine, without taking from my soul either its consciousness or its freedom; while it yet behaves like my other self, as if I had two souls, one of which is deprived of the use of its organs, and now, holding itself at a distance, looks on at the doings of the other.\n\nThe two spirits contend with each other on the same battlefield, the body, and the soul is as if divided, open in the one to hellish impressions, in the other surrendered to its own movements, or to such as come from God. In the same moment I feel a great peace under God's good pleasure, and at the same time I cannot comprehend the raging aversion against him, which calls forth a fury to separate me from him; to the astonishment of all who see it. At the same time great joy and gentleness come over me, and then again a sadness that manifests itself in complaints and in a screaming, as the demons induce it.\n\nI feel and fear the state of damnation, and sense that foreign soul which seems to me to be my own, pierced by despair as if with thorns; while the other, full of good trust, mocks such sensations, and in all freedom curses the one who calls them forth. In truth, I recognize that that cry which issues from my mouth arises equally from these two souls, and I am at a loss to decide whether it is joyfulness that forces it out, or the extraordinary rage that fills me. The trembling that seizes me when the holy Sacrament is brought near to me seems, as I sense, to have its origin just as much in the abhorrence of its proximity, which is unbearable to me, as in a heartfelt and gentle reverence, without my being able to decide or command that it is more the one or the other.\n\nIf I wish, at the urging of the one, to mark my mouth with the cross, the other pulls my arm back with great hatred, and makes me seize the finger with my teeth and bite it in rage. In such storms I always find prayer the easiest; while the body writhes on the ground, and the servants of the church speak to me as to a devil, and pronounce curses against me. I cannot describe to you the joy I feel in being a devil in such a manner; not through rebellion against God, but through the calamity which sincerely shows me the state into which sin has placed me: and as I apply the pronounced imprecations to myself, my soul can immerse itself in its own nothingness. \\[Page 414\\]\n\nWhen the other possessed see me in this state, it is a joy to observe how they rejoice, and how the demons make merry over me, saying: Physician, heal thyself now! Mount the pulpit, it would be fine to hear you preach after you have thus wallowed on the ground. --- My state is such that few entirely free actions remain to me. If I wish to speak, my tongue fails me; in the Mass I must suddenly stop; at the table I cannot bring the bite to my mouth; in confession all sins suddenly escape me, and I feel that the devil goes in and out of me as in his own house. When I wake, he is there; when I pray, he stirs my thoughts at will; when the heart begins to open itself to God, he fills it with rage; he lulls me to sleep when I would stay awake, and through the mouths of my possessed he publicly boasts: he is my master, against which I can raise no objection.\n\nThus two demons deal with me, one is Leviathan, the adversary of the Holy Spirit, and the operations of this false Paraclete are entirely the opposite of those of the true one; they produce a desolation that cannot be described; he is the chief of the band of all demons who here perform this strangest of all things, and we have here at once paradise and hell together, and the nuns 634 here are in one sense true Ursulas, in another sense worse than the most lost ones in filth, blasphemies, and fits of rage.\n\nThis remarkable self-confession of a man who surely never let an untrue word pass his lips appears instructive and worthy of great attention in many respects. First, it teaches us to know this state of inner decomposition of the indivisible I in man, which in its higher conscious half walks before and after in the light of grace: while the lower, more deeply entangled with the body, other side lies in the shadowing of the nocturnal principle, and everywhere desiring the opposite and driving to accomplish it, yet is recognized by the observing higher self as its other I. Secondly, the testimony imprints on the other, concerning the reality of the nuns' affliction, who were in states only still more highly intensified, the final seal of certainty.\n\nWhat finally happened to him in such a manner; what later for twelve more years did not leave him; what once in a paroxysm led him to jump out the window of his order's house, so that he broke a leg, and only later finally left him, so that he for a long time thereafter led a quiet, pious life; what befell the other two exorcists: all this shows us the dangers that are connected with the practice of exorcism.

But since they would not cease, he had some of them beaten nearly to death, and treated them in such a way that they dared not show themselves for a considerable time; by which means many were also betrayed, and entered into"}, "The Innocent Confession Related by George Mackenzie": {"start_char": 1366091, "end_char": 1366751, "pages": "422-423", "keywords": ["hessimont convent possession near neumagen"], "verbatim": "most beautiful girl in W\u00fcrzburg.---With most of them it will have been as it was with those of whom George Mackenzie tells: When I presided over a court, I went to question some women more closely who had judicially confessed their guilt. One among them, a simple creature, said to me: she had not confessed because she was guilty, but because she had to live poorly from her work; now, however, being called a witch, she would die of hunger. For no one would take her in any longer, or give her food; rather, they would beat her and set dogs upon her.\n\nTherefore she had wished to be dead; at this she wept bitterly, and tearfully called upon God as witness o"}, "Father Surin's Exorcism of the Possessed Johanna in Loudun": {"start_char": 1393405, "end_char": 1397925, "pages": "432-433", "keywords": ["- surin exorcism of prioress loudun"], "verbatim": "The practice prescribed here was the same that, more than a century and a half earlier, the worthy judges of Del Rio had already followed; in it, therefore, the view of the Church on the matter is expressed.\n\nEven in the particulars, the clerics who acted in its spirit and according to the mildness of the doctrine arranged their procedure according to similar principles. They understood: that everywhere it depends more on the improvement and instruction of the unfortunates than on the intervention of a bloody terrorism; which only incites the wild, rending beast in man to lust, in order to tear it to pieces. This is already evident in the manner in which Father Surin treated the obsessed in the convent of Loudun.\n\nHere he did not wield the sharpness of the sword, not even did he make frequent use of exorcism; for he understood: that above all he himself, with his person, must stand surety for those entrusted to him. He therefore first turned in persistent prayer to God and his saints, the Virgin at their head, that help might come to him from there; and he held himself, during the course of many years, unceasingly in this prayerful communion. And the spirits cried out in the possessed: that this was the way to torment them and bring them to ruin. Into the same communion he soon also drew the obsessed Johanna; and as she too learned to maintain herself persistently in it, one of her spirits was thereby alone, without exorcism, compelled to depart.\n\nHe further judged that the main reason for the connection of man with the demon lay in the sins and evil habits of the former; all the more so, the deeper these were rooted; thus that in the measure in which sin was more present in a soul, all the more the devil would take root in it and triumph. Therefore, one must above all strive to eradicate this main cause, and thereby weaken the powers of the demon. This was also acknowledged by the spirits, as they cried out again: We have no more than what the vices of men give us; if these are eradicated, then we must succumb and depart from here.\n\nHe therefore continually exercised Johanna in the struggle with these her evil inclinations of the corrupted nature; her progress therein was soon attested by the spirits, who threatened him because he was introducing a completely new method, and offered themselves to all obedience if only he would cease therewith; for it was the greatest misfortune for them on earth to possess a mortified person, whose slaves they would be, instead of ruling her in her evil inclinations. She still had four spirits, and Father Surin devised the plan to attack each in his own stronghold. The one who drove her to all pranks, and the other who drove her to all pleasures; both he subdued by instilling in her the spirit of a earnestly strict penitence. She slept therefore on the hard ground, scarcely made any fire, scourged herself three times a day most sharply, wore a cilice and a chain around her body, fasted almost always, abstained from all fruits that she loved, and also ate with it many things that seemed to burden her in her stomach weakness. \\[Page 432\\]\n\nThereupon he also attacked the other spirits, who had taken up position in the proud-anger part, and combated them with humility and patience. When she therefore boasted under the impulse of her spirits; then he had her thrown down by beggars, trampled with muddy feet, and struck on the mouth. He sent her to the sister cook with the request: to give her a discipline, which the latter then performed quite simply. He made her publicly ashamed, for which she always thanked him afterward, and begged him to tell every man all her sins that she had confessed to him in a general confession. As she could not obtain this from him, she herself confessed before her fellow sisters her greatest and most shameful sins, and also made a vow to become a lay sister.\n\nIn the same way he combated the natural laziness in her, kept watch over all her gestures, words, and works, killed off in them everything that he noted as wrong, proceeding in each from the principle that the improvement of souls is more a work of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and of prayer than of science. The spirits let their impatience and displeasure appear in the course of the whole procedure: that they were forced to remain in a place where no nourishment and no space was left for them. But the purpose was achieved as desired; the demons departed one after another, each marking the forehead or hand with the name "}}
